"> If I try and force down a breakfast I start gagging.

Yes!

People were so condescending about it when I got my first job out of college. It was 40 minutes away from home and I had to be there at 7:30. They would go on and on about how I'll ""get used to it"". But it has been a few years now and I'm not used to it (new job is much closer to home, and pretty relaxed about me getting there anytime before 8:30).

I've gotten BETTER, sure. I generally wake up around 8 on weekends, whereas I used to never wake up that early. I do love mornings once I'm finally awake, and I like that I can run a bunch of errands and it only be 11AM. But still -- I think having to be at work at 9-10AM would be ideal. Just that extra hour of sleep makes all the difference for me. 

Waking up at 7AM = kill me.
Waking up at 8AM = comes pretty naturally, and I'm okay with it."
"> The old website had it clearly stated that games were being judged on their creativity and their engagement but not necessarily on their playability. 
 
Which sounds worlds better than what they have now, which frankly doesn't give any guidelines on what is being judged other than ""must be 200 words or less"". Heck, they could even use a few more rules on that... does the Title of the game count? What about math equations, Tables, etc? 
 
Leaving that aside the current (lacking) rules though, ""creativity & engagement"" does not equate to 'dinner party' style games only (if someone can give me a slightly less condescending sounding term for these games, please do. Not my intention to put them down). They are objectively not what the majority of people think of when for the term ""RPG"".

No it's not. There's a way to say the same thing without being an arrogant condescending dickhead. There's nothing constructive about saying something is ""atrocious"", it's straight from the Comic Book Guy thesaurus, just like ""horrid"".

It wasn’t upvoted because it was unpopular; on the contrary, it was upvoted BECAUSE everyone agreed with it.

I didn't even mention 4 million in my last post, and every time I have I've added the modifier to placate you. 

> I could easily see a hyped MMA fight getting bet on significantly more than an average NFL game, so say $10 million.

Uh what ? You think a hyped MMA fight could get over double an NFL game ? are you serious ? The fact you think an MMA event (muchless Bellator 138!!!) could get 10% action of the SUPER BOWL is utter confounding. Nevermind the fact this wasn't UFC 100 or something, some multi title fight, or some PPV star this was friggin Bellator 138 with the main event of Kimbo Slice vs Ken Shamrock. You believe this was one of the biggest MMA events ?!

"> I don't think the developers don't care about the users.

I think a more accurate statement would be that the Pidgin developers believe they always know best, and any users who disagree with them are just the ignorant, unwashed masses who must be led to the light by their noses. It's not the users they don't care about -- it's the users' opinions, when those opinions are not entirely complimentary of the Pidgin devs.

That's my impression, anyway.

I've been ""evaluating"" the ""new UI"" since it was handed down from on high, and my opinion of it is still that it's not awful -- but it could be better (mostly by being what it was before the changes).

Really, who's the alpha anything here? You are the first who mentioned cocks. Familiarity breeds contempt, and I'd really suggest you look in the mirror.

But just in case you actually are a civil person who somehow managed to misread me that badly, let's unpack this:

I am not complaining about your use of terminology. If you'd called it an so, it would still be just as limited. My point was and is about the advantages of a service over a dynamically-linked anything.

> Which was the important point. It's a technique that will work, and allow you to move to a Service w/o any interruption when it becomes obvious that it's needed...

This is true. In fact, this is more or less how I develop these -- start with a single application, and try to keep enough of an abstraction layer within that application that I can extract the model layer into a service if needed.

A counterpoint is that there may be assumptions that leak into the design when you build a local API (the DLL) rather than a network one, and that REST forces you to make things as stateless and idempotent as possible (a good thing for network services). But that's true of any change of implementation -- abstractions leak, and we can't always pick the perfect implementation every time.

> But of course, that wasn't the point. The point was that you're smarter than I am, and most of reddit I'm guessing.

So I disagree with you on one point -- and it doesn't even look like we disagree much -- and somehow from this, you read a massive ego and superiority complex, to the point where the only way you can communicate with me is to talk about cock-waving?

Seriously?

You made this personal, not me. I'd still like it to not be personal, and this much vitriol in a response to a neutrally-toned comment suggests it's not about me at all. Maybe you're just having a bad day, or worse?

"> It's like speculating if a person's hair color is natural or not

That's also a bad thing to do. Speculating about somebody's private life is harmless if it stays as pure speculation, but it never does. It always turns into judgement, gossip and rumour-mongering pretty much instantly.

I mean, just look at the OP of this thread. Condescendingly telling a straight guy ""I know you're actually a bisexual, and it's silly of you not to publicly acknowledge it"" is a really ugly and insensitive thing to do.

"> You're trying to tell me that you judge the likelihood of communicated facts being true based on the probability that you think they are true.

No. I proportion my beliefs to the evidence. Ordinary claims require ordinary evidence, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

For example if my wife told me she had a coffee this morning it would be a very ordinary claim, my wife drinks alot of coffee! The evidence I would require to believe this claim would be ordinary, heck I would probably be inclined to just believe her when she says she had a coffee because it happens so often.

If my wife told me she gave birth to a God that is a completely different story. It is an extraordinary claim, the evidence I would require to believe this claim would also need to be extraordinary. I trust my wife, but that doesn't mean I would simply believe whatever she said regardless of how extraordinary it is.

> I'm telling you that I based the likelihood of communicated facts being true based on the history of past experiences with the source of the communication.

Sure, I think we all do this to an extent but you seem to setting up this frankly odd dichotomy where you believe everything a certain source says whilst you simultaneously disbelieve everything another source says.

Are you seriously suggesting that if a source you trust, your partner, friend or whomever, told you something extraordinary like that they gave birth to a God that you would simply believe them without evidence because they told the truth in the past? You do accept that people can lie or that they can simply be wrong right?

> I did not set out to make any proof of miracles, since that would go directly against my original argument.

Right but the only reason you have presented in support of you belief in miracles is that you believe in the supernatural. I don't want this to come across as condescending but essentially all your saying is that you believe in miracles because you believe miracles could happen. That is nice and all but it says absolutely nothing about whether miracles do actually happen.

You gave a specific example of a miracle that you believe happened, that a virgin gave birth to a God. Why do you believe this happened?"
"Excellent analysis. It's very important not to get hung up on the distant origin of words (the ""etymological fallacy""), because the evolution of language is a haphazard process that does not rely on formal definitions.

However, I think you might have this part backwards:

> In more modern times the word has evolved the mean something more in line with treating someone like a customer, and I think everyone has had the experience of being ""patronized"" by an employee trying to sell them something.

The patron was the person giving the money, not hoping to receive it, therefore to patronise means to behave like a customer towards an employee, not vice versa. In fact the word is still occasionally used in the sense of ""patronising a business"", meaning to visit and spend your money there, although this is far less common than the sense of acting condescendingly, which presumably reflects the way in which rich and self-important customers sometimes treat employees they believe are there to serve them."

">The game isn't meant to attack the player.

While I agree that it's not the intent, I find it condescending in the same way I find Jersey Shore condescending. It's not attacking the audience, but its existence implies that the producers think it's something the audience would enjoy. (I'm talking about the details like ""Dudebro"" and using Jon St. John, not the gameplay itself.)

It's not the worst thing ever, or anything like that. It just seems...immature. And its creation seems like the developers think that the gaming audience is immature as well. It's really the same problem I had with Duke Nukem (after Duke Nukem 3D).

Perhaps it is just an extended parody. Well, it almost certainly is, I don't mean to say it isn't. But the other side of my issue with it lies with the fandom itself. A lot of the fandom seems to defend it by saying there's a dearth of 90's style games, and they've wanted one for so long. And I wonder how many of those fans would like ""Dudebro"" if it didn't have the veneer of Duke Nukem plastered on it.

"> Tournaments aside, you don't see a problem with banning this guy's account over this incident? Legal or not, I think there's a fairly strong case it's at least unethical.

Personally I'm ok with the banning. He never acknowledged that what he did is monstrous and his statements didn't convey the words of a man who was sorry for what he did. In fact his statement was primarily him gloating about what he has achieved after committing the rape. These are not traits that I admire in a person. Clearly WoTC does not admire these traits either and has decided to cut ties.

Wrt the ethics of the banning, those arguments will depend on the ethical system you use. Ethics aren't some real thing in the world, it's very subjective and predicated on axioms.

> It's a PR move at the expense of a player. These things aren't to be taken lightly. As I said in a previous comment, what if a conservative general store banned anyone with a past criminal record from their store?

The ban is most likely do to his perceived character. A blanket ban on people with criminal histories is not a good ban. It's arbitrary. I've been to stores where players have felonies as well but are assets to their local community while other law-abiding citizens have been banned for having bad attitudes that lead to an unpleasant atmosphere. There is a very real community to consider and the context of the situation needs to be evaluated when making these value judgments.

WotC simply does not want to be associated with a confessed rapist who is not sorry for what he did. 

> Okay, you know what I mean here. Betting on games is bad because it creates incentives for teams to play in a manner that does not place winning as a top priority. It influences on-field behavior which is to say it distorts and harms the product. It's more akin to cheating than it is to Jesse's predicament. I don't think many people would protest a ban of this magnitude if he were betting on games or mana weaving.

Magic is very much about community. The vast majority of players are casual players. WotC wants the game to appeal to children and to women. You can see why having a player who comes off as proud of his rape potentially winning a pro tour doesn't help advance WotC's goals. 

> I don't follow the MtG scene, do you have evidence of such a ban? If these sorts of bans are commonplace, I suppose it would make the out-roar a bit ridiculous, but it would also make WoTC horribly inept at player relations.

It's happened a few times that writers who've put their foot in their mouth have ceased to find work with WotC or issued public apologies. Players too, most recently with the whole GoyfGate fiasco. Owen Turtenwald said some stupid shit and to save face he made a non-apology. He's also been getting less work as a writer, probably not just a correlation. 

Just about a month or two ago a commentator was caught by a hot mic saying racist things about a certain class of magic player, he quickly lost his job. Nearly every time women's issues come up in the Magic community somebody in a position of influence says or does something that damages the public image of the game. Most recently Jim Davis (not of Garfield fame) wrote an article that was supposed to support women's representation in competitive magic but it just came of as condescending and did more harm than good. His article was almost immediately yanked and an apology released.

I disagree, but maybe because I grew up in a household where debate was encouraged. My wife didn't, so to her, any sarcasm can be hurtful. Which only goes to illustrate that this is a very subjective thing and should therefore likely be taken with a very thick skin (or don't debate if it's hurts too much). 

>I think that it's dishonest and uncalled for regardless of the side. 

I think you're missing that this is a very subjective judgement that can be aimed at both sides equally. What you consider condescension I likely consider merely being firm in my understanding. There is obviously a range, but I rarely see it so blatant that anyone would take offense. Usually what I see is someone who feels its condescending to say, ""Where's the evidence for god?"" and then not accepting personal anecdote. I don't see that as condescending, I see it as what everyone should do as a matter of course since anecdote has such a poor history. 

>irreparable harm to the image of atheism.

I don't see that, really, I don't. What I see is a strong reaction to what has been centuries of abusive privileged that is finally starting to crumble. Angsty teens promoting any cause tend to be dismissed over the course of time (except for the changes they've made). Look at the major social changes in our recent history. Most of them started with someone being 'rude' to someone who expected their beliefs to be above reproach. Fifty years later, we look back at that expectation and wonder how they could have been so bigoted. We don't really remember how brave, rude, sarcastic, or downright violent the perpetrators of the change had to be in order to not only get noticed, but start social pressure swinging their way. I see the swing beginning, but it's working against a ton of momentum and centuries of 'special treatment'. Which means the rising push against that special treatment is going to be especially long and somewhat more painful. "

"> When you’re modmessaged, banned, and downvoted, what’s your reaction? Do you feel resentful and defensive? Do you feel compelled to prove yourself right?

I depended. On the feminist subs, I kind of saw it coming and/or wasn’t surprised. I didn’t comment to get banned, but one of the times I was fairly sure I would and commented anyway. 

On other subs, it was somewhat infuriating, because I wasn’t expecting it, it reinforced the unpopularity of my sincerely held beliefs, and usually featured a mod on a power trip, being intentionally condescending and “unprofessional.” The blatant lack of respect and civility from an authority figure was probably the worst part of it. To add insult to injury, when I appealed the decision via modmail, I’d get insta-muted, and I always suspected it was the same mod who made the original decision. 

The experience that hurt the most though was one of my best friends of 16 years essentially calling me a bitter, insecure misogynist (although he didn’t precisely use those words) for my views. I was used to being stereotyped by strangers for expressing them, but when my friend did it, I felt like he should have known me better than that. It hurt, because it shattered my view of our friendship, and my belief that what made it so strong was our ability to respectfully disagree with each other over close to anything. We never really spoke again. I’ve gotten over it (took about a month), but I won’t deny that it’s made me just a tad more cynical about the integrity of friendships in general. "

Stuff like this makes me think that the most extreme Europeans are the liberal ones. The nationalists, whatever you may think of them, are more defensive in nature. They want to retreat/isolate themselves. The liberals have this zeal that the rest of the world must be like them, but at the same time they have a huge condescending and patronising view of the developing world.

You combine that with a pathological need to change everyone into your mirror image and you get colonialism. Let's not forget that this was the same impulse that drove people like Macaulay. He was a liberal of his time, yet at the same time wanted to force Indians to become like the Brits and held deeply patronising, if not outright racist, views of his subjects. You see the same mentality creep in here. Western liberals."

So 1 night I forgot my iPhone at work so I sat outside of my room on my balcony watching my TV through my window. After about 10 mins into watching some netflix my sister comes in and starts going through our drawers. My heart sank, she was right! I shouted at my sister and she looked around the room wondering where I was but didn't see my standing at the window so she ran out like ""uhhh nothing, looking for something"". Later on that night I sat down with my girl and apologized countless of times for not listening after seeing it myself. Meanwhile I see her (my sister) treat complete strangers with this care and warmth that really angers me when I don't see transfer to my girl. It's like ""this is the woman that takes care and loves your brother.. Why can't you be happy!"" "

Her main criticism of feminist discourse is that too much of it revolves around what she calls ""college girl"" feminism - which can include a tendency to over-outrage, and which can be condescending to the very large set of working women or leave their voices out entirely. 

I guess the online equivalent is the popular criticisms against tumblr-feminism, that at its worst it can become a circle-jerk, reactionary, shrill, focus outrage where calm discussion would be more useful, fall into blame-all-men traps, and so on.

To me, that seems to be an apt comparison. To be dismissed as being over tired, hungry, over stimulated etc.

And even then, when you're a child, these things objectively make sense because you are objectively less developed and need adult guidance, children mostly don't have the capacity to see this as condescending and an adult thinking back to their childhood years won't in average remember her/himself as mistreated in that aspect. Being a woman is more like being a fully conscious, capable adult but everyone around you agrees to pretend that you're a child, including some women who intentionally make themselves seem more childlike.

How did Tharja get recruited into the Shepards during the OG timeline, the one where she was over the top evil?

Emmeryn was dead before her recruitment chapter happens, so there's no sense of her being swayed by Chrom showing up to rescue his sister. Did she join up after the Plegian War?

">Disputing the ""always"" was my way to ask for something more concrete because you were being vague. I'm not interested in arguing about semantics.

Well let's see...she has a negative outlook towards her family, Hachiman (she likes him as a person but despises his behavior, I think she even used the word despise too), hurls verbal abuse at people over things that could easily be resolved without insults, almost never smiles even in private unless she's putting on a facade, condescends people even if they're trying (when she managed the festival committee she was constantly talking about what the other committee members have yet to do, never once acknowledging their work), and overall rarely demonstrates the slightest passion for life. Is that enough points for you?

>Yukino is simply more reserved than usual..? I don't know what else to tell you man.

Tell me that you acknowledge her edginess lmfao. You do realize that literally every edgelord behavior is a matter of quantity not just quality right? A lot of people will exhibit small amounts of edgelord behavior. If dabbling in small amounts of edgelord behavior makes people edgelords then practically everyone is an edgelord. There's a reason why even though I cited an example of Hayato acting edgy I have never once said he's an edgelord - yea he was being nihilistic and negative and saying shock value phrases but he doesn't do it frequently enough to be an edgelord. 

Yukino is not just more reserved than usual. Hachiman is already absurdly reserved and Yukino is somehow far above that. Please don't try to handwave abnormal behaviors away into thin air.

>Again, she's not very outgoing, more of an introvert, tendency to be blunt, kinda awkward, etc. It's not easy for everyone.

No, Yukino really can make more friends if she put in even a slight amount of effort in. She's smart, pretty, comes from an excellent background, and, as edgy as she is, she's a good person at heart. She might never fit in with the ""in"" group, but what about the other introverts? The book club people? The chess team? The other high achievers who care more about studying than gossip and makeup? There's no shortage of other introverts in society that are going to be willing to accept a beautiful talented introvert friend. I had way less going for me than Yukino and I could still make friends easily once I dropped the edgelord behavior. In fact, I made friends even while I was so edgy that my english teacher thought I was doing it on purpose as a joke. I made edgelord friends during that time. Not a lot, but they were there.

Yukino might have a time making extremely close friends even if she dropped the edgelord act due to some of her fixed personality traits. I get that. I REALLY get that. But for her to almost completely lack even normal friends is just a symptom of her being almost Hachiman levels of edgy. Fuck dude, right in episode 1 Hachiman extended the olive branch to her and she refused him on the spot before he could even complete the sentence. Please, stop giving Yukino a free pass. She lacks friends out of conscious choice to stay true to her edgelord ways, not because she can't make friends.

>Examples of her being ""toxic as fuck""?

Easy. Absolutely shits on Hachiman in episode 1 when they just met (being the fair person that I am I won't count the occasional jabs she threw at him throughout the entire series on account of it being friendly banter). Made Miura cry at summer camp (not going to count the tennis court incident since Yukino was provoked there). Shit on the other school's student council during christmas prep (yea they were idiots I get it, but when even Hachiman says you've gone too far, there's an issue). When Miura comes to the volunteer club for help.

>I don't remember this happening.

When talking with Hachiman in episode 1 regarding why Yukino lacks friends:

""The human race is weak, ugly, jealous, and hate those with more than them. Strangely enough, it's the talented that have it rough."" 

Close enough?

>Haruno's relationship with Yui is fine, and she doesn't belittle Hayato and Hachiman. You call her an edgelord, I call her a mischievous little shit.

Yea Haruno is not too toxic to Yui I agree. You're flat out delusional if you say she doesn't belittle Hayato and Hachiman though. The first time it's shown that she and Hayato know each other personally was in that episode where Haruno and Hachiman are at a cafe together. It's late in the evening and Haruno just straight up commands Hayato to arrive immediately for her own amusement. But wait, she tells Hachiman that Hayato doesn't even amuse her, that he bores her basically because he's not a delinquent. She also belittles Hachiman all the time by being incessantly and utterly patronizing in every single interaction with him, not to mention making a veiled threat at him for going ""boring"" on her that one time in season 2 (can't remember the episode). I can't even see a possible discussion on this point except on the term belittling. Perhaps condescending or patronizing fits better? Depending on how you define each of those terms. You get the general idea though.

>I guess the entire cast of K-On! are disrespectful assholes then.

Haven't watched it, can't comment.

>It's understandable why Hayato would be like that because Hachiman acted like a prick to get the information from him and end things quickly, just like he did on some other occasions. Plus, he was stressed out from the events prior. Cut him some slack.

I never once called Hayato an edgelord though. He was certainly displaying edgy behavior here however. That's not an issue by itself, it's just that there's already so much edginess in the series, Hayato adding more is really not helping. But I don't need to cut Hayato slack because I don't consider his character in general to be an edgelord in the first place.

>No. I just don't think these guys qualify as edgelords at all.

Then what is an edgelord to you?

"> I've put hundreds of hours into CSGO. But it seems like every game has someone with a wallhack and every second or third game has an aimbotter (which their own team happily ignore because it gives them an edge, in spite of them knowing full well). Spin botters are rare fortunately, and get kicked because even their team cannot fake ignorance.

I think this more closely highlights the issue within the CS:GO community, NOT that cheating is rampant, but because SO many people are SO quick to just assume cheats. I have 1,800 hours in CS:GO and I have played everywhere from Nova 1 to SMFC. There were periods of time in which cheating was an every other game occurence at specific ranks, but at no point in CS:GO's lifetime has cheating ever been as rampant as you claim it to be. Not to sound condescending, but if you honestly think that every game has a wallhacker and every second or third game has an aimbotter (of which I have encountered, maybe, twenty in 1,800 hours), then perhaps you should start watching demos of your games to see how you might have simply been outplayed. There's so much people don't take into account when they think they're hidden, be it shadows, gun models, or otherwise. 

Not to mention, spinbotters are less than rare; they're practically nonexistent since Valve instituted some new back-end coding that all but prohibits that type of cheat from being successful. I haven't personally seen one since that update. "

That's a flawed analogy because you're applying value judgements with 'right' and 'wrong'.

Of course in your situation that would be unacceptable.

A better comparison would be: A black teenager gets attacked while walking through a park.

The police release a statement that black teenagers should exercise caution while walking through that park, or avoid it for the time being, if possible.

Maybe the attacker is targeting black teens. Maybe the attacker IS a black teen (which would take a lot of the Oomph out of your original scenario). Until the police can get more leads or make an arrest, they advise people to be careful. Is that racist? What if the next day another black teen is attacked, then another, then another? Now there's a serial attacker who is clearly targeting black teens. Is it still racist to tell black teens to avoid that park? Or is it age-ist to tell black teens to avoid it, but black retirees are probably okay?

What if the next day a white teen is attacked? Then a Japanese 30 year old? Then an unsupervised 10 year old? Then the police release a statement advising all men to avoid that park. Is that still condescending and sexist? When the attacker is clearly targeting men?

Or if they just attack randomly? All ages, races, genders? So the police just tell everyone to avoid that park at night. Is that still patronising? They're saying the exact same thing, they've just expanded it to include everyone, rather than just women or men or black teenagers.

>the only acceptable outcome is that people should not feel in danger regardless of where they go.
That is a fantasy land. There will always be danger in human society. There will always be people with violent mental illnesses who can't control themselves or people hopped up on drugs/alcohol or sadists who just enjoy hurting people.

-The pope refered to the genocide as ""regrettable."" Blowing your money at the casino is regrettable. Herpes is regrettable. It doesn't really work for genocide. However for the record, I used to be a member of the Anglican church until this came to light, however the Anglican church has only done this a couple times, and the British empire has a shining human rights record as far as world controlling dominions go, whereas Catholicism has the thousand year history of wiping people out. And with the history of the Anglican church as a contradiction of the Vatican etc.

>No wonder, then, that Catholic priests, part of the largest non-governmental provider of education in the world, would also participate.

WHAT. There is Christian schools all over the first world providing inferior education, and by that I mean as inferior as they can make it without violating government regulation, to children with idiotic (read religious) parents. Those schools are literally DETRIMENTAL to the education of the children because providing them with accurate understanding of the material (history and science) would completely undermine the entire purpose of establishing separate schools: to create unquestioning members of the church.

>Your statement is factually correct, much like saying the Black Death ultimately helped because it immunized Europeans to the plague.

The black death did a whole lot more than that. A whole lot more good.

>I'll assume you're talking about the Crusades.

Crusades, 30 years war, conquistadors, a bunch of other conflicts not included in my above average general understanding of history. The Vatican had the ability to prevent or at least condemn innumerable wars, or rather genocides, but the people they kicked out were those who disagreed with them. According to the Catholic church: Genocide in the name of God = Fine, Righteousness in the name of anything that isn't God = Bad.

>World War Two did that. Not the Nazis. World War Two would've done that whether it was started by Germany or Japan or the Soviet Union or Turkey or Portugal or Monaco.

Bullshit. The only people capable of pulling off something like that was Germany. The Japanese couldnt of done shit unless the Americans were committing resources in Europe. The only reason Turkey has indepence is because Britain was committing the majority of it's resources in Europe in the first world war. The Portuguese are dumbasses by W. European standards; their even exceeded in most respects by former Soviet blocs. former soviet blocs.\



>What historical event are you talking about? Please don't take this as a rhetorical question, I sincerely want to know, I haven't heard about this.

AKA the dark ages.

>Also, the religion of the head of a country is not the religion of a country. The US was not a Catholic country from 1961 to 1963.

No shit; but the head of a country gets elected based on the importance of religion to that country. The United States elected a Catholic president because they had become tolerant enough to elect a non-protestant, but they're still not tolerant enough to elect a non-Christian. The point is invalid.

>Are you saying that the Catholic Church should put its money where its mouth is? Because it has.

They don't have enough money to put their money where their mouth is. It would take like $75 trillion per annum charity for the 1 billion condescendingly rightcheous Catholics to put their money where their mouths are. Unfortunately there isn't that much money.

>Yes, it's quite similar to the relationship between Protestants and Catholics. I don't see your point.

Yeah but they're not slaughtering each other anymore. Now it's more of a mild contempt; at least they're identifying with people of Abrahamic faith and aligning themselves against athiests and pagans and whatever. I don't approve but it's not completely retarded. See previous about 30 years war. Also protestantism isn't centerally governed so various protestant

Blacks have a higher rate of incarceration than any other race in the United States, by a recognizable margin. I'm not gonna argue the black point because reasons.

However the Jew point I can argue, because Jews aren't idiots and talking about them doesn't make me racist. Jews have earned distrust from cacausians because they're the only race notably smarter than whites. There was a description in The Time Traveller by Wells which I can't remember in verbatim but it was about how this inventor was smart enough to be suspect without evidence of such. White people are smarter than most other races; you can deny it all you want but it's clear. I'm noticably smarter than the average white, you can deny it etc. But as smart as I am I'm only about as smart as the average Jew. The average. Jews are crazy fucking smart, at least the Ashkenazis are. Ashkenazis are short, white, and got names like Joe Sheckelberg, Einstien, Mark Zuckerberg, Jon Steward, or Freud. Israelis are kinda dumb tho.

"> If you give half a shit about animals, like many vegetarians proclaim they do, you would stop financing these companies.

Speaking as someone recently convinced by anti-dairy and egg industry arguments and currently making the transition from vegetarian to vegan: do you seriously not understand just how counterproductive abrasive crap like this is? Someone who is vegetarian for ethical reasons agrees with the basic idea that non-human animals are relevant objects for moral reasoning. That is about 80% of the process, with the remaining 20% being a mix of acknowledging the reality of the dairy and egg industries and having the willpower to do the most good possible. Here, you had someone who sincerely, politely asked for an explanation about how eggs and dairy indirectly support animal slaughter. You had an opportunity to simply and gently present the facts, and maybe help them get some of that last 20% of the way there—and instead you opted to make an ass out of yourself and throw shade on the sincerity ethical vegetarians' convictions about animal welfare. They do not ""proclaim"" to give a shit about animals, they do give a shit—and the sooner you recognize that they are not simply incomplete vegans but rather caring people in their own right with whom you probably share some very fundamental views about morality, you might just see how many come around to your way of thinking with a bit more education. As it is, you may have just validated someone's stereotype of vegans as condescending dicks more interested in belittling than dialoguing and, in doing so, locked them in firmly at 80% for a while longer."

the fact that she reeks of hereditary rule also runs against her, especially since everyone still has a bad GWB taste in their mouth.

And in a lot of cases, people will be more interested in the debate you started with them then with their previous misconceptions of what Objectivism is.

">The philosophy is that the benefit of labor should be given to the one doing the labor.

According to your definition of socialist ""philosophy"", there should be no conflict between capitalism and socialism. Under capitalism, laborers are compensated for their work. The agree to the amount of compensation they receive. 

If that is in fact your case, I have no argument. As I said in my previous post, I have absolutely no objection to worker-owned businesses. 

>As a side note, you are jumping into a rather unfair argument as a philosophy never needs to prove that it works

No, but science does. Economics is a science. Most of my arguments concerning capitalism and socialism are economical in nature. 

>You have the right in this case, however, I have the same right and exercise it far more liberally than you do and with far more people than you can muster. I see we will circle this one a lot but I will repeat myself, might makes right.

No. Might gives you power, not any kind of moral right. There is a difference. My response to such a situation would be cliche': Give me liberty, or give me death. 

>I have 20 armed people who believe taking everything from you is right and believe you can defend yourself from us. You are one person. You are dead. We are all now slightly richer.

I'm going to go ahead and assume you don't have as much experience with warfare as I do. First off, you will already be at a negative value after arming and taking the time to organize your crew of 20. Secondly, you have no idea how many resources I have or how much I have invested in defense. Are you ready to compensate any individuals' families when I kill them during your assault? What if I don't have enough to take to even make the assault worthwhile? What about blowback? What will you do when surrounding communities see me as a martyr and rise up against your crew of 20? For all your effort you may not only end up not profiting, but also may end up dead. 

I said it before and I'll say it again: the idea that ""might makes right"" is juvenile. If might made right we would be done in the Middle East. Superior numbers and equipment does not always translate to victory. In fact, it is unsustainable without a government-backed monetary system. You understand that armies themselves are socialist institutions, right? Even by your own definition. 

>I agree completely, which is why I disregard your opinions and morals. Oh, wait, that kills your main argument about self-ownership again as your morals are contradicting my morals here. 

... What? I must have missed the part where you explain why I'm a violent sociopath. 

>I thought you were going for a system where a group aids another group, not an indefinite measuring stick that I was already arguing against with self-ownership.

I also must have missed where you made an argument against self-ownership. 

>You can scream right up until the 20 people kick your ass and take your things that they shouldn't use coercion, doesn't change that their action was a gain for them and there was no real penalty for them doing so.

And socialism would be a solution to this problem how, exactly? I have no idea what the point you are trying to make is. 

>Again, I never said it did require a government, only pointed out it acted a lot like one. 

You certainly didn't explain how it acted like one. A group of people working together isn't a government. One characteristic of government is that it claims special rights not reserved for the rest of the populace. 

>If I have 20 people who say I am right and you have 5 that say you are right, I am right.

Just like when everyone thought the world was flat? Popular consensus does not make something right. 

>Just like today, where if over half the nation votes for trump and less than half votes for the dem then the trump crowd the trump crowd is right

So what happens when the majority of Americans don't vote? Just like in the last few elections... 

>Everything is limited by access and availability.

Indeed, and the goal of capitalism is to end scarcity. Let's be clear here: you said the basis of socialism was that resources are finite. I demonstrated how that was wrong. 

>You can say capitalism will lead you new ventures but socialism does say this will happen when resources are all used at capacity so no real difference there.

One is proactive, while the other is reactionary. I'd rather get us into space before we use up our planet's resources. 

>If you say a person is being compensated for the labor but another person decides what portion of their labor they get you are creating slaves! Slavery is bad! 

Indeed! That would be slavery! Unfortunately, employees accept the terms of employment before they start to work. Slavery, by definition, isn't voluntary. 

Aside from the fact that my argument wasn't a straw-man, perhaps you could supply a better one yourself. 

>you argue on the grounds that a person can own the resource which is outside the philosophy argued and again moving into the economic socialist ideology.

What are you saying here? Does you philosophy address ownership, or doesn't it? 

>So, congratulations on a nested straw man argument

Do you even know what a straw-man argument is? A hypothetical situation isn't automatically a straw-man. 

>Seriously though, can you argue that the more a person works on a resource the more they should earn?

No, I thought that was your argument. To be honest, I'm kind of surprised. It seemed like your first response was concise and to the point... everything I'm reading now is a mish-mash of half-completed thoughts and random diatribes. 

>at the end of the day if I put in 2 hours and you put in 4 hours of the exact same work that produces the exact same value you should earn more.

If you can do the same work I do but in half the time, you should get paid more. Let me say this again: value is subjective. If your better at negotiating your contract than I am, you deserve what you get. 

>That would take a great deal more than an hour of your time and a great deal more resources than you could earn on your own.

Precisely why I would have taken out a loan and hired people to help me. Still, who shoulders all the risk? Me. 

>You are again injecting economics into an argument on philosophy.

Probably because we're talking about socialism- a social and economic ideology. I don't know how to put this without being too condescending, but sociology is NOT a fucking philosophy. 

>Also, you are not using equal footing as a starting point, you are assuming one worker has more ability to do work and produce than another.

Because that is reality. No two people are the same. Furthermore, if one person took out the loan and the other did not, they are not on equal footing. 

>Communism mike drop

How old are you? 

>As for the straw man...err...babysitter argument

Okay, so you do think every hypothetical is a straw-man. 

""you are arguing that anybody can own a baby and the baby has no self ownership! sorry, nested straw man number three.""

Did I say ownership? No, I didn't. Still, guardianship applies. Do you have children? A baby is not exactly capable of claiming their right to self-ownership. 

>the babysitter owns their labor, not the resource.

So, you're agreeing with me? 

>Any other babysitter can be hired for the same labor on the same resource and the one who works the best or is the cheapest would get the work.

Like capitalism? Now I'm thoroughly confused. 

>If you stuck 10 people on an island and one person claimed everything on the island was theirs so the other 9 have to work on the island, the other 9 would ignore the claim as it is baseless.

In your opinion it's baseless. To the person that believes they have a claim, it is their property. Ownership is a personal construct, not a social construct. What if that single individual has been working on the island and the other 9 didn't want to participate until they noticed what he had build had value? 

>Philosophic Socialism is only that the same labor should have the same value.

Alright. So, according to this philosophy, what would happen if two different individuals voluntarily decided to work for different amounts of compensation? Would you force them to work for the same amount? 

>Assuming no ownership of resources, as is the Philosophy

No ownership of any resources? Does that mean it would be okay for me to piss in someone's well? 

>you would be talking about land

Okay, then let's adjust. I'm actually open to the option of homesteading unused land, so we may actually agree a bit on that issue. So how about we change this to a cleaning maid in a house? 

>in which case mowing would have no value 

What? If no one valued the yard being mowed, why would it be done in the first place? I'll say it again: value is subjective. You don't get to decide what does or does not have value for other people. 

>and not be a valued labor unless pest control was involved.

...What?

>We are talking about the same labor for different amounts of time.

No, we are discussing what right you have to dictate how others agree to be paid. With value being subjective, you can't see past a person's decision to work for any amount other than what you think they should be paid. 

>I could call this another fallacy but I grew exhausted slaying the evil straw men.

Please, do everyone a favor and look at a list of logical fallacies. 

>The philosophy is that people working together are more productive. You don't believe businesses are places where people work together?

Of course they are. That was my point. What difference does it make whether the company is private or collectively owned? 

>the Socialism we have been discussing has been a philosophy.

- Same labor should have the same value. 

- Argues that ownership is a social construct.

- Resources are finite

"Psychological projection. Look it up.

Nah man, I was telling someone that their conduct was inappropriate, and it was. If you're so high on your own fatuousness that you don't see inappropriate sexualization of public discourse as itself stigmatizing, then you need to work on your empathy: for a lot of people, having to talk about a stranger's kinks makes the conversation unsafe for them, and it's not because they're prudish or unenlightened or otherwise in need of a condescending lecture, it's because that's a rational human reaction to an ordinary conversation suddenly turning unnecessarily sexual.

"

>So, you make one up. Got it.

Though this statement reads as condescending, it does hold with it much truth. Does not all the weight of reason rest upon its shoulders? Everything we understand as truth remains in fact ""made up"". Certainly there exists a body of reasonable, observable, evidence and experimentation to support those concepts which we hold to be true, but at a conceptual level, all understanding could be wrong. Take mathematics for example. Modern mathematics as we understand it today finds its foundation on a set of axioms known as Zermelo-Faenkel Choice or ZFC. The C part of this axiom system remains under debate, however there are huge bodies of reasoning and extrapolation from these rules which were in fact ""made up"" in the last 100 years. By nature they cannot be proven. However they are a best fit for constructing the whole of mathematics. Should I then, since these ideas are simply the creations of some mens imagination, toss them aside flippantly and believe in stead that all of mathematics is in fact the work of faeries? 

As for your hard evidence [the natural response to what I just said about math remains to ask for the supporting observable experiments and extrapolation], I suppose I have none. I can only conclude that that my life is better as a believer than as not, and that my religion is an unreasonable crutch. Unless you count a bevy of abstract notions about love and relationships and humanity, but you probably do not.

"> That wasn't lost on me, that is exactly what I was talking about...

Fair enough. I retract the condescending first paragraph then.

> Granted, I ignored the possibility of economic growth, but in my experience inflation is the likely result. At least, that's what happened with all 5 of the minimum wage increases that have happened since I've been working. Its nice to hope it will be different, but it would be better to find a replacement system that would work regardless of how employers reacted to it.

In some fast Google image searching for useful charts, here's minimum wage since the late 1930s -- we probably wanna stick with nominal dollars for the sake of this discussion, since it wouldn't make too much sense to compare inflation to something that's adjusted for inflation -- and here's year-to-year change of the core CPI, the main measure of inflation.

The relationship is pretty tenuous, and certainly the spikes in inflation have better explanations than changes in the federal minimum wage. The spikes in the 70s were due to oil supply shocks. I can't speak to the little spike during the HW Bush administration -- maybe that one had something to do with minimum wage? -- but I'd bet the little bump around Y2K had something to do with a certain equities bubble and Greenspan's response. And of course there was a Bush recession jump (in 2003 or so) that does not have a corresponding signal in historical minimum wage."
"> Yes, but the whole point of the strategy is that apparently the Repub's rules are NOT entirely democratic.

You could argue that the whole US voting system is not democratic, being based on the electoral college and all. The bottom line is that the Founding Fathers didn't trust the people to be smart enough to vote directly, so they inserted an indirection to vote on their behalf.

I used to think this was an extremely condescending and callous decision, but when I see how many people support Santorum, I'm beginning to think that the Founding Fathers were mystifyingly prescient.

People, on the other hand, as a group, do. Being a condescending asshole must feel great to some people, because I never see the actual benefit in it, other than getting your opponents to double down just to spite you (which of course, in turn, does nothing to advance your point of view)."
">On a side note, the couple of things I didn't like about V5 came from changes that appeared to be reactionary to fans. I say ""appeared"" because we really can't know what went on behind the scenes, we can only guess.

Honestly, that's one of my problems with the writing as well. The writers are so reactionary to fans. Listening to complaints and feedback is fine and all, but when you're reacting to pretty much everything and what is written is a direct result of that, it makes me wonder if the writers even have an overarching plan at all written down.

As much as I want the writers to listen to my complaints, I would've respected them more if they put their foot down and say ""We have a plan. Trust us."" and then backing up that claim with a well-written and well-executed storyline that most of us could enjoy without it being divisive.

Especially when I'm seeing conservatives being super disingenuous in their arguments about this.

>Plus, who decides who gets to be considered an expert in the first place?

That does not have to be more difficult than it has to be. We simply use the established paradigm to decide who is an expert (i.e. Ph.d.'s or whatever) and then let them decide what is an expert in their field. It's not about having specifies opinion but having certain factual knowledge in the field. 

>If the wrong people somehow ended up in power that could go very very wrong.

I dont see any point in lecturing me of the ""realities"" of the two party system if you aren't trying to convince me to vote democrat. That's how this spiel normally works. 

>2016 is not a party realignment. In a party realignment a party dies and is replaced, or undergoes such extreme transformation that it breaks with it's previous traditions, thus leading to a large flux in the balance of power between the parties. The democratic party moved slightly left on various issues. That is not party realignment. 

I never said it was. But sometimes party realignments don't happen in a day. Take, for example, the previous one, where the tipping point was in 1980 and we actually had events leading up to it all through the 60s and 70s. 

I would argue we started seeing things fall apart in 2008ish, with the bush administration being so hated, and obama being elected on a mandate of hope and change. We are not at the tipping point yet, but we are getting there. I expect the actual tipping point to likely be some time in the 2020s. 

Reagan marked a pretty stark break in tradition with the nixon and eisenhower administrations. And Clinton (1992) represented a huge shift away from new deal era politics. We are starting to see tensions arise within the parties due to the current alignment, and I think 2016 was a year of a lot of division forming within the parties. The republican party has been melting down ideologically since the obama administration, and i think the dems are ultimately going to go through a similar process. 

The best outcome of this realignment if you ask me is progressives taking over the democrats, establishing a commanding narrative that sets the course of politics for the next few decades, and the republicans end up moderating as their numbers fall apart.

>Not only that but what lost Clinton the election was about a dozen different things. Voter apathy, Trump's successful appeal to white America, electoral college and so on and so forth. The democratic party has a lot to look at, and I'm sure they'll find they don't need to politically realign just to win again. Hell Trump is the best democratic recruitment drive since Nixon. 

And carter was a great republican recruitment drive. And hoover was a good democratic one.

Sometimes really crappy presidents from the opposition party are what triggers the dramatic shifts I speak of. The real question is whether the democrats will sieze the moment and put forward a commanding narrative that changes the balance of power in washington or if they'll sit on their hands and settle for the same defeatism the ""new democrats"" have been forcing on us for decades.

As for why the democrats lost...I primarily put it on the clintons and their message. They had none. It was ""vote for me or else"". Her appeal to white america as you put it was ""vote for me or you're racist"". She offered NOTHING to many people. people want ANSWERS to perceived problems, and clinton was the candidate of everything is fine, now shut the up and vote for me or else. 

About the electoral college though....Clinton, by all rights, should've won that. The electoral college I would argue actually leans more left than the popular vote. The blue wall in the rust belt is supposed to be unstoppable. But again, Clinton offered these guys nothing, and actually angered many of them. And when you dont have a candidate on the left with answers, people will buy into trump's populism instead.

Again, this is completely and totally a clinton failure to appeal to people. 

The reason obama won so well was he was seen as the champion of the little guy. The working class was decimated by the recession in a lot of ways and many people like OP were waking up and realizing the republicans are actually terrible. I was one of those republican defectors. But you know, you can't really appeal to the people as a democrat unless you make true on your words and stand up for the little guy. And that's what bernie sanders had clinton didnt. Clinton was just as out of touch with people in a lot of ways as romney was in 2012. And even worse the party was in this state of groupthink where they shot themselves in the foot and disrespected some of their strongest supporters by condescending to us and telling us our ideas were fairy dust and unicorns. 

>If any party is even close to realigning it's the Republican party, they're split between the Trump radicals and the moderates that are more like Kasich. They also have to battle the fact that less than 20% of their votes come from minorities in an increasingly diverse country. If they don't take steps to expand their base they'll become effectively powerless nationally within 30 years.

And the democrats are splitting between the clinton and sanders factions. 

>Now for the words you put in my mouth. It's not defeatism to acknowledge the fact that our voting system actively leads to two party systems. It's also not defeatism to acknowledge that the party that most Americans voted for will not be undergoing party realignment. Party realignment is a drastic change. Third party voting won't start that. Third party voting can, not necessarily will, lead to a party modifying their platform.

It is defeatism to tell us to vote with our fears and out of opposition for the other guys and not for our highest ideals.

Youre missing the big picture. The republicans are mostly held together by antipathy for the democrats, gerrymandering, and voter suppression. Their demographics are aging and they're increasingly out of touch with reality. All you need is some really bad republican presidents like trump to shake enough people out of their illusory world and realize these guys actually suck. They have nothing. They're way weaker than you think they are. The problem is the democrats arent utilizing the silent majority well enough to actually boot them out for good.

>Yes the government is accountable to us, but as political studies have shown our winner takes all system leads to two party systems where various situations lead to people voting for candidates they hate less than the other candidate, rather than one they like. 

And as political science also teaches, this leads to frequent coalition changes every few decades as the status quo becomes increasingly divorced with the ideas of every day americans. 

It took a MASSIVE propaganda campaign just to keep the american people in line here. And as long as we stop buying their BS, which si what im advocating for, the shift will happen. Just look at how young people feel about the republicans. They dont have much of a future given their voter base is aging and dying off. 

>And also I hate to break it to you, the government already barely works for us. The amount of money you have is a direct indicator of how likely you are to see reforms you want passed. It takes overwhelming public support from poorer people in order to get their way. That rarely happens so they rarely get their way. The rich on the other hand get their way frequently. 

Which is all the more reason for us poor people (and many young millennials are poor) to band together and force the parties to change. 

We're having the same debates now we had in the 1970s during the last realignment. Remember carter's crisis of confidence speech? Oh so relevant today. We're at that time where tensions are rising and the only healthy way to alleviate them is for the parties to change.

>Short of that your vote won't effect much besides your morality unfortunately. 

It's what needs to be done. If the dems wont change from within we must put external pressure on them. The thing is, we tried it from within. We ran BERNIE FREAKING SANDERS and saw the machinery crush him like a bug, and we're learning all about how the democrats are a graveyard of progressive movements. As such, my ultimatum is if they want my support they'll support my agenda. 

>Short of going out and organizing massive sweeping political movements Duverger's Law tells us the two party system will lock people into voting for candidate (Democrat in the case of left leaning people) they think has a shot at beating the one they hate more.

Only if you buy into democratic propaganda which is sounding more and more like stockholm syndrome.

>And ""Bernie or bust"" is strange to me considering Bernie endorsed Clinton and actively worked with the democratic party to help incorporate parts of his platform. That's the goal right? The primaries got Clinton to pick up parts of free college, single payer rhetoric, and so on, yet that's not enough? I'm not a fan of the democratic party myself and yet even I thought that was pretty good for a single primary run.

Bernie is too nice and civil to turn on the democrats. And as a rational actor if he did he would be attacked by the dems and his movement sabotaged. However, we the people, the citizenry, who know what's going on, are free to do as we wish. he might have to get in front of crowds and tell us to vote for clinton, but it wont work. because bernie isnt our leader in the sense we will follow him off a clinton. He merely represents our ideals in a way clinton and the rest of the dems don't.

Also, the democrats are only taking up those platforms to the smallest extent they have to. The democrats have killed many single payer initiatives on the state level. They'll put on a nice face and act like they care about it but when they think no one is looking they'll sabotage those same efforts. As it is, the dems are controlled opposition for the elite class. They move left just enough to satiate the populace but no further. "

Just to clarify, I don't mean to come across as condescending or holier-than-thou or anything of the sort. 

>I just think that you're overlooking the fact that you will now always be shifting attributes, as there's no reason not to.

I don't agree. Mana was never a limiting factor for Morphing before (unless you're against a mana burn hero such as AM, in which case you've probably already lost the game). If anything, I think it's more limiting now since his int has been heavily reduced. This means you can be much less aggressive in lane, especially in mid lane (but it also applies to safelane Morph), which is where I loved to play Morph a few patches ago (Mid Morph only works when the lineup is right, and the meta hasn't been good for it for some time now.). 

In regards to shifting attributes, you only need to do that when absolutely necessary. A good Morphling will stay as low on strength (and therefore health) while remaining alive. This gives you the most right click and nuke damage, as well as a lot of armor. The challenge becomes staying alive and knowing when to shift, and when to stop. Very rarely did I run out of mana during a fight unless they had manaburn of some sort, or unless I was very low going into a fight. Silences, nukes and AA are the real enemies of Morphling. Manaburn used to be a concern but honestly versus a support Morph I don't think manaburn even does much in regards to winning the game."

">It was not seen in a positive light.

Yeah, it's not. At least, it's not by feminists.

>Do you have any links to substantiate your definition versus the ones I found?

From the top of the google search:

>Benevolent sexism is a chivalrous attitude toward women that feels favorable but is actually sexist because it casts women as weak creatures in need of men's protection.

From an abstract on Psychology of Women Quarterly:

>Benevolent sexism encompasses subjectively positive (for the sexist) attitudes toward women in traditional roles: protective paternalism, idealization of women, and desire for intimate relations.

Those are two. The theme of ""chivalry"" and ""protect and provide"" and ""gender roles"", etc., seems to be common in most of the research I've done.

>I do this every day as well. There's nothing sexist about it IMO.

Um, yes there absolutely is, according to feminists and those fighting against sexism.

>Are you really complaining because women are mean to you?

No, I'm not complaining that women are mean to me. I'm complaining that they are sexist towards me.

Do you think that a woman complaining of being treated in a sexist manner is really just complaining because someone was ""mean"" to her?

>None of that means you need to be a sexist, however.

I'm not employing a ""women did it first"" argument. My concern is that sexism towards women, even the kind of sexism that (at least arguably) benefits women, is seen as men either maliciously or obliviously attempting to subjugate and oppress women while reinforcing the patriarchy and their traditional gender role, all against the wishes of women, while no attention at all is paid to the fact that women can and often do treat men in an equally sexist manner. 

I'm not a sexist because women are sexist towards me. I'm a sexist because I see women and men as different, and, as such, wanting and operating and responding to different things accordingly, and I'm sexist because women seem to like me much more when I fulfill the ""masculine/chivalrous/protector and provider"" traditional gender role (in both sexual and platonic relationships), and lose respect for me when I act contrary to that role. 

And it's not like my wife and female friends are some retrograde country bumpkins who go to church and want to live in the 50s - they are, almost to a woman, highly-educated independent progressive urban liberal career women who, on the surface, eschew notions of ""gender roles"" and what not, but still highly reward strong masculine men who make them feel safe and taken care of, and bitch (a lot) about guys who do not make them feel that way.

>I said I call them out for that every time I see it.

You must be busy calling out all the sexists all the time, since sexism is so pervasive.

Where were you when I was struggling as a SAHD and having to take my son to ""mom's groups"" or ""Mommy and Me"" events or ""motherhood"" classes or other such bastions of blatant sexism.

And look, I don't even care that much that such things (among many examples) are incredibly sexist and make someone like me feel unwelcome and marginalized, what with all the condescending and womansplaining going on, at least from those women for whom my very presence didn't make them too uncomfortable to interact. I'm a big boy, I'm tough, I rather enjoyed taking them on. 

But it's just beyond the pale that the women who are constantly lambasting men for so much sexism and so much offensiveness fail to recognize just how much they are guilty of the same. But of course women feel no need for such introspection, given that they are ""oppressed"" and men are ""privileged"", so men are the one's that need to stop fostering a sexist society.

">I agree with pretty much everything you're saying. But then why not just call for Dawkins to publish his work for peer review in history, sociology or philosophy?

Dawkins has a right to express his beliefs. It would be silly for me to attack his work on the grounds of being unscientific. It would be easier to come to terms with the idea that, despite being written by a scientist, The God Delusion is basically an evangelical piece. 

>Why bully him into debating another guy who himself is not an accomplished academic in history, sociology or philosophy?

I think Craig is perfectly qualified to speak within the confines of theology. In short, Dawkins has not only stepped into this turf, but he's also lowered his arguments to personalized attacks on his caricature of God through direct quotations of scripture. As a man standing on his academic merits (though making very unacademic arguments), I think it's prudent that he should debate an expert on the topic. I think the experience might be a character-builder for the man.

>If anything, it will just reinforce the notion that ideas are evaluated by having dilettantes do battle on stage. That's the last thing we need.

I think people need to see debates more than you accept, in general. We are outside of the realm of scientific realities, though. Dawkins has made and unscientific yet strong and aggressive argument in his works and I feel his condescending dabbles in theology have justified this call for debate. It would be a different situation if he was defending science in a debate form, but he's merely defending his own views. It's in his right to decline to debate, but I feel it will reflect poorly on his character-- and that's from a general perspective. "
"> My conclusion is that your position as outlined is a post-hoc rationalisation for the rejection of religion on other grounds (about which I will not speculate) because, despite your confidence and certitude (and condescension) the rational warrant simply isn’t there.

I realize some of my language might feel condescending, but when it comes to claims about accepting claims or evidence, a stance must be taken, and I have to admit with sincerity when I say I find no theistic argument compelling. That's not to demean anyone, I just think the flaw is in the missed assumptions (hence the shoebox challenge) and not in the logic (all the time, anyway) itself. Either way, this was not meant to be some sort of ""I've got some winning trickster card in my back pocket"" challenge. I just thought the shoebox was a completely reasonable place where any side of the argument can start on level ground. Do you disagree (even if we remove the science bit)? 

> The idea that “most of science” can be included among the set of basic assumptions from which we will operate in looking at the proposition that God exists is presuppositional. It is also facile and unwarranted.

Most of science being the scientific principles? It was done as a favor more than a requirement to the challenge. By all means, let's just start with the basic assumptions 1) that you and I both exist 2) that we're living in the real world 3) that our perceptions, while fallible in reflecting this world, are our best source for gleaning anything 4) logic is the means by which we derive further truth. I mean, what's unreasonable about these? Isn't this the default position of a reasonable human? I added science since it is a logical development of vetted and falsifiable claims of the universe which provides additional information by which we can learn about our world, but it's not necessary for basic assumptions. I'm happy to throw it out if you'd like to present a case for God without it. 

> Remembering that your shoebox contains the set of basic assumptions and evidence from which we will proceed to a conclusion, I am left with the creeping suspicion that I will be wasting my keystrokes by debating you.

Why? Isn't this basically the default conditions basically everyone starts in? Nothing in the shoebox has ruled out the possibility of anything, and all explanations are equally viable until ruled out with reasonable certainty. 

> Seriously, dude. What the hell are you talking about? That we must prove our conclusion before adding it to the set of working assumptions

Yes...well, sort of. ""Prove"" is a hard word. I would accept reasonable evidence in absence of the possibility of a hard-proof. But otherwise, yeah. If I told you that I demanded as part of the assumptions that God didn't exist, you'd have to admit this as a waste of time, because any possible explanation you'd provide would be trumped by the fact that we're working under a set of rules that forbid it. Similarly, adding God in ad hoc defeats any possibility of having an honest debate about his/her/its existence, because it's added without warrant and obviously can become vacuously true if all else fails. We have to start on common ground. 

Now this doesn't mean you have to do it in one fell swoop (which I think we both agree would be hard if not impossible), but if you built out the underlying assumptions that supported the claim first and added them to the box, the logical step would be much smaller. 

> Listen, if you want to be an atheist, you are free to do so. God himself has vouchsafed you the freedom to reject him. But don’t try to pass off the exercise of your moral and spiritual freedom to reject God as a necessary and therefore unavoidable outcome of a cogent line of reasoning

You may think believing is a choice, but if so that depends on a notion of faith that betrays any credibility to being reasonable. If to you choosing God is a matter of accepting prior statements tacked on without warrant, that's fine, but I cannot choose to believe that which is not reasonably explained. 

> when it is manifestly obvious to me that your “cogent line of reasoning” is neither cogent nor a line nor reasoning.

I think taking the default position (the items that I have listed in the shoebox) are cogent enough. I think it unfair that you denounce my line of reasoning without exploring it in any detail. If you are telling me that it is impossible to get from the shoebox to a logical conclusion that there is likely a God and it is likely the Christian God, which line of reasoning is more flawed? In any case, this was never about winning, it's about understanding the truth. Should it be so obvious that I am simply ignoring an obvious line of reasoning, I invite you to reveal it to me. I'm not in the business of maintaining a stance for pride's sake. I've changed positions before when I found the evidence to be compelling, I'm happy to do so again.

And I am happy to engage on your terms, but no progress can be made unless you provide a set of assumptions we can both agree on.

So no we are not ""not committed"" to SK's defense as you falsely imply. We have a formal legal treaty with South Korea in which we provide military defense to SK. In fact we are still technically at war with North Korea with a cease fire signed in 1953.

> Moreover, what Kim got was 1) legitimization from the US, and 2) an agreement by the US to denuclearize our own forces in Korea.

North Korea has always been since 1945 a legitimate country no different than South Korea or Japan or any country. They have never been disputed to be a country as you yet again wrongfully declared.

Wrong, the US never agreed for the US to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula, don't know where you got that crazy idea, besides we already have ICBMs that can reach North Korea and be fired from US soil so your point is also mute.

So to correct your wrong points, the legitimate leader of NK makes nukes, we create a draft agreement for NK to peacefully give up its nukes and ICBMs and if successful all sanctions and the threat of military intervention by the US will go away.

"> the “you’ll understand when you’re a mother” scene

One of the parts that annoyed me the most was when she is reporting the missing children to security, they ask her how old they are, and she doesn't know exactly. Chris Pratt asks her ""you don't know how old your nephews are?"" in the most condescending and reproachful tone possible. 

The movie famously went through many rewrites, and I'm sure in an early draft she was the mother of the two boys. This scene wouldn't really be better, because it would still be part of the ""women should put family before career"" message, but at least Pratt's reaction would make a bit more sense and would be understandable.

">Is the problem the religion or the comunity?

So as far as this goes, it is both. Christianity has the bible. The bible is two parts. Old testament is full of hate, and strange rules, and violence. The new testament is full of love and redemption. Christians are supposed to follow the new testament, but whenever it suits them, they lean back on the old testament to push hate or agendas. So, it is both. As you said, ""people need some strong ""cause"" to feel they exist. Moreover it gives them free and easy explanation about this big frightening world they don't understand"". If you give someone searching for an answer a giant ancient book of violence and fables and tell them that it is the way to salvation... who knows what parts they will take to heart. So far we figured out that shrimp and polyester is cool, but gay people are not. Also... they ignore all the slave, rape and different marriage rules that are laid out in the old testament.

>So what is your 'ennemy'? Religion or a community of lobbyists

To me, organized religion is an identifiable enemy. At best it fills empty people with false hope. At worst, it takes away rights from everyone, imposes rules based on century old philosophies that most do not prescribe to. Not to mention the fleecing of ignorant people of Billions of dollars through mega churches and TV evangelists. The damage that organized religion has done to humanity far exceeds any of the positives.

">Last, but not least, there’s a danger in seeing girlhood as a permanent stain on one’s soul, something that damages a person irrevocably. Set aside the fact that there are such vast differences between cultures that it hardly makes sense to speak of “being raised female” as if it were a single thing. It dims the prospects for adult women to see these formative experiences as permanently crippling. If a trans woman who spends 20 years being perceived as a man and 60 years being perceived as a woman can’t be said to have experienced what it’s like to be a woman, then this means that early experiences of sexism are the most important fact of a woman’s life, and they can never be overcome. This fatalism, again, impoverishes feminism. It limits what we can hope for women growing up in an imperfect era and resigns us to a view of women as permanently damaged by childhood experiences of sexism. 

No, Evan; Acknowledging the early negative aspects, of growing up female, is not the same as claiming women are permanently crippled, damaged, stained, (insert any other hyperbolic nonsensical descriptors)... Evan made that leap, not feminists, as an attempt to discount the shared reality & experience of women, as nothing but ""exaggerations."" Stripping the unpleasantness away, won't make it disappear. 

Preaching about TIFs faux male privilege, can't cover up the female sounding undercurrents; the obvious attempts to appease bio males, is a very (female), handmaiden thing to do... the very way Evan chooses to advocate for bio males, over females, including ""TM"" - gives the writer's sex away. 

>Feminism that includes trans women is far more hopeful. It allows for the recognition of difference, for the solidarity that grows out of many divergent paths, and for change and growth beyond ones’ formative experiences. It also leaves room for self-determination, for women and men to know themselves better from the inside than others know them from the outside, and to declare who they are without apology. Trans-inclusive feminism also allows trans men to acknowledge what they have in common with cis women, without forcing them to deny the privilege they may experience once they present as male. McGowan, and others like her, fear that trans people will take something away from feminism. In truth, trans experiences can support feminism and strengthen it. 

People's experiences, especially those that are ""formative"", are what makes people ""who they are""... Trans people are free to declare themselves what ever they want, but they have no right to determine what's right for everyone else. The very thing the author accuses feminism of trying to do, is exactly what the trans movement actually is doing, by speaking over others experiences, in favor of their own... 

No Evan, you have no right to espouse the importance of the trans experience, but then turn around & dictate what other women's experiences are, as well. If Evan wants to stand by the whole: [trans] people know themselves better on the inside, than other's do from the outside... Evan needs to stop being that very outsider, judging how other women feel in the inside... 
######... exactly what Evan forced onto disabled women, sexually abused women, women in other countries, women with other experiences, women like Rose McGowan, etc, who never asked to be spoken for in the first place... 

EVAN can keep the shitty attempts at mansplaining out of my Feminism & gain ""cookies"" from bio males, elsewhere."
">And with my colleague that went to the chinese naturopath(and now cured) after so much modern medicinal failures speaks volumes. 

This, honestly is my biggest gripe. And why I get called a troll here on a regular basis. I've seen this happen repeatedly myself.

All you have to do to get decent SoS ratings is be after Condoleeza Rice, and not be Condoleeza Rice.

>Clinton supporters have stayed quiet this campaign season. Mainly for 2 reasons: (1) Bernie supporters have been violently vocal to the extent that even if Bernie had no flaws and was as angelic as being painted, such obeisance is just plain distasteful. (2) Quite a significant number of Bernie supporters, not all, resemble the vocal anger that the right displayed with Obama's election, many Clinton supporters are moderates and centrists preferring to maintain calm discussions because when a person displays obvious signs of anger, a discussion is not possible (For an anecdotal evidence, just check my comment history and responses to downvoted comments, only a few give me a reasoned explanation of why my comment was wrong, most others just display naked hatred)

This is kind of painting a picture. Plenty of Sanders, Clinton, and Trump supporters understand their stances, policies, et al. Plenty don't care, and pick whoever they think they like as a person. Plenty listen to what TV told them, plenty cut cable and shun ""Big Media"", et cetera.

>Finally, Clinton has taken a lot easy on Sanders this time round perhaps learning from her 2008 campaign. This is an intelligent candidate who knows that given the nature of Sanders support and the intense youth energy she has to tread carefully to ensure bridges are easy to establish later on. There is a sophistication in this approach that is easily lost on those with little context of earlier iterations here. It has the downside of letting wild narratives run away for a brief while, but given she gets the nomination makes it much easier to unify everyone. And in case she doesn't get the nomination, it wouldn't matter anyway.

This just kind of feels like your opinion. The Dem primary started out pretty nice, but both sides have gotten relatively vitriolic (relatively. Not like the GOP of course).

As I mentioned, this theory throws out very important parts of Umineko. Ignoring a few scenes or phrases or even giving some lines a strange interpretation is one thing, but if you actually start taking entire narrative themes out during your reasoning you are going way too far. 
Umineko is a novel that features a series of murder mystery puzzles, and not a murder mystery puzzle hidden behind an entire novel's worth of nonsense and throwaway garbage. 
You are free to develop any theories about Umineko as you please, but you are encouraged to maintain a reasonable level of respect to it as a literary work.

It really isn't a simple murder mystery.

If this is the case, it might be--and I honestly apologize for how condescending this must sound--that you are not approaching Umineko correctly as a whole. 

Umineko is a mature work that demands a lot of attention and thinking from its readers. Reading Umineko for the sake of light entertainment isn't a very good idea: you miss out on the truly great things in Umineko (there's a reason why people love it so much) on one hand, and on the other hand it isn't such a great shut-off-your-brain-and-enjoy action/comedy fun fest.

The church has accepted since before the medieval era even that sex not only has a preoperative end but a unitive end. Your comment is nothing new.

>That is quite different from sheep following a shepherd, both in imagery and in historical practice. A sheep is an unintelligent animal that just blindly obeys the shepherd. 

A sheep is known for being calm and gentle, it's only when the imagery is twisted that it becomes condescending. Shepherds were usually associated with community leaders (previously priests, then community leaders of any sort like professionals). The shepherd giving to the sheep (herding for their good, as they knew it) and in turn the flock giving back to the shepherd is the full metaphor. That giving of the flock requires a sheep die is a literalism that is ignored in the metaphor as it ruins it with its literalism.

>The shepherd directs the sheep at his whim, he is in a sense mentally dominating the sheep's minds. 
Literally any community leader has this same power, hence the need to be a good shepherd.

There's no way to dismiss a relationship too as everyone will have their things and people they look towards for understanding. You're simply abusing a classical metaphor to make it seem bad.

Ah, yes. Let me offer some critique of this analogy:

>You go into a poor neighbourhood.

Why is this a poor neighbourhood? Do you think we all have set amounts of effort to give in relation to this? I think that this makes this seem much worse.

And if someone categorically will not donate to charity, out of stupidity or principle, who will I hit? It's why you don't call people on the no call list.

>Meaningful sacrifice and tell them they need to do more

Is being vegan a sacrifice? No one I know who is vegan would consider it so. Being vegan once you know how to do it is not difficult, outside of condescending amatuer evolutionary dieticians.

I think you must remember that I am just offering my thoughts on Veganism. If you are doing it to reduce the amount of suffering in the world, why not go further? If you are doing it for health reasons would you do it if it provided no health benefits? Would you do it if it were detrimental to your health? Would you do it if it tasted terrible and was no better for your health? If not then don't worry. If you would, then maybe you should think about finding further ways to reduce the amount of suffering in the world.

I also think meat eaters should be consciencous of what they eat... though I cannot see how that could not lead to the distinct feeling that eating meat in and of itself was wrong. Still do the wrong thing as ""right"" as possible."

""vast majority"" give me a break.

The reason many people support Sanders is because they disagree with the current route of the Democratic Party. It's not a progressive party, it's a corporate-first party--the same as the GOP--that just happens to prioritize interests of the working class and poor higher than Republicans do, but again, still below corporate/wealthy interests.

It could just as easily be said that the vast majority of Clinton supporters are satisfied with the same lesser-of-two-evils establishment politics that have corroded our middle class for four decades. Their guiding belief is ""at least it's better than the GOP!"" They don't seem to actually believe in any bold ideas or in making progress, and instead settle for simply acting as a strain on Republican regression.

The condescending manner is hilarious, too. It's part of why so many younger generations are disillusioned with the two modern parties, and can help explain pathetically low voter turnouts. When people are given a Clinton and Bush, young people stay home. Give them a Sanders, and they'll vote.

Even aside from whether ""their view"" could possibly not be one of two binary conditions, and aside from whether their statement was a blatant violation of rule 2 (not to imply their violation justifies a violation from me).... The question is relevant. They explicitly refused to address what they DO believe, despite a request they debate based on that, rather than simply denying what they don't believe.

>(3) I'll reveal that I reported your comment to the mods for one of them to review. Possibly other readers, as well, reported your comment around that time.

Seriously.....And? I mean, I appreciate you admitting you reported it, and you should definitly report anything you think is a violation (but see revelation18's post about reporting)... But,, something that deserves ""review"" is not necessary a bannable offense, and something being submitted for a ""review"" doesn't make it a violation of a rule. 

Do you think I deserve to be banned for it? If so, why??

>>(4a) ezk3626 informs you that:

>This comment was removed because of commandment 2 and 3.

And they do not say how it violates either rule (even after practically begging for an explanation). The mod implies that they felt the discussion was ""verging on"" violating rule 3, and therefore was a violation of rule 2. From elsewhere in the post to the individual I was debating:

>>Your exchange with RedRogueTech has reached a point where the whole thing is Commandment 2 pushing towards Commandment 3.

>>I am going to cut it off here before anything gets worse. If you do have a problem with this message the moderators and I will be okay with putting it back. I am kind of relying on Commandment 10 to save you guys from yourselves. This should not be a regular practice and could easily become high handed.

>>I don't want to discourage users but I think it is pretty clear this thread is heading in a bad direction.

So they were explicitly said another post was NOT against the rules, yet a relevant question was. The mod even appeals to the exceedingly vague catch-all rule 10, with that rather civil explanation. Yet, with me, the tone was literally threatening.

>If anyone makes a personal claim about another redditor, e.g. ""You refuse"" ... ""You appear to be ashamed"", such a comment is likely to violate rule 3.

What?! That's absurd. In a debate YOU respond to what someone else says, or in this case, refuses to say multiple times. How is pointing out someone's repeated refusal to debate their own beliefs (as they add nothing of value to the actual debate) in any way against the rules?? I said they appear to be ashamed of their own beliefs... as in, from an outside perspective, but if there's another reason, they could address that. And to be clear, I have NO CLUE what they do or don't believe, aside from their flair, and did not imply otherwise. Regardless of what they believe, they explicitly refused to say how it was relevant to the debate, so the reason for the refusal became relevant.

Just FYI, I addressed all of this with the mod, and they tacitly accept that it was a sincere non-judgmental question relevant to the discussion, and never explained how this sincere relevant question could violate the rules.

>>This is your second warning in a month. A temporary ban will be considered if it happens again.

To be clear, the first ""warning"" was 1) NOT a warning but a comment removal, 2) Was not for rule 3, and 3) Was a post-hoc determination that a thread of discussion was fruitless... That doesn't make any one particular statement at the time to have been a violation. 

Also, while I do not disagree with rule 2, I do think it's somewhat absurd to consider it a bannable offense, unless it's done constantly (eg a literal troll). What, in the course of a discussion, may be a perfectly reasonable, relevant and rational post can turn out after the fact to not ultimately be useful. Or, perhaps even ""heading in a bad direction"". People shouldn't be banned, or given a violation, for something they had no way to know at the time, let alone never did at all.

Also, I find it despicable that something that is NOT described as a ""warning"" is then used as an excuse later to ban someone. That ""warning"" was:

>I just removed the whole thread. Commandment 2

and

>This comment was removed because of commandment 2... and maybe 3 depending whether or not you are intentionally misreading the OP.

Nothing in that states it's any sort of a ""warning"". It's just a statement of action... ""removed the thread"".... Okay, and why exactly would I want to dispute that?! The mods should not condemn someone on past actions when they are never given any reasonable chance to dispute what isn't said to be a bannable violation.

Also, note that it was from the same mod. One warning and one action by the same mod should be suspect - not to say that a mod shouldn't do it, rather every mod should take extreme caution when banning anyone, and justifying it by a prior (unstated) warning of their own should give every mod pause. 

>If any redditor violates some rules over some period of time, the mods write warnings, and if violations continue, give a temporary ban. I support the mods in taking that approach to violators.

First, I find ""temporary bans"" to be condescending. We shouldn't be treated like children, to be put in time out.

Second, not all rules are created equal. Three offenses for something that turns out later to not be quality shouldn't merit even one ""warning""... Just remove the comments, and life goes on. And not all violations are the same. This wasn't a personal attack of any sort. At worst (at least that anyone at all, including the mod, has explained) it's a violation of rule 2 and not 3, but ONE snide, ""sarcastic"" or ""passive aggressive"" statement that could - with imagination - be considered ""antagonistic"" is not the same as two explicit insults.

Third, the rules are vague. If they are intended to include relevant non-rhetorical questions, then the rules should specify that debate isn't allowed.

I'm not pretending anything: your remarks on my comments are consistently very strange, you evidently are laboring under pervasive misunderstanding about what it is I am saying.

We can deal with that problem reasonably, try to resolve this misunderstanding so that you can understand what I'm saying, and then see what your objections to that are, if you still have any.

The only thing like disagreement in my comment was my disagreement with your misrepresenting my remark about how the term 'atheism' is sometimes used in a way which subsumes what is normally called 'agnosticism', and my disagreement with your misattributing to me the aim of telling people they're wrong to call themselves atheists. But these aren't really disagreements so much as you simply misrepresenting me, and me trying to correct the record.

The rest of the post was just puzzlement at what seemed like a long list of non sequiturs from you.

As for responding to the ""details"" of your comment rather than to the ""message"" of it, I'm afraid I can't guess what this distinction might mean.

> The only part that specifically related to you in the first post was the single sentence where I mentioned your name. 

Well, in the last comment, when I asked what your objection to me was, you answered ""First, everything I just said above already"", i.e. referring to the remarks of your original comment. So you can understand why I responded to this claim that the remarks of your original comment were objections to me. You seem to be saying now that they weren't objections to me, which does explain my not finding any objections there. Anyway, I think that settles this point.

> Didn't say you were responsible...

I asked you what your objections were to what I said, and you answered ""Second, your post is linked every time...[etc.]"" So you can understand why I responded to this claim that other people linking my post was an objection to something I've said. You seem to be saying now that it isn't, which is consistent with my not finding it to be an objection. So I'm glad that point is settled too.

> ...and didn't ask you to come here to defend yourself. 

I don't have any interest in ""defend[ing] myself."" I have an interest in people being reasonable, when I say things I give reasons for them, I stand behind them just so far as the reasons support them, and so I have an interest in engaging with reasonable criticisms to things I've said.

You--correct me if I'm wrong--are someone I've never spoken to before, posting in a community I don't post in, dedicated to a subject I find obnoxious, made a post referencing by name, with the /u/ code so that I would be notified about it, making snide remarks about me. I give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that your snide remarks were just a clumsy way of expressing some reasonable critique you were interested in offering for discussion, and so I responded by inviting you to offer that.

If you were in fact interested in that, then here we are. If not, then I guess we're done here.

> I said that others should not blindly link to your post...

If people other than me are doing something you object to, I suggest you take it up with them. It's not my concern. What I had asked you for is what your objections to things I'd said were. You seem to have agreed above that I'm not responsible for things other people do, so let's consider this point settled and drop it.

> ...your post, which is based off something you quoted by SEOP, which is based on wrong information.

My comments reference two peer-reviewed academic resources (the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy), a comment from the editorial staff of one of these resources addressing this specific issue, nine major dictionaries, perhaps the most important book on atheism from the so-called ""New Atheists"" (Dawkins' God Delusion), a comment by another of the ""New Atheists"" (Hitchens) on this specific issue, and an etymological dictionary.

If we're to accept that the content of these works is ""wrong"", you'll have to provide more support for this thesis than your mere say so.

> That's you refuting those ideas...

No, it isn't. (B) is just a definition, while (A), (C), and (D) are just consequences of a definition. As such, there isn't anything here to refute--as I explain at length in the second of my comments.

> ...those ideas that hardly anyone holds.

If indeed I were refuting them, it would be all the better for me the less people who hole them.

> I am claiming to be an atheist...

Yes, but why are you telling me this? I don't care what you're claiming to be. Am I forgotten some extended conversation we've had in the past where I started caring about what you call yourself? Unless I am, call yourself a tortoise for all I care.

But whatever you call yourself, if you're going to call me out by name, in a way so that I'll be notified that you're doing it, while making snide remarks about me--back them up with some reasoned argument.

> ""This is like"" is what you said before that. You said they are like in comparison.

They are alike in the sense--stated in the comment you're quoting--that both of them are a case where two different notions are included under the reference of a single term.

This is rather different than them being ""the exact same thing"", which of course they are not, and never did I suggest otherwise.

> Atheist is the same, as it includes agnostics as well.

Says you, but I supplied numerous references, including peer-reviewed academic sources, claiming the opposite.

Moreover, agnostics claim the opposite. Indeed, the term was coined explicitly to distinguish it from atheism. Here's Huxley, who coined the term, explaining his motivation for it: ""When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last."" (Huxley, Agnosticism) NB: he calls himself an agnostic because he identifies as having ""neither art nor part"" with neither theism nor atheism. Indeed, in his earliest published statement on the matter, he claims from the agnostic's standpoint, atheism is more objectionable than theism (Huxley, Agnosticism: A Symposium).

Furthermore, he identifies (in Agnosticism) Kant's epistemology as the framework and basis for the position he is calling by this name. Kant is likewise explicit about this position being antithetical to atheism. Indeed, he goes so far as to state in the preface to his Critique of Pure Reason that one of its goals is to ""cut off, at the very root"" the basis for atheism (B xxxiv). This aim is reiterated as the conclusion of his comments on theology (B 668+).

(NB: To the list of references I've given for my comments, add these three primary sources.)

This is particularly important, since this whole exchange began with you complaining how condescending it was to tell people what they're allowed to call themselves. It turns out this complaint was misdirected: I've never maintained that someone calling themselves an atheist should not do so. But, even worse, this complaint, ironically, deserves to be directed to your position. For the principle that people should be allowed to determine what to call themselves is the very principle I'm defending, against the demand--here championed by you--that agnostics, in spite of vehemently rejecting this notion, have to be identified as atheists.

> I don't know what your ""what?"" question is in reference to.

Well, your comment that I'd quoted before it. I suppose you could read my ""What?"" as a ""What on earth are you talking about?""

> Is this the complete extent of your SEOP evidence? 

You're asking me if the complete extent of my reference to the SEP is a reference to, in particular, the peer-reviewed article found there which explicitly addresses the issue at hand? What else would I refer to in an encyclopedia other than the article which is about the topic we're discussing?

> I say that I disagree with him, most specifically because he starts the entire argument with what I consider a false definition...

Yes, I understand that you consider the claims we can consistently find in peer-reviewed academic resources false. That would be the whole point of referring someone like you to such resources.

Your implication seems to be that all my references to primary sources and peer-reviewed scholarship get trumped by you saying they're wrong. But this is such a bizarre response, that I feel like it doesn't really need any rebuttal from other than to simply point it out. I mean, I expect any reader I could sway with argument already sees the problem for you here.

It depends on how you describe fairness and respect. One way it might fit me is I don't believe any well-meaning person should be condescended to or seen as ""lesser."" On the other hand, I am also a misanthrope, which means I actively detest the fraudulence of social rituals and those who cling to those ideals the most; those who literally act like everything is a market to compete in, those who ""must"" seem like a winner in any scenario. I am quick to judge and of course, more than happy to avoid folks who ""tip the scale"" too much in that way. That's a LOT of people, I perceive this to be a typical NT quality (not that Aspies can't be ""excessively prideful"" sometimes) and of course the majority is NT.

What I truly respect is folks who don't condescend to others who might be ""beneath"" them. There are folks like this as well, but not too many in my experience.

You can either understand this as being someone who claims to believe in respect and fairness, but hypocritically judges folks on perceived superficial behavior; or as I like to call it, a ""pleasant misanthropist"" who hates labels and doesn't follow mainstream ideals.

No, it's the not the same at all. It's kind of the opposite. Stereotypical gender roles effect both men and women, but women get a much shittier deal out of the whole thing.

"> You know when the DK1 kickstarter first came to be...

I agree, I supported the beginning of DK1 from a different perspective - I was already working for commissions that were using Sony HMZ's and looking at other HMD approaches in out-of-home. We always hoped that the OVR's executives support of a VR arcade concept would lead to a commercial business, it was a shame that this possibility was squandered. 

> I had no idea that the whole VR thing would blow up this much and the thought of multiple competing

It's not that I pick what to answer right now, more so that I lack time and I've been replied to more than 300 times (and each and every reply requires time..), I'll think about tagging people that know more than me though (but in general I ask on the mod group before answering if I'm unsure anyway).

When the person is banned but the abuse still continues, we need to adapt and use our last resort measure. The content ban really wasn't actually brought up (according to the info I have) up until the very last moment when it repeatedly kept going. I think that content bans are a good manner to keep people in check as long as you give proper terms beforehands (as in what they need to do to get their content back) and to make sure they keep to those terms later on or their content would be banned again. To me, the person is the content and the content is that person's. I don't think someone should profit of a platform he so easily chooses to abuse and anything's fair game to get him to stop. As I said before though, I believe the content ban could now be removed and the person put on watch but that's not only up to me to make.

For the first ten minutes, I was being lectured on how carrying a knife on pepper spray is ""a threat against the police"" as if it was the reason I was told to get off my bike. I'm a reasonable person. I don't come off swinging like a sarcastic smartass without cause. I had no interest in hearing this officers drivel over why carrying a knife and pepper spray gives him reason to act like a jackass. Even more irritating, he didn't know they were legal and had this assumption that they weren't.

>Also, the police do have every legal right to stop you and ask you off your bike just like they'd be allowed to ask you to step out of your vehicle.

Legally. An officer can't just order you off your bike or out of your car without a legal reason. I'm well within my rights to ask why and if the officer had responded by saying ""well, we got this report about a white guy wearing a black t-shirt..."" right off the bat instead of removing me from my bike, I probably would have gotten off my bike on my own and been a bit less chatty.

>If you know you've done nothing wrong then there's zero reason for you to become confrontational back.

That alone, yeah. Sure. Except this guy came out swinging like a jerk. I wasn't being confrontational, but I was being assertive. Multiple times, I made it clear the knife and pepper spray aren't a crime when he tried using them to justify his attitude. Every time he had an aggressive tone or attitude while he was talking, I kept interrupting him. People like him are not the kind of people that should be police officers and I wasn't going to let him off easy.

>In fact, it's in your best interest to start recording any adverse police behavior and remain calm and polite throughout the entire interaction... especially if you want people to be on your side of the argument.

I think it's in my best interest to record any encounter period, something I learned from this incident. I did remain calm, but I treated the officer like I would anyone else in a position of authority being needlessly aggressive and intimidating. Go figure, most of the people I've shared this with are on my side.

>All I can see is what I see in the video, which stars off with the officer asking a simple question in what sounds like a reasonably polite tone and you responding with anger and defensive statements.

I can understand this. Until you just pointed it out, I didn't understand the perception some people would have because from the video, that is the first thing the officer said. Take my word for it, that isn't the first thing he said. I went out of my way to make that comment about ""am I stopping you from doing your job?"" because of how he had been acting as soon as he got out of his car. I wouldn't that be sarcastic to anyone right off the bat and not without good reason.

>Why couldn't you wait for your turn to speak? Or better yet not said a word?

I didn't want to. I had spent the last five to ten minutes being treated like a criminal for having a knife and pepper spray.

>Please. You got a ticket for not having a bell on your bike. That's more like him tossing the pamphlet at you...

Because he couldn't find anything else to ticket me over. Book, pamphlet. Whatever. He should have apologized and let me go when it was clear I wasn't the person they were looking for, instead of finding something to ticket me over. That right there is what bothers a lot of people.

>They did. Got a wreckless scofflaw like yourself to pony up the dough. I'm glad they cited you for riding unsafely without a proper sounding device. They should have cited you for riding with that boot on your foot too. Looks dangerous as fuck.

Yeah, I'm so reckless for not having a bell on my bike. Please. The charges were dropped, I used PTO so I didn't lose any money from work, and I sold the air horn I had bought a month or two after this happened. No money lost. Though, I did back a Kickstarter project for some cheap, but well engineered bell. I might put that on my bike when it shows up.

I was clipped in on my good foot and I had a front break. Wasn't dangerous at all.

>The police are legally permitted to do all of those things for their own safety, and it's up to their discretion. [...] They're allowed to ask someone with a CCW to step away from their firearm for the duration of a traffic stop as well. They can take it, or ask you to step out of your vehicle. This is all legal and permissible and for the officer's safety. 

My comment was regarding the attitude I was given for possessing them. I can completely understanding them wanting to disarm someone during a stop out of safety concerns, but it was how they did that. I was immediately ordered off my bike without any explanation and forcibly removed when I asked why. Both weapons were removed without asking me to remove them and set them on the ground on front of me and walk backwards. I never touched them or went to touch them. Then, I was treated like some kind of criminal just for having them. I've seen other redditors in /r/rochester that have their CCW (/u/BreezyD, IIRC) admit they've been hassled more than once by RPD for carrying, so, as I was saying...

>I can't possibly know if you're telling the truth here or not.

Point taken.

>If he was a dick from the get-go then obviously he was in the wrong. File a complaint with the department and show them your video of his 'misconduct' if you want.

Clearly, I don't have the entire incident from beginning to end, so it'd be a moot point. That and I find the notion of filing a complaint with RPD laughable since it's other cops investigating each other. My own lawyer advised against it specifically because there would be nothing stopping them from harassing me if I did.

>I actually know the police chief in the city... he was one of my criminal justice professors. I'll be sure to put in the good word for you. 

I know him too. I've talked to him publicly and privately on more than one occasion. Approachable, friendly, but I have no confidence in him to rein in his officers at all unless there is extremely damning video evidence.

>No, you sarcastically interrupted him and said 'yeah yeah you've got a report and you're just doing your job' then the officer threw it back at you. 

No, I interrupted him and finished his sentence so he knew I understood. The officer that was talking then was actually not a dick. I wasn't being sarcastic with him at all and had no desire or reason to. The only thing he said at all during that entire encounter is what you heard in that video where he explained the report about the suspicious white male wearing a black t-shirt. He didn't give me any shit about the knives or the pepper spray.

The other officer had an attitude, but he had one to begin with.

>Can you not hear yourself? You didn't 'ask him if you weren't' you spewed more sarcasm.

My exact words were ""Am I stopping you from doing your job?"". My ""attitude"" as you and him put it, stemmed directly from his condescending and intimidating behavior. He started acting like that off the bat and continued acting like that, blaming it was on the knife and pepper spray, even after he already had them on the back of his car. Telling him that they're not a crime to have isn't being sarcastic. It's being assertive and well within my rights to be.

>Police officers have a very stressful job. People with weapons who are being dismissive and don't seem to want to cooperate would be quite stressful. The officers had every right to stop and question you, I'd probably be short with you too. 

I don't disagree, but when that video started, my weapons were already on the back of his car and he was removing my Chrome bag without asking. I wasn't making it difficult for him to do that. I was dismissive and uncooperative because Officer Jackass had been and was being aggressive and intimidating. He could have changed his attitude and I would have mine. It's pretty simple and near everyone here understands this except you and maybe another half dozen people.

>Nah, getting yelled at by the cops is deserved by many people. If they didn't physically abuse you I'd say you should just get over it.

This mindset is a problem. Police misconduct is a problem. Civil rights violations are a problem. Dismissing this because I wasn't physically abused is so dense and naive that I don't even know what to say.

>No. That's because the hivemind hates cops.

Well, I wonder why? Seriously. Why would ANYONE hate cops?!

>You're making this out to be way worse than it is. You got a ticket for doing something wrong. You did do that something wrong.... and you could have easily prevented that ticket. I'm 99% sure of it.

No, you're making this out to be less serious than it is. I was stopped because I fit the description of someone looking through car windows in a parking garage. I didn't let that officer intimidate me and made it clear to him that he wasn't. That doesn't make it remotely okay for him to find something to ticket me over. Contempt of cop, misconduct, abuse of power. That is what it is. A cop going out of his way to find something to ticket me over. It's wrong. Period.

>It does give you the right to ticket someone for breaking a law though!

No, it doesn't. Especially when it comes to victimless crimes. This is why peace officers have the discretion on charging violations and misdemeanors. Just because there's enough to charge someone with a violation doesn't mean it is serving any kind of public good (or as Jim Sheppard has put it in the past, ""spirit of service"")."
"We know Jon worked at the Institute before and I think Tim mentioned during a conversation with Martin that he was fine in research before he took the job as assistant. So I think Jon and Tim worked together as researchers and then, once Jon got promoted, he wanted Tim for the job because he already knew he's good at this stuff.

There's a little thought crawling around in my head for a while now. Maybe Jon is more comfortable being around and speaking/working with women in general? I mean, he was raised by his grandma, had (as it sounded) almost no friends and was bullied by this older guy who got eaten by Mr. Spider. So he might associate overall positive experiences with females and more negative ones with males. 

If that's the case it would explain why his paranoia was much more aggressively focused towards Tim and Martin. It always sounded to me like he respected Sasha for her work more than the others. And he was instantly on good terms with Basira. Also Georgie seems to be the only one who can point out his shortcomings without eliciting a negative response. I don't think this is only because he was bumming out on her couch. Melanie is an exception because she was snotty and condescending to him and about his work in their first talk and Daisy just radiates murder vibes towards him.

"> Roberts is in no place to call McConnel's piece poorly written or criticize him for talking to his audience like they're children.

Huh? I have to ask if you've actually read the WSJ piece. Because it's every bit as dumbed-down and condescending as Roberts describes it. Hear are some excerpts:

> The trick is that there’s no method to designate electrons on the grid as originating from one source or another. Power generated by fossil fuels and wind turbines travels together over poles and underground wires before reaching cities, homes and businesses. No customer can use power from wind and solar farms exclusively.

> “You don’t know exactly when the sun is going to shine or when the wind is going to blow. 

> But coal is the bedrock of affordable electricity, and it will remain so, no matter how much wishful thinking by environmental activists. Coal is abundant and reliable. Unlike wind and solar, coal generation can be dialed up and down in response to market conditions and to satisfy demand.

> The rise of renewable generation is made possible by fossil fuels, not despite them.

I can't believe anyone would defend this. 

> So the physical reality limits the ability of accounting to continue this way. That's what Roberts ignores.

That's a strawman. He makes no claim that this path will eventually eliminate fossil fuels nor does he need to. The only claim made by these cities and corporations is that they will produce and/or purchase and amount of renewable energy on the grid equal to what they consume. They don't claim that ""every electron comes from a solar panel, wind turbine or hydro dam"" or the demand equals that supply of renewable energy at every instant. Or that they will be independent grids of pure renewable energy. Any of these claims would be nonsense given that they are connected to a larger grid. 


> So the physical reality limits the ability of accounting to continue this way. 

Of course. That's what he says.

> That's what Roberts ignores.

He doesn't though.

"I appreciate your honesty. I can assure you that I have put a lot of thought in to this project. If you check out my account on the BTCtalk forum, you'll noticed I jumped in to that forum in the same way as I did here. This is because I had the idea for the project and had been a lurker of that forum for some time but had no reason to get involved with the forums until I was ready to start my project. I feel that's the same thing here, although I'll admit I didn't lurk this subreddit long, I did visit it and subscribed a little while ago on my personal account. (which, if a mod can check in to that some how, I'd be happy to verify with them but I'm sure no one cares that much haha. I remember reading recently about a cop having someone call in a target, and looking at a cleverly hidden cache on a sign that I couldn't find until I read the comments.)

>In response to your question: ""Where exactly did I try to sound ""like I know something about geocaching""?"" 

You'll notice in that same quote immediately after I actually say ""I do know something about geocaching"" which in that literal sense you're taking it would contradict myself. I mean this in the sense that I do have a basic understanding of how this game works, I have done research. However, I have not engaged the community yet, which this was my first time doing. When I asked ""what exactly..."" my question was genuine. I wanted to know what it is I didn't know.

The quote regarding me walking around looking for a little box is definitely not meant to sound condescending, I want to know what will change over the course of the next two days. I expect that it will be very similar to hiking, but with a task, which I enjoy the thought of and I am excited to try... but all of this ""you gotta experience it"" stuff doesn't make sense to me because I'm looking at it from the ""I'm developing a project to add to this"" side. 

To me, it's common sense that putting essentially money in caches is a incredible incentive to get people interested in geocaching. Creating a currency strictly limited to geocaching removes outsiders desire mess with it (both in the real world and online). I want to set up stores where future profits go to fund future targets and geocachers can get hooked up with better geocaching gear simply by playing the game they enjoy and are already playing... it really seems like a no-brainer to me that it would be accepted which is why I jumped in to it with such enthusiasm. 



>In your original post ""We're turning Geocaching.."" you come off..

Again, this was originally written for the miners and investors that will be required to get this off the ground. It was suggested to me that get the geocaching community level involved on the ground level so I brought it over here. In my original post I'm asking questions and looking for feedback about what geocachers would want. The first question is ""Is this something you would be interested in?"" - I honestly just wanted, and still want, the community's help in developing a project. Saying a ""real treasure hunt"" is because ""real treasure"" has monetary value, which is what this is. It seems you and the community have taken insult from things you simply assumed were meant to call down your community, for some reason I really don't know. This was never my intention and to think that someone would pitch an idea laced with insults is hilarious to me. 

The top reply is quoting something directed not at the geocaching community at all. Yes, it was posted here, but taking it as an insult is silly. It was directed at a what is generally perceived as a nerdy community as a tongue in cheek joke. Nothing else. People will be able to buy the coin to buy a cheaper GPS if they want, or buy the coin to fill a cache, or buy the coin to keep it. This is something that needs to happen in order to have a coin people can redeem for gear.

The second to top is telling me I don't understand geocache and that both names are terrible without offering any constructive criticism. That user never responded to my very friendly response explaining. There was also an upvoted reply to this comment with a baseless accusation saying I just wanted to make money from geocaching.

The third to top comment is saying it's spam and mods should kill it.

The fourth to top comment is when I finally received some constructive criticism. It was a breath of fresh air after the berage of being talked down to.

Yes, I could benefit monetarily and I have never denied this, because I'm investing a lot of time in to it and my time, like anyone's, is worth money. Everything you use was created by someone who was paid to make it. The company I partner with will make a ton of money, and they're established in this industry already making money off of it. Anyone who wants to invest in this will make money. Anyone who wants to mine this will make a little bit of money. Retailers that want to sell it will make a little bit of money. Owners of websites that sell geocaching products and accept this coin will make a little bit of money. Geocachers that hunt for coins and exchange them for cash will make a little bit of money. You say this like me investing my time developing a project to add to the geocaching experience isn't worth being paid. I do this for a living, and can't invest my time in to creating things unless I get paid. That's how the world works.

I'm sorry if you feel that I'm attempting to scam something, but as this project is developed it'll be quite clear that those are not my intentions and that soon after it won't even be possible as I would prefer to hand off the entire project to someone or something trusted by the community. Also, please understand that I am in no way trying to talk down to you in this post. I appreciate your response."
"> Just because you're not personally affected doesn't mean you shouldn't judge certain choices other people make.

This is an obvious truth to you, but do not expect me to share your view automatically. We all get to make our own choices and we all get to deal with the consequences of those choices no matter what they might be. Other people are not involved in either the choice or the consequence, so any judgment from such other people is wasted effort and frequently condescending.

I will agree with you that a fulltime master slave arrangement is a fairly extreme choice--it forces BDSM to be a central, if not totally dominant, factor of one's life that takes up a lot of time. But I think we are understanding the ""consensual"" part of ""safe, sane, and consensual"" guidelines that frame healthy BDSM very differently. I don't view consent as a monolithic thing and think that doing so would be unreasonable. For example, just because a given partner has asked for anal penetration once does not extend blanket permission for the same act in any future play sessions, although of course one may always ask or make such permissions clear in a pre-play discussion of hard and soft boundaries. Such boundaries, even in a 24/7 setting, help form the basis of an ongoing dialogue on how extended scenes are feeling to their participants. If a Dom sees that their 24/7 sub is feeling ill or responding unusually to a given stimulus, the safe, sane, and consensual thing to do is hit pause and check in, see if boundaries need to be modified or if more or different kinds of aftercare are needed. In a safe, sane, and consensual BDSM relationship, the sub should be able to trust that their Dom will take care of them in that way.

Of course there are Doms who have used BDSM as a cover for borderline and outright abusive behavior. This is not because they are Doms, but because they are shitty people. In a good kink community, word about such partners spreads quickly and they find themselves isolated. Such a community will also trust its members to know their own boundaries while providing support (emotional, logistical, legal) if someone comes forward about another member of the community abusively violating the trust inherent to this kind of play.

Because your boss, in addition to being a human being worthy of basic respect and decency, also has a position of authority over you.

They're allowed to arrest and detain anyone who they have reasonable suspicion has committed a crime.

Matching the description of a suspect is absolutely reasonable suspicion.

Being belligerent, arrogant, condescending, a douchebag, or any other myriad things it sounds like you want to do to the cop are in theory extraneous, however they do tie in to reasonable suspicion - if he asks you who you are and you immediately start evading, while you match the description of a suspect, it makes that suspicion all the more reasonable.

And then of course there's the human factor. Cops aren't infallible. You treat them like garbage and they're not going to like you. If they don't like you, they're going to be more inclined to disbelieve your claims, as well as more inclined to believe you are the suspect they're looking for.

You have every right to be an uncooperative asshole. But that doesn't mean that you will see the same outcome. Being friendly and cooperative usually results in a much better outcome. There have been cases of the suspect actually being stopped and not being detained because he was friendly and cooperative, which convinced the cop that he couldn't be the criminal.

You're not wrong, but I've yet to meet one that was interested in persuasion. I'm immediately called a nazi, or a racist, or a sexist, or told my opinion is irrelevant because I'm a white male. So I lose interest in caring about being polite, at that point, since I know they're not going to give a shit about what I say anyways.

I will contend that THIS is the bigger waste of time and emotional effort.

I used to hold the same opinion you do. However, I did eventually come to the conclusion that they are few and far between, and about 90% of your interactions are with obstinate people who have closed off the idea of outside opinions, or them being wrong, to the point that I say they CANNOT listen to reason, rather than WILL not. Because someone who preemptively shuts out other viewpoints cannot hear reason. You don't have the option to will or will not entertain an idea, if you shut the idea out before it's even been said. And that's done, frequently, on the basis that the SPEAKER determines the worth of what is said. This echo-chamber mentality is VERY common now, with being able to filter out, block, unfriend, and cultivate a group of people online who think exactly the same way you do.

Extreme example: ""The speaker is a nazi, so nothing they say is worth listening to, or can be true."" In reality, the nazi may be talking about horticulture, and may be correct in what he says about plants.

Actual example: ""Uummm, I don't recall asking for mansplaining from ignorant white boys, so you can shut up now""

In both these cases, the actual words have been dismissed before they are even spoken out loud. In these examples, a person is not just unwilling, but INCAPABLE of hearing reason, because we don't even reach the step of accepting/declining information.

Awww. I hear this criticism a lot (usually directed at me...). It's a powerful tactic because all the rejoinders I can think of or overly mansplain-y. In general there's a class of arguments that take X to launch, and 10X to rebut. You can win the battle lose the war sort of deal.

Of course, the argument is self defeating. ""The One True Opinion is that different opinions have value!"". But the strength is really in the subtext: you're a neurotic outsider and uncomfortable with normal people. 

Probably true. A damning criticism if you're a loner because you're socially maladjusted, which is what the commenter is implying. That TLP is cut from the same cloth as neckbeards and incels and other low status males. 

Sucks, you know. Because it's basically namecalling under the guise of a socially-responsible sounding argument. My worldview (and the views frequently espoused by TLP et al) is that people are frequently wrong and it screws them over. We shouldn't be surprised to find it's difficult to convince a room full of people that they're idiots.

FWIW none of this ever happens with my friends. The feeling is that it's genuinely interesting to hear disruptive opinions, and the possibility of disagreement is A) nonthreatening and B) basically guaranteed anyway because ""smart"" people disagree on everything. 

Maybe that's the solution. Maybe it should go like this:

A: ""People should be allowed to have their own opinions""
B: ""Are you threatened by disagreement?""
A: ""No, but you can't force everyone to think like you.""
B: ""I am not trying to force everyone to think like me. Just explaining why I disagree""

Maybe the real problem is dog whistles. Maybe when normals hear foreign arguments, it gets a fuzzy mapping and they associate it with a range of imagined attitudes and beliefs. Maybe it's not even their fault. Maybe it's a common human trick to say X and mean Xyz. yz are toxic, so when you see X, you have to attack it because it could be Xyz. 

Modern example is complaining about immigrant criminals (X), which is frequently assumed to be an argument against immigration in general, and possibly racism (yz). And once we state it this way, we can see there's actually an incentive to lump yz onto X, because it speeds up and empowers your reactions dramatically. "

Flapyourwings told me I hold unreasonably long grudges. Well, perhaps that is so, but I don't think that is getting the whole picture.

He just sits there antagonizing the other user, waiting for the other user to quit. The debate just goes around and around in circle achieving no progress. Its so frustrating talking him. He annoyed me so much I wanted to quit and never come back to the subreddit. Only when 7Teen told me he's not worth and to just quit, and it made me feel better.

"It's very hard to comment on this without sounding arrogant or insulting. It's also hard to condense down thousands of pages of theory and the like which are very relevant to just this comment. 

Globally, there has been billions of dollars invested in psychology research alone. Do you know the colours in most major fast food restaurants are picked for specific reasons? Specific colours have been found to trigger increased appetite, other colours result in a decreased time spent in a store. If restaurants can get you to order more, and leave quicker, they make more money.

In supermarkets, companies spend millions of dollars to secure products at, or slightly below, eye level. They want their product at a specific number of paces into an isle, they want specific other products around them. All of this because it triggers a consumer to pick their product up. I've actually gone shopping with people before who claim advertising doesn't work on them. Just one example:

I went grocery shopping with a mate of mine who had gone on a schpiel about how advertising doesn't work. Can't remember exactly what we were buying, think it was salsa or something. We walked down the aisle, there were quite a few similar types of salsa, after picking up 2 different jars of salsa he picked the one which was about 25% more expensive. I asked him why not just get the cheap one, and he said because since it's so cheap it must be of a lower quality.

For companies this is psychology 101. Consumers often think that when they're confronted with 2 similar looking products, the slightly more expensive product is the superior product. Sure a lot of people are money conscious and will always take the cheaper option, but the majority of consumers, when confronted with needing to buy an unknown (or untested) product, they will select the slightly more expensive option since they think they're getting better value for money.

But I completely agree with you in relation to the internet and advertising. The internet has made so much of advertising redundant it actually pains me to read my textbooks. All my textbooks, like every other student knows, are ""up to date"" there's a new version pushed every year, so there's no excuse for textbooks to be omitting so much information in relation to the internet. I've read hundreds of pages from textbooks where I've thought from the first page of a chapter ""this is completely redundant thanks to the internet and smart phones"". 

And I've also got to disagree with your last statement. 

>If marketing is to remain relevant, it has to compete with the past as well as people like me who opt out of the ""must buy new"" culture and consider a good 60 years of products.

I'll just say this. Iphones. All information points that consumers are becoming less conscious of value for money. Even Japanese culture, which has for ever been an exclusive market where the people pay extreme prices for products and therefore use them till they break, have been encroached upon by the must-buy-must-update culture. 

Even if you, personally, research every single buying decision and will often opt to buy second hand, you're in the minority of the minority. Mainstream advertising does not need to concern itself with you. Specifically because you're not buying products. If you're buying second hand products then you're not buying a rivals product. Because you're not buying a rival product a company does not need to worry about their rival making more money than them. While all companies would like a larger market share they can also be content with the fact that their rival does not have you as a customer. Therefore they don't need to worry themselves with you.

I hope that wasn't too insulting or condescending. I also had to type it out very quickly, but I hope I got my point across. "
"> In the theatre we have a clash of ideals on how humanity should be guided. 
 
kudos to Tomino for the excellent direction in that scene. the purposeful shot composition, the elaborate staging, the gorgeous use of lighting, juxtaposition, and focus, he manages to go into the psyche of each of the main actors in the war while also highlighting who they are as people through explicit framing. the hollow backlighting to emphasize Scirocco's condescending attitude towards everyone around him, the distanced shots of Haman to emphasize how her strategy of having others fight for her has been lifting her out of the conflict from its shadows, the bright light that Char has to look up to to emphasize how blinding his optimism has been, and Kamille, showing up from stage left, to emphasize how he (and soldiers in general) only serve as a bit part in a play that encompass all of human history. he manages to convey a lot through his handling of the scene, making it a true climax to everything that has happened thus far in a layered and deeply symbolic way.
 
> Zeta Gundam is a show where people's pasts have come to really strongly dictate who they are and often what defines their actions. Char, Reccoa, Four, Rosamia, Katz etc. And here, Kamille was essentially freed from his past.

this is a brilliant summation of what essentially happened here. it may be bleak, and a spiritual cleansing at the hand of a mental death isn't necessarily the healthiest way to go about it, but it's probably one of the best case scenarios that could have happened, especially given all the foreshadowing up to this point. "
"> when you are constantly harassed over your character choice can you really be blamed when you retaliate with BM like Zack does?

Yes, you can and should be blamed. Being disrespectful as an audience member is one thing, because no one has any high expectations towards an audience. A professional player on the other hand, is expected to behave, well, professionally. That is the case in any professional environment.

Which is why if you happen to see someone throwing a fit in a store, the staff try their best to act politely throughout the encounter. Sure, everyone loses it sometimes, that's just human. But Zack's entire attitude is hostile, condescending and quizzacious. There's a difference."
"> Winston Churchill said, ""Dogs look up to us, cats look down on us, but pigs treat us as equals.""

Which is why they're such difficult pets haha. Dogs are morons, and cats are happy to sleep all day and shoot you a condescending glance from time to time. But pigs are emotionally needy. Don't get one until you're prepared for a clever little bastard who wants constant attention, mental stimulation, and food. It's like having a perpetual toddler around."
"> I don't have to prove everything we are allowed to do is spelled out in the Bible and called permissible. Impermissable is not the default. In other words, we don't just call everything impermissible by default unless the Bible specifically calls it permissible. By such an ""impermissible by default"" standard, it is a sin to throw a ball because the Bible never says it is okay. It isn't my job to ""prove"" from the Bible that every single thing is okay. If you think something is sinful, it is your job to show where the Scriptures say it is a sin. And you've provided no Scriptures that say sexual pleasure before marriage is a sin. You're just making that rule up.

The issue is that just because something isn't specifically listed as you want it worded, it doesn't make it supported or even okay. As I mentioned before, the bible builds it's case for sex within marriage.

> No, I'm applying the same standard across the board: if we're going to say X is a sin, we have to show where the Bible indicate X is sinful. You're applying different standards across the board. For instance, you wouldn't say throwing a ball is sinful simply because the Bible never says its okay. Yet at the same time you're saying I have to prove where the Bible says sexual pleasure before marriage is okay. That's a double standard; that is hypocrisy.

I never said you had to prove where the bible says sex before marriage is okay. I said I think the bible has verses that shows what marriage is intended for and where sex is supposed to take place and based on these verses, it suggests Christians are supposed to abstain from sex prior to marriage.

> Some people simply refuse to be convinced. No amount of rational thought will convince those who are determined to maintain their position no matter how irrational. Having ears they don't hear, having eyes they don't see.

I could say the same about you, but who would I be to condescending assert that you're intentionally being intellectually dishonest about what you're reading? I have no ties to the ""purity"" lifestyle, so I wouldn't care to fight to kept that alive. I'm telling you what I see from reading scripture. It honestly doesn't seem like something that is permissible. That is how I see. You disagree, cool, but you don't have to have this ""holier than thou"" attitude.

> No, sorta like promiscuity. Sexual pleasure before marriage doesn't necessarily have to be in the context of a promiscuous relationonship though. I've not said promiscuity is okay and indeed I believe it is a sin (Romans 13:13 says to avoid drunkeness and ""sexual promiscuity,"" NASB). What I've said is that sexual pleasure before marriage is not always necessarily sinful. Similarly, drinking alcohol doesn't always have to be in the context of drunkenness and addiction. Drinking alcohol isn't necessarily sinful, it can be sinful in some contexts but it isn't always sinful by default. If a couple is not being promiscuous, there is no higher chance of them contracting an STD than a married couple, no higher chance of an unplanned pregnancy than a married couple, and no chance at all of the family history not being known (the father not being known). So sexual pleasure before marriage doesn't necessarily lead to those things.

I'll reply to this in 3 parts.

1. The issue here is that other versions of the Bible list this differently. NASB says ""promiscuity"", but others say ""sexual immortal and debauchery"" or something. Can you go back and find the original word use to see what it actually was saying?

2, You assume that the couple having sex will stay together. The problem develops when, since neither partner is committed to one another, they could have sex with someone else down the line. Also, the fact is the more different people you have sex with, the high chance you are to catch an STD. This is an unavoidable fact. Since ""sexual pleasure before marriage being okay"" has no real basis on to when they can have sex, these people don't need to be a couple. Let's assume they are a couple, though. They've been having sex for 2 months. They break up. Both go to different relationships weeks-months later and start having sex shortly in the relationships. The problem lies in that neither of these people would be consider promiscuous, but there is undeniable increase in a chance of catching an STD or whatever.

3. The drinking analogy doesn't really check out. Just because drinking itself is okay and drunkeness isn't, doesn't mean the same standard can be applied across the board(this is the issue with your little ""I'm doing it all the same across the board"" method you mentioned earlier). The issue lies in the fact that sex outside of marriage seems to not be approved of, based on the verses suggesting to marry to burn your sexual desires or not marry and be celibate. It's never encouraged or approved of. Unlike throwing a ball, sex is a big topic within the bible and I earnestly feel it was discussed enough to let us know where it should take place.

> And you're just making that up out of nowhere too because the Scriptures never say it is sinful to greatly desire another person. ""Epithymeō,"" the Greek word for lust, simply means intense desire. There is nothing wrong with desiring your wife intensely or even your girlfriend in some situations. Indeed the Song of Solomon is a poetic celebration of a couples' intense desires for one another, both before and after their wedding. Indeed, hopefully spouses will desire one another with intense passion. There is nothing wrong with that, and the Bible never says there is. In context, Jesus was saying it is sinful to look at another person's wife with lust because he was talking about adultery and how it can occur in the heart. Looking at your own wife with intense desire is not adultery; God designed sex to be an intensely passionate experience. Intense desires are part of being sexual beings.

You assumed, though. You assumed that it said ""another's wife"". It wasn't actually said to be about someone else's wife. So why is it an issue that I'm thinking it refers to sexual lust, while yours is okay even though it is an assumption? About the song of solomon, that is part of the problem I'm having. A wedding is only a ceremony. What is the consummation of marriage? I could be married, by oath, to my girlfriend. Does the song ever go into such a description?

> No. As I said, Judah and Tamar are never said to be married and are never referred to as husband and wife, not in the story, never in any geneolgoy... they simply had sex. That didn't make them married according to the scriptures. The Bible never states any rule that having sex equals being married. That too is your rule. You seem to have a habit of making up rules and pretending your rules are God's.

My problem with you is you have all these super condescending ways of trying to mock me. I'm not ""trying to pretend my rules are God's rules"". I'm reading the bible and what I end up thinking it is saying and suggesting is what I'll believe we're supposed to do or not do(sort of like any Christian ever. I don't read the bible to confirm my own thoughts and wants. If I did, I promise that I wouldn't be here now. All I am is a man trying his best to understand his religion, so excuse me.

What makes it worse is your hypocrisy. To claim what I'm believing is me pretending it is God's rule is just the same as claiming to know God is okay with something simply because you think it's ""not listed"".

I do apologize for the Judah and Tamar part where I thought they were married, I was thinking of another story. I'm not claiming sex instantly means someone is married before God's eyes. I'm saying that is what I was getting from reading scripture and is something I'm confused about. If that's wrong, then its wrong, but then there is a lot of explaining to do on your half. You mention that Judah and Tamar don't later marry, but this doesn't directly mean them having sex wouldn't mean they were married. It just means it wasn't mentioned.

> Becoming one flesh is having sex and it needs to be avoided with a prostitute because God said so. I don't know the mind of God so I can't tell you exactly why He has said everything He has. However, I can guess if you'd like. Again, as I already said, sex in the context of prostitution necessarily results in extremely high risk of STDs and unplanned pregnancy with no stable family situation or even known family history. That's not fair to the children involved. Promiscuity leads nowhere good, and prostitution is inherently promiscuous by its nature. It also often includes the victimization of women or in some cases of men.

You don't know the mind of God...but you sure know that he's cool with premarital sex, though.

Your argument against prostitution sounds exactly like arguments used against premarital sex. You could end up in a lot of those situations because you chose to have premarital sex prior to marriage. So by that very standard, we should be avoiding it.

> I'm not ignoring you either; I'm sorry it has apparently seemed to you that I am. I likewise don't see how someone can think I'm not trying to hear them out when I'm taking the time to ask questions, listen to answers, and respond accordingly.

All the condescending remarks definitely don't help your case. Not to mention the generalizations about ""conservatives"", which make it hard to believe that you weren't talking about me within that group, until I called you out on it."
"> Yep. If I'm being honest and maybe this is bad

Actually I see it as something good. It means you aren't being nosy hence you can't be judgemental and giving people 'life tips' which are usually thought of condescending. It's much more useful to share a useful fact rather than telling someone how you think they should live."
"Maybe you aren't arguing in bad faith but when you say something like 


> It's been verified that we're in a massive housing crisis 

It's hard to not view that as anything other than condescending. Obviously I believe there is a crisis.

I am actually far more open to solutions on solving this than my polemic rhetoric may suggest but the fact of the matter is the sub is rife with bad faith actors who are simply concerned with solutions that would benefit them and if doesn't help the economically marginalized their reaction is ""so what?"", but they know they can't say that so they make points in bad faith, move goal posts, wind people up, etc.

And that matters because when you let these toxic people control the debate you cede it all to the misinformed and uninformed and we have seen how toxic communities online have contributed to IRL problems.

What I will not bend on, though, is my prior, and it is no ""solution"" is acceptable if it asks more of, or puts the burden on, the economically marginalized, something the YIMBYs are okay with."
"> Firstly, I don't think it's healthy you are letting a lady who struggles to communicate effectively bother you so much.

Yes it is. When someone is condescending and socially clueless every single time you have to work with them, that's draining and grating and it's completely appropriate for OP to feel stressed about it.

> She might be annoying as all hell but she doesn't seem to be impairing your work or your social life.

Yes she is. OP gave examples of how Gladys is impacting both her work and her socialization at work.

> I think you should just try to keep your conversations short. Do not be rude or cold, that is a one way ticket to a bad meeting with your manager. If your workplace requires communication, it's not your place to decide she can't speak to you to do her job.

Yes it is. If Gladys' style of communication is hindering and distracting to every other person there, the problem is with Gladys, and not OP, and she's absolutely justified in deciding how and when Gladys can speak to her."

> When you look out an airplane window. Horizon is flat.

Just as you should expect when you consider the immense scale of the earth and the inaccuracy of the human eye at detecting minute changes. When your 12km up in the sky, you shouldn't be expecting to detect curvature upon a 40,000km sphere. 

>Not one experiment proves Gravity. Not one.

Not only is this incorrect, its also entirely irrelevant. The ancient Greeks, Chinese and Egyptians knew the earth to be round well over 2000 years ago and had no idea about the existence of gravity and neither would the rest of humanity until 1700 years later. As for the existence of gravity, i recommend learning about The Cavendish Experiment carried out by Henry Cavendish in 1798

> Water takes the shape of its container right? So what is containing the oceans? Is the water magnetically attached to this so called spinning ball?

Water takes the shape of its container unless there are external forces acting upon the water. Such as gravity. Gravity has nothing to do with magnetism. In addition, even if we didn't understand why water curved around the earth, that wouldn't mean that it didn't or change the fact that it does. Only that we were ignorant to the cause. 

>Not one photo of Earth from space is not photo shopped. Not ONE

Even if what you say is true its utterly irrelevant. We don't need pictures from space to know that the earth is spherical. Furthermore, photoshopped doesn't mean completely altered. If i take a photo of my dog and change the saturation and brightness, is my dog fake ?

> The thing about flat earth is that there's no way in hell you can believe it if you are not accustomed to conspiracy theories, but if you dive deep enough down the rabbit hole. It makes more and more sense.

Im not a fan of conspiracy theories. While i find them interesting and intriguing, i find them to be the result of cognitive bias, our ability to detect agency and pattern where there are none and the feeling they give their advocators of specialness and uniqueness. This combination is a powerful drug and the results are damning. What i am a fan of is evidence and if you can find any that supports a flat earth theory that hasn't already been debunked three thousand times then id be delighted to see it. 

> Now before you try to counter me by saying. - What about time zones? - What about other planets? - Anything that doesnt answer the questions above. I ask you to please try and answer my questions before you start trying to debunk the flat earth as a whole. Because thats the problem with all these skeptics. They don't answer the questions the flat Earthers are asking. They ridicule them for even questioning the shape of earth as if they are 100% sure. How can anyone be %100 sure without visual evidence. Granted; flat earthers don't have much visual evidence either, but they do have eye's that see's a Flat Horizon, no matter how high up in the air you go. The only fucking evidence people have of this Round earth and Gravity is in our history books and photo shopped pictures. I guarantee you that nobody has ever seen the round earth with their own eyes.

I feel like i answered your questions adequately, and might i add there are tremendously more damning objections to a flat earth theory than time zones or other planets. Its perfectly fine to ask questions and inquire, in fact its great and should be encouraged. When this whole flat earth thing started to gain traction and popularity on social media i began to question my own certainty on the shape of the earth and discovered that i really wasn't sure whatsoever. Im now fairly certain that its round thanks to the work of the skeptics whom you claim dont answer the questions of flat earthers. Which they most certainly do, i recommend such youtubers as Wolfie6020 SlySparkane DazzaTheCameraMan Soundly and RedsRhetoric. Your comment has led me to believe that you havent watched much of this content. Regarding your last part about evidence supporting the globe. You are simply mistaken, and thats perfectly okay. I think youve probably been the victim of Flat Earth Youtube Charlatans who are benefiting of the newest pseudoscience fad and its not your fault. There is a tremendous preponderance of evidence supporting the fact that the earth is indeed round. No need for NASA or any pictures from space. None. 

I encourage you to doubt everything including widely accepted facts, but peddlers of conspiracy theories do much more than this. They fabricate narratives of their own and connect invisible dots that have no business being connected. They look at the equidescent projection UN Map and instead of concluding that its a nice way to fit all world countries on to a 2D shape they conclude that it must be the actual shape of the earth and the UN knows and they're rubbing it in our faces

If youre interested in discovering the overwhelming evidence that supports the round earth id be delighted to have a conversation with you regarding it

Im reminded of a quote by the great Carl Sagan who said “In the way that scepticism is sometimes applied to issues of public concern, there is a tendency to belittle, to condescend, to ignore the fact that, deluded or not, supporters of superstition and pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings, who, like the sceptics, are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role in it might be. Their motives are in many cases consonant with science. If their culture has not given them all the tools they need to pursue this great quest, let us temper our criticism with kindness. None of us comes fully equipped.”

Have a great day fellow human !"
">I don't know that I'd say it that way--this isn't about some kind of fairness doctrine, balance doesn't need to be forced through on anyone. Balance is inevitable though unless Sorkin really is just engaging in a circle jerk for the benefit of a liberal audience.

I do agree that Occupy has potential to be addressed and for Sorkin to give it to the democrats as Jon Stewart occasionally does, but unfortunately, based on what I saw throughout the first season, I think MAcAvoy might make a wise crack or 2, but will probably give us an on air speech asking us why the Tea Party couldn't be as founded in great principles as Occupy, or some shit like that. 

>Whether or not the Tea Party can be argued to be more or less successful than the Occupy Wallstreet crowd is immaterial, the fact remains that in season two Occupy Wallstreet will be the focus simply because it's what happened.

Again, that is assuming he decides to pick that story to go after. I honestly think he cannot avoid the wisconsin Scott Walker union busting, but how much do you want to bet we will hear about how instrumental unions have been to this country, with zero talk about the wisdom of public sector unions? Not saying those are my arguments, but based on my experience with the show, MacAvoy will take every opportunity to play Olbermann and expose their hypocrisy, without ever lifting a finger to defend his party or question the opposition party, except through a few token comments. 

I hope you are right and I am wrong though.

>I disagree. Do I wish there was more exposition on how exactly Will McAvoy is a conservative and how he champions those conservative solutions to issues he covers on the news? Absolutely! I think it's important to consider though that at this point in the series (only up to episode six for me) McAvoy is still somewhat reeling from feeling that his party has been taken over and so his focus has been on that and his television career and so we don't see much political conservatism from him in his ""off camera"" time.


>I'm really expecting that to change in season two or I'll be very disappointed.

I kept waiting and waiting for it to change. It does not. It really really really would make a difference if he had almost anything to back up his assertion that he is a republican. Because the way I see it, I'm not sure how anyone with his viewpoint could continue to call themselves a republican with the way he views the party. It just ends up sounding like a cheap excuse that supposedly gives him more credibility than Keith Olbermann to take them to task. 

>Huh? No way! That's not the message I'm seeing at all!
>The message I'm seeing is that the conservatives are being told their party has been invaded and hijacked, just like in the 60's the Democrats suffered something like that. I'm seeing a heroic attempt to shift public opinion by telling people the facts and showing them just how they're being treated like mushrooms.
>Once season two kicks off I'd imagine we're going to see Will McAvoy cracking jokes to those who gave him a hard time about his sudden liberalism and asking them how they feel about the Occupy Wallstreet crowd. I expect to see his conservatism highlighted more then against the backdrop of the more radical and liberalized Occupy Movement.
>Otherwise, I'll have to admit you're right and I will not be watching season three.


Put yourself in the reverse situation. Lets say it was a show about a newsroom full of conservatives and republicans. Lets say they spent all their time taking the worst examples of the democrats and spent all their time telling you, ""Look! Your Party has been taken over by idiots! Now if only you weren't so stupid, you would see that exactly the same was we do, and you would dissavow the party until it is restored to being run by intelligent ""good"" liberals like our lifelong democrat news anchor. Wasn't it great when he spent six episodes talking about the wisdom of the Bush Doctrine, and how we need to cut taxes AND spending now, and how he talked about the need for preemptive strikes against Iran. I mean that is all just common sense. He even said something nice about FDR once, so you know he's a liberal! 

I know a lot of conservatives, many of them very intelligent. It is hard for me to see how they would not be offended by the condescending nature of the show.

The premise of the show is that if you just cut through all the bullshit, we can come together around the truth. Stop picking your own facts and make intelligent choices going forward. This show to me seems like part of the problem. It seems completely uninterested in persuasion, and more interested us all congratulating ourselves with how right we are. There is very little back and forth, very little of the multiple valid viewpoints discussed early on, and too much of head nodding singular truth. Leave that for the talk radio crowd. "
"> In fact, if people keep asking you if it’s your first job, you need to step back and ask yourself what you’re missing that’s causing them to feel that way. It seems to be a pattern with you, so some self-reflection wouldn’t hurt.

Maybe you are right. I did have problems with anxiety in my life. Though, I did improve a lot.

I applied a certain approach... I tried to accept myself and acknowledged that I have a certain type of personality. And I accepted that it's okay to be silent and that you don't have to talk about something all the time. I guess that some people think that ""quiet (or not loud enough) = junior"". And I guess that I feel that people are being condescending way too often. These companies where I experienced this behavior the most, are the ones that treat juniors poorly.

You are not right about this thing. I usually don't come on too strong. I realized that the slow approach is the best approach."

">I feel like secularists tend to mis-characterize religion in really awful ways, particularly in portraying the faithful as incapable of independent thought and beholden to religious ideology. But people tend to project their personal views on their faith, not vice versa. Religion is a social construct; it reflects the ideas of the people who follow it, and is malleable on both the institutional and personal level. Change the people and you will change their religion. 

You couldn't have said it any better. People tend to forget that religion is reflective of the values of the people who practice it, rather than it creating the values of the people. In most cases it is this way; the problem emerges when fundamentalists reverse the role of religion, making it the final measurement of values, rather than adjusting religion to the new values the people come to accept. The fundamentalist view ends up leading to a society that adheres to archaic value systems that have been proved to be flawed. Solving this is seemingly simple: prevent people from becoming fundamentalists and teach them values that are genuine. 

Then, new problems are created: what is a genuine value (EDIT: Ok, i guess that should be obvious)? How do we explain how these values are beneficial without being condescending towards the people? How do we avoid any attempts of cultural imperialism (telling or forcing the people to abandon their culture, because theirs is somehow ""flawed"", and take up a new one)? Then, I asked, what does constitute cultural imperialism? This is mainly food for thought, really. "
"> Turns out, not the case with animals or humans. If energy in lowers, energy out will lower as the body tries to keep the total change in energy the same.

That is correct, but you are trying to extend that limited mechanism of the body to try to stave off starvation into some kind of law. In the end there is no way to put on weight when it is not being fed in. At the extreme end of that equation, yes the law of thermodynamics does absolutely overwhelm any self preservation mechanism the body has.

If you can describe the metabolic pathway in which more energy is stored than consumed I would love to see it.

>The fix I would offer to change the obesity epidemic would be to regulate the fast food industry and force them to sell healthier foods 

Because it's so much better to treat people like children who can't make their own responsible decisions. The good options already exist and rather than educating people to make better choices, you want to legislate away the options you don't like. We clearly are going to disagree on much more than just nutrition.

> Just telling people they're fucking lazy is not a fix

It's a shit load better than legislating the micromanaging of their diets. Calling them lazy might sound mean but it's really a tough love, thinking you have the right to legislate someones food choices is just flat out self righteous and condescending.

>Obviously since obesity is increasing something has changed in the country. And I imagine it's probably not that laziness has gone up.

Yes, we eat more and crappier. It's not a difficult problem to pinpoint. I would indeed characterize laziness as one aspect of it, at least in regards to managing ours diets. We used to cook, we now opt for the easy way out (that's some the lazy part in case you missed it) and that results in eating crap.

I want to get people to do what's good for them by telling them to get their heads out of their asses and realize that they have the power to do it, but in the end I respect them enough to let them make their own decision. I can only hope you hold no official of office of note.

What do you mean by ""original dude""? In what sense was Roxas one of the original characters? What does that mean?

The placing of ""but then"" here makes no sense. Sora has who's heart? His own heart or Roxas' heart? Sora has his own heart. Roxas has no heart since he is Sora's body and soul.

The placing of ""so"" here makes no sense. Roxas is Sora's Nobody. What's confusing about that?

Yup. A Nobody is half of a person. It's their body and soul to be specific. So, Roxas has some of Sora's memories. Which part of that is confusing?

Yes.

">It appears you argue that it has nothing to do with gaining actual advantage.

""Advantage"" is a pretty nonspecific word.

Privilege is defined by barriers to gaining and maintaining political and economic power, and is previous to actually gaining and maintaining political and economic power.

In other words, a white man living in a trailer park who makes $15k a year still experiences privilege, despite the fact that he is not a white man living in a mansion who makes $2 billion a year, insofar as if he wished to improve his economic and political position he would face fewer barriers to doing so than a woman in identical circumstances.

>That it's disadvantageous to society to have a primarily male uh...shadow? to it's political and economic design?

I think most feminists (myself included) would argue that privilege is a morally repugnant structure in and of itself.

>As your example, Citizens united, you could state that there is a ""coporate privilege, no?

I think you're getting ""privilege"" and ""power"" confused (not meaning to be condescending).

>Your setting up a target, a figurehead, in this case men, to be something you can target and proverbially shake your fist at.

Every moral system begins with a necessarily assumed moral imperative. If you don't agree with the necessarily assumed moral imperative, you won't be convinced by the arguments of feminists.

I think most feminists would argue that their necessarily assumed moral imperative is something like, ""In all morally significant ways, society ought to give all people equal opportunity with respect to factors of their birth"".

Feminists further diagnose the source of gender-based inequality: patriarchy.

Patriarchy is defined as the majority of power being held by men. It is worth noting that this does not mean all men, but that the majority of power rests in the hands of men rather than women. Ninety percent of the wealth in the US, for example, is held by 1% of the population, almost all of which is made up of white men.

From this imbalance of political and economic power (again intersecting with capitalism, as where nearly all media outlets are controlled by six mega-corporations) springs privilege - the placement of barriers to political and economic power in the path of non-whites and non-men - from which patriarchy springs, from which privilege springs, and so on in an indefinite cycle.

It should be further noted that this does not ignore the fact that every gender is subject to confining gender roles, nor that certain women may in certain contexts be in positions of power over certain men.

But feminism, to simplify things greatly, claims that problems of gender are primarily the result of patriarchy, and focuses its efforts on destroying said."

"> Difference is that Scarecrow was already introduced in a previous film where he was basically a henchman for Al Ghul. Thus we see him in TDK for the sake of continuity, but doesn't affect the big picture of the film as a whole, thus not distracting it.


A villain's a villain.

If we go by what you're arguing, however, then technically TASM2 only has 2 as well -- Electro and Harry, mostly because Rhino doesn't add anything substantial nor take away anything. He's simply there to give Spidey a good introduction at the start of the film and give Spidey closure at the end of the film with embracing being a hero once more. Hardly distracts the film in my eyes.


Electro was marketed as the main villain, but the marketing also made the film out to be this battle royale that saw Spidey vs. a trio that would help comprise the Sinister Six. If we take the film's true intentions at face value, however, it could also be argued this was Harry Osborn's story more than anything. Electro could be seen as the environmental villain with Harry being the true villain when all is said and done. After all, he's the one who ended up hurting Peter the most and the working title of TASM2 was originally ""Sins of the Father"", connecting Peter and Harry by the ways of their deceased Dads.

> His motivations to hate Spider-Man were purely out of rage, but even then it's stupid how he suddenly turns on Spider-Man. 


You argue they were stupid where I argue they were very simplistic. Thin, sure, but easy to get. Max Dillon as a character was established as a loner and a nobody (also a bit off). Nobody would care if Max fell off the face of the Earth. He got the recognition he wanted from Spider-Man the moment he was saved from the taxi and became enamored with him because it was the first time anyone really took notice of him in more than a condescending/useless way because Spidey specifically referred to him as ""His Guy"".


When he becomes Electro, he becomes noticed by news networks, people in Times Square and is on the jumbo tron. He finally has what he wants..until Spider-Man shows up and in Max's twisted psyche he believes Spider-Man was just using him, hence why he calls him selfish before he loses his mind and almost turns Times Square into a warzone.


>Harry's is stupid as well. His dad dies at an old age, and Harry is like what, 20? He could wait and take time to find a cure.


Of course he could've, but the keyword in it is dying and he was desperate. He specifically tells Peter when he begs him to get Spidey to help him that he doesn't want to end up like his Dad, who suffered an unknown amount of time before dying a miserable death. Why wait? Anyone who is suddenly dying wants to stop it right then and there, no matter how much time they may have. It was a very human response and one I commend the film for.


> He could have said ""Spider-Man I ain't a dunce, we'll test your blood so it can be safe for me. I own a billion dollar science company anyways."" But he was a dunce, because he never even considered his resources.


Again, he was desperate and also had a billion dollar company thrusted on him with no actual plans in mind. Desperation makes people react in ways they wouldn't normally. As proven later on anyway, Spider-Man's blood was going to turn him into The Goblin no matter how much testing they could've did.


> Meanwhile, the Dark Knight has motives that are far more stronger. For the majority of the film, Harvey Dent is a hero, a guy trying to do the right thing. Through that pursuit, he gets hurt, and finally cracks, destroying everything he did that helped the city because he lost faith in it.

> The Joker, however, has unknown motives. And we're not supposed to know them. He's a face of evil we can't understand, and we're not supposed to. He just burns everything and continues to do so because he seems to enjoy the chaos.

"I agree with most of your comment, just wanted to point one thing out...

"> As I said before, those are details. ;) The foundational concept is concrete is non-controversial;

If those are details I'd be scared to see what you considered a big deal! ;-) I specifically mentioned the Bohr-Einstein debates because they centered not on details but on the bigger determinism question which was as much driven by Einstein's emotional attachment than it was different views of details. 

But you're right: one person's detail is another person's life pursuit. The round and round we went attempting to detail god's core attributes without being able to agree on whether they are foundational or not is another good example. 

> Speaking as a reformed creationist

Ah, I should have known you were using it facetiously. Apologies if I was condescending. 

As I was reading through your reply I was thinking of various specific points to respond. However I felt like we were getting off the main point too much and was thinking of a way to try and pull it back. Your question of: 

> what is equivocation?

is probably as good as any. I think the definition you original gave is sufficient: 

> a key term or phrase in an argument is used in an ambiguous way, with one meaning in one portion of the argument and then another meaning in another portion of the argument

I've bolded the portion which I think is key. The point that equivocation happens inside of the same argument not from argument to argument. 

A pantheist is not participating in the broader overall god discusion/argument necessarily (the individual might be however I don't see anything in the definition which requires it). In fact, I think you could view pantheism as a method of removing the god discussion from that broader argument thus allowing that person to rationally believe in god's existence without any need to depart from empirical rationality. Pantheism can be viewed as the easy cure for theistic induced cognitive dissonance. I think I can get why some would identify as pantheists from an emotional perspective.

I would argue your example with the sock isn't technically equivocation either. There's only a single concrete definition posited. You can certainly claim (and be correct) that it's a vacuaous definition but at no point was a different definition of god put forth other than the sock. 

To hopefully further elucidate my position here's an attempt at using equivocation in a slightly more formal form: 

 Definition of thing T - has attribute A
 Definition of thing T' - does not have attribute A

Argument: This thing exists! (can explicitly or implicitly state T is being discussed however most of the time equivocation happens when it's implicit since people tend to make the mistake less when being explicit)

Counter: Show that anything with attribute A can't exist.

Counter-counter: Show T' doesn't have attribute A, original argument stands. 

I still can't see how pantheism's definition suffers from equivocation. It's meaningless. It has no explanatory power. To your point it should be shed as an unnecessarily and overly complex abstraction of reality. However, I simply don't see where you can say that pantheism's definition is intrinsically equivocal without also extending that same accusation to every other definition of god.

Bingo. I've wondered that more than once these last years. I guess it is an inherent problem inside feminism and also a low-key double standard. They want less focus on men and their bonds with other men and less ""mansplaining"" and ""mangst"" and more focus on the women and their friendships...and then they do that when that very same thing is given.

"> The irony here is that most mathematicians abide by some sort of realism - they feel that they're discovering truths, not constructing them.

I wonder if there could be a third choice. If you consider a two sticks laying near each other by chance:

||

And you give it a label, does that indicate you created the number ""2"" in other than the sense of classifying or labeling something or that ""2"" already existed? However you look at it, there could be a stick next to another stick whether or not anything ever saw it or existed that could think about mathematics or numbers.

I hope this doesn't seem condescending again. In a way, it's very simple concepts. But it's also extremely hard to articulate things at such a basic level, since the concept of | + | = || and || + | = ||| is something that I really just take for granted.

I guess I would think the ideal of mathematics as a useful model in how it can correlate with observable things is what makes the most sense to me. Labeling that ""constructing a truth"" or ""discovering a truth"" doesn't seem right to me because it isn't actually a truth, it's just a correlation. It isn't actually connected to the thing it's trying to model.

This viewpoint may seem pretty stupid. I don't actually have any formal education on this (or anything else, to be honest).

> trying to give mathematics its proper status while adhering to materialism is a difficulty.

I guess that would depend on what you think ""proper status"" represents.

> For example, the Aristotelian route: Mathematics is an abstraction of reality, and reality itself is ultimately beyond our knowledge except through abstractions. Voila, all of science still works, but we have to let go of physicalism nonetheless.

This sounds fairly similar to the ""mathematics as a useful tool based on correlation"" sentiment I expressed before, assuming that the terms you're using have the obvious meanings and not any domain-specific ones that I am unfamiliar with. Though I suppose some interpretations of ""abstraction"" could imply a more intimate connection than correlation.

As for your other points: it has always been my contention that the real purpose of MAM was an examination of the justice system, and how it can, and does, sometimes fail. It's why they began with SA's exoneration in the 1985 case, pointing up how and why he was convicted. And it's why they show how the investigation was done -- or not done -- in the 2005 case. It's why they show W&F's interrogations of BD. And, finally, despite what he thinks, it's why they showed KK's own fall from grace. Their point, throughout, is that our justice system, as beautifully designed and perfect as it is, is only as good as those we elect and hire to administer it. If we have corrupt agencies, we may get unjust sentences. If we have corrupt and/or careless and/or unprincipled individuals, we get interrogations such as BD's, including those held not at law enforcement locations, but at resorts, where the recording equipment just happened to fail. 

People can and do argue that MAM was a documentary to show ""SA is innocent...AGAIN"". I think it is a look at justice...and injustice....and the system of justice....and much depends on those we've entrusted to represent it...and us. "

"> and the inertia of the yo-yo. 

It's ""weird"" because you claim it doesn't exist, yet you just described it yourself. Centrifugal force is an inertial force. It's fictitious in that it only exists in the rotational frame of reference from which it is observed, but that makes it no less real. It is the force of inertia resisting a change in the state of motion of the body to which it belongs.

If you look at your example there is something missing. You describe the pull of the string as a force, but you insist that the pull of the yo-yo on the string is not one. You describe a force without the equal and opposite force that must also exist. If you insist that there is no such thing as centrifugal force then you are contradicting Newton's third law of motion (as well as the other two).

The claim that centrifugal force is a myth is the myth. It's just something people say in order to sound quirky or sciency-cool or for shock value or whatever.

It is very much real. It's just that it is only measured in the non-inertial rotational reference frame and not an inertial reference from which the non-inertial is observed. That's relativity.

It is incorrect to say that it isn't real or doesn't exist. It's true that it doesn't originate with 4 fundamental forces/interactions of physics, but that isn't a requirement to be a force.

To be honest, I could argue with you for weeks about this, which I have done before, and you would be no less wrong and me no less right. It's not really worth either of our time. I hate to sound condescending, but you should read more about it instead of just taking ""centrifugal force is fake"" at face value."
"> The title is incredibly sensationalized. They measure the Fermi surface using quantum oscillations, but it is not immediately clear that what they measure is relevant to superconductivity since the high fields required will affect the electronic structure in non trivial ways.

Anyway, I really disagree with your statements. Let's be clear about what we're debating here, though: the measurements clearly support the superlattice theory, and if the measurements are good, then this is really, really convincing evidence that we now understand the underlying theory, which would warrant the ""finally solved"" part of my title. 

Now that this is off of the table, what you're debating is the integrity of the measurements. I'm not the most perfectly qualified individual to try to defend this (theorist who works in a separate topic in phase transitions), and I'm not sure how qualified you are to discuss it either. As such, the word ""could"" takes care of the chance that there are some confounding issues having to do with the experimental design (though I doubt that to be likely due to a large number of experiments which have even confirmed the existence of htsc with magnetic fields there! Not to mention, an RG calculation would probably clear this up no?), which is something you would only consider arguing against a Nature paper if you had some specialized understanding, which is an unfair assumption. That being said, I think you're just being an asshole, the title at least reasonable and you should be shot.

"> Alarmingly realistic, if you're at all familiar with Victorian-era revivalist movements.

Actually, very few were mass-murderers. As someone quite interested in the Victorian period, I always find it irksome how literally modern writers take the caricatures produced by Dickens, Eliot, Collins, etc. Yes, some evangelical revivalists were undoubtedly killjoy hypocrites, but always harping on that angle is tiresome, inaccurate, and terribly condescending to the past.

Then you're a hypocrite. You don't take responsibility for how the animals you eat are raised and slaughtered and yet you condescend to take the moral high ground, (bafflingly) because you don't have the stones to harvest an animal yourself. 

In eating factory meat you are implicated in FAR more animal suffering than that which is produced by hunters. The asymmetry is gobsmacking. The pain and suffering of factory farming in systems like CAFOs is much greater than of the few seconds of pain caused by a hunter. 

Hunters are a necessary part of the system. There are not enough natural predators in the environment to keep prey animal populations in check. A great deal more pain and suffering and ecological damage would be done by ""not"" hunting. These animals have evolved to live in niches which are calibrated to be balanced with predation. 

You take pleasure in eating chicken wings and bacon cheeseburgers without thinking of the indutrialization of pain and suffering required to provide you with this pleasure (you do NOT need to eat meat to survive and certainly not in the quantities that are common to modern people). But you see Bambi in a video and get prissy when actual woodsmen responsibly harvest game.

Alternative explanation: 
It is unlikely that a guy's line causes a change of heart, let alone as a ""main effect"". Reinstating caused them to feel bad upon being condescended on, some associated it with you and decided they'd rather drop you. Some didn't feel bad enough to have to do it, and some did feel like shit but found themselves craving validation and could NOT leave.

You're belittling them in aspects they can't validate with male attention, at least not quickly.

Validation for one's social awareness is harder to get, although I reckon some ways women do it among themselves.

I'd be quicker to say it has more to do with whether or not you tie your personal identity to your political position, and consequently your own validity as a person to the validity of that position. One reason why one might encounter fewer emotional members when discussing amongst like-minded people is that you're not actually conflicting with one another and challenging each other's viewpoints as much.

I think the members of the ancap community who arrived at the philosophy through pragmatism in economics might be less likely to tie their identity to their politics, just because that kind of rationality (the mental arithmetic associated with simply finding the most effective economic solutions) seems like it wouldn't be tied with identity any more than quadratic equations would. Maybe if the person advances the position but truly doesn't understand it they'd be more likely to tie it to their identity (as a ""belief"" rather than practical understanding).

I dunno. Speculation. Food for thought.

Sam Harris has a lot to say on the dangers of religious moderation - specifically because it tends to foster religious extremism. I would tend to agree with him that, in this case, the beliefs themselves can be a problem.

But I try to make a sharp distinction between the beliefs and the believer. I find that most people are pretty reasonable, most of the time. The Creationism-loving, GW Bush-worshipping, gay-hating, nearly-illiterate Christian strawman that gets bandied about a bunch on /r/atheism tends to be fairly far from the truth - certainly it doesn't match any Christian who I've personally known.

And so, for example, stories of children dying due to failed attempts at faith healing are big news because it happens so rarely. Generally, most Christians will head to the hospital when something is wrong - and only after their loved ones are in the hands of trained professionals will they fall back on prayer. In such cases, I would find it condescending and rude to point out to them that prayer will have no empirically measurable affect on the outcome. Certainly, I have my share of irrational habits that they, in turn, are polite enough to ignore.

> If someone thinks there is a god and they can't demonstrate to me why that is the case I will have a problem with that belief.

""_When you record examples of yourself and others getting accused of privilege or mansplaining, and show people the list, and point out that exactly zero percent of them are anything remotely related to 'interrupting women in a women-only safe space' and one hundred percent are 'making a correct argument that somebody wants to shut down', then your interlocutor can just say 'You’re deliberately only engaging with straw-man feminists who don’t represent the strongest part of the movement, you can’t hold me responsible for what they do” and continue to insist that anyone who is upset by the uses of the word 'privilege' just doesn’t understand that it’s wrong to interrupt women in safe spaces.""_"
"> So now you're trying to argue that you become less strong from hitting a punching bag than when getting hit in a fight. 

 No, that's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that every action Freeza was doing while in his Golden form, even attacking Goku, was draining his stamina. That's why, even though Goku wasn't able to do anything in return to Freeza, Freeza's stamina was still burning away.

> And you're also trying to tell me that it was Frieza hitting Goku that made him lose power, even though it was when they were fighting, going right at one another, that Frieza got bested. Also what doesn't make sense is that you're trying to say that Frieza is so much stronger that Goku couldn't do a thing to him, yet in some imaginary way couldn't great deplete Goku's own energy with all those blows. 

 Goku's own stamina is simply better. That's the point that was being made. Freeza was the stronger, but his stamina was abysmal, while Goku was the weaker, yet his stamina was allowing him to keep his strength going despite the damage he was taking.

 It's no different than Ssj3 Goku fighting Buu at the end of Z. Ssj3 burned through Goku's ki at an excessive rate, and while he was the stronger by a small degree, his attacks weren't able to deplete Buu's stamina as fast as his own was depleting. 

> The quote is saying what it is saying, and what it isn't saying is that there was any time limit

 The moment that Freeza landed his punch on Goku's face that he tanked effortlessly, he specifically called out that Freeza had reached his time limit, and then goes on to explain precisely what had happened; that his Golden Freeza form was too inefficient in terms of stamina drain, and why he eventually became weaker than Goku.

 Goku would have lost if Freeza's stamina hadn't dropped when it did, and stamina is tied to strength. There is no other way that line can be taken other than Freeza was the stronger before the stamina drain took its toll on him.

 I don't mean this in an insulting or condescending way, but are you possibly getting the battle from the movie mixed up with the battle from the episode? The way you keep describing the fight fits what was shown in the movie, with Freeza and Goku being fairly equal and Goku's attacks being appreciable (while also not having those scenes of Freeza laying Goku out on the ground repeatedly). The episode though clearly shows Freeza being the dominant one throughout the whole thing up until his stamina completely dropping."

> Right, and thus stating that someone whose views many consider...unhelpful and motivating unconstitutional policies is preferable.

This to me appears to go exactly the opposite way of what I said in the part you quoted. Sam's not making a case for Carson, he was merely trying to show the scale of Chomsky's error on that specific issue (as he sees it of course) by using a relatable current event (the primaries). If you want to bring in the totality of the real world into this hypothetical, as you seem to (an absolute hypothetical because that choice is nowhere near an actual possibility), then also enter into your equation that Sam is once again voting for the democratic candidate and is vocally and forcefully critical of the republican one, even though he's the most explicit on the jihadist problem. I mean you and many other critics on this topic seem to act as if Sam was/is actually for Carson, not merely using this hypothetical as a rhetorical device.

> What does ""Chomsky is extra special"" even mean?

It was a simple shorthand for people bringing up all of his undeniable qualities and achievements as a counter argument to Sam's hypothetical. And as I said and maintain these qualities do no work against Sam's point, because they do not help Chomsky one bit (in this hypothetical) if he's wrong on the issue at hand, as Sam thinks he is. It is a straight forward appeal to authority - a logical fallacy.

Regarding all the rest you bring up I think and hope I can adequately explain it thus:
There's two levels in this issue. First is Sam right about Chomsky and the importance/nature of the jihadist problem (I think there's no dispute necessary that he's right about Carson in that he recognizes the jihadist problem) and second what is the rational position if he is.

To discern whether Sam is right on Chomsky and the importance/nature of the problem, Carson plays absolutely no role, because nothing hinges on him. If Sam is right however, then his hypothetical makes sense and he's making a rational choice.

Which essentially means that all the criticism, lampooning of Harris that focuses on Carson's merits vs Chomsky's is meaningless at best. One can have a meaningful and reasonable discussion whether Sam is right, but as I said that debate doesn't involve Carson, nor does it warrant a condescending dismissal of Harris. IOW Sam said nothing new with this specific hypothetical, as he was openly saying way before that where in his opinion Chomsky is wrong. This was just a rewording of his known position and people jumped on it as if it was something ridiculous for no really valid reason, as I hopefully adequately explained."

I 100% agree there. Most people regardless of nationality are pretty great, but those experiences definitely stick with you. I actually have heard a lot of great things about the Balkans including Serbia. I really want to visit. 

I have noticed most of the condescending comments tend to come from Western Europeans or Canadians (some Canadians make a full time job out of differentiating Canada from the US). I went to Kurdish Iraq a couple years ago and had great conversations with people form Baghdad, Mosul, Kirkuk, etc. Not one held my nationality against me. But a girl from Vancouver flipped out for me ""pretending"" to be Canadian when I didn't immediately tell her I was not from Toronto like the other people in the group (this was during a different trip, did not meet too many tourists in Iraq haha). Seems like if someone from Baghdad can look past the passport in my pocket someone form Vancouver should be able to as well.

I even had a CEO come up to me and a coworker right before our biggest client came into the office. I was working on simple bug fixes at the time and she was working hard on some marketing work she usually does. The office was a little dirty and he wanted to run the vacuum. Instead of asking me, who he knew was doing very simple work that could easily be put off for 5 minutes of cleanup time, he asked my coworker and proceeded to say ""Its not because you are a woman but.... you know?"" in a very condescending tone. 

Stuff like this really bums me out. It makes me ashamed for the state that things are in the CS field. It makes me worried for the few female classmates in my major because I know they are going to experience things like this.

It wasn't that he thought the people weren't qualified. He wanted the people to be involved in the election process but he rationalized that a popular vote would be abused and that it would also negate the voice of those states with less population or different demographics.

Yes...Which is what I have stated previously. It's also interesting to note:

Madison’s fear – which Alexis de Tocqueville later dubbed “the tyranny of the majority” – was that a faction could grow to encompass more than 50 percent of the population, at which point it could “sacrifice to its ruling passion or interest both the public good and the rights of other citizens.” Madison has a solution for tyranny of the majority: “A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking.”

This is exactly what you see with parts of the East Coast & West Coast being heavily populated and leaning Democratic while the rest of the country is leaning Republican but the population is spread out.

You're right...It's not democratic. It's a democratic-republic.

Actually...That's basically what a democracy is. The people have a voice in their government.

But since the United States is a democratic-republic, meaning that the people don't have a direct voice in their government but elect representatives to represent them in the government.

Everyone knows that, or should at least.

I understand your reasoning on why political cartoons are a bad starting point, I just think they have their place in discussions. Banning them outright seems like an overreaction.

Smells a lot like ""free speech zones,"" IE a ghetto where things are put to be ignored. You made an excellent point about Ptoons being a bad starting point for discussions, but I think the same logic applies here. In my experience most articles that discuss politics directly focus on the celeb/tribal aspects of it which is explicitly not where I want the discussion to focus. Saying you can break the rule on Saturdays simply says we will have bad starting points most of the time and sounds like a condescending nod to vanity and narcissism.

"> patronising!

well, what are your credentials? since when do you play this game? how often did you reach legend? how many decks do you play? how often do you play? what's your normal season rank finish? do you watch top level streamers? or maybe you are a top level streamer? how many other competetive games have you played? how deep into those games metagames have you went into?

By your posts I'm betting you are a beggining to intermediate level player. Hence the patronisation.

I can tell you, that something works somehow, if I know the matter better than you, but I don't have to offer an explanation. Especially not in the era of google, when you can very well do your own research.

Even better, I pointed you to some places where you can grab some knowledge.

>there are always going to be classes that are more powerful than others. So why is that? Well, because they have better cards, that’s why.

See... there's where you are wrong, at the very first sentence.

Try this mental experiment: imagine a card pool, where all the hearthstone's tier S decks are available in their prenerf states. Undertaker Hunter, Patches Aggro Shaman, KFT Jade Druid, KaC Razakus, KFT Aggro Druid, Patron Warrior, KaC Tempo Rogue, early Miracle Rogue, Quest Rogue, Thaurisan Combo Druid (barely makes the cut). That's 6 classes and 10 decks with extremelly potent decks. Warlock, Mage, Paladin don't make the cut, since they all get countered by too many of these things.

So now you start pitting these decks against eachother on ladder, and it will soon become apparent, that some decks counter other decks. Some decks have more counters than others, some counter more things than others. And so on. Soon:

- KaC Razakus priest would be dropped from the meta, since it would lose miserably against most of these decks.

- Combo Druid would only have 1 good matchup, vs Razakus, so it would soon be dropped as well.

- Quest Rogue might hang in there for a while, because Patron is cleaning up aggro decks. But soon people go back to aggro decks anyways, because those always have that highrolly potential to win a game by turn 4. Thus Quest Rogue is dropped from the meta...

- Tempo Rogue seems to be doing well against all of these decks, so it remains in the meta

- Jade Druid is able to fight off aggro, but loses miserably against Patrons and Miracles, it's also not very good against Tempo Rogue, so even this powerhouse deck gets dropped from the meta. Some people pull it out when there is a lot of aggro (if they are not proficient with Patrons).

- Aggro Druid has those turn 3-4 wins, so it remains.

- Aggro Shaman -- similarly to Aggro Druid.

- Undertaker Hunter -- aggro deck with the ability to go long, will surely find a spot in the meta.

- Miracle should be able to kill the slower decks, but doesn't have a very good matchup against Aggro decks, so it is only pulled out when there's Jades and Patrons.

Even with all the bestest of best decks available -- you end up with a metagame consisting of 3 aggro decks, 1 tempo rogue, patron warrior, and sometimes jade druid. That's 5 to 6 decks out of initial 10. (Obviously, I have never seen how most of these decks fare against eachother, and I'm just theoretizing, but the particulars don't matter for this example to still be valid, as it is a mental excersize)

That's how metagames work -- only the strongest survive. And not what is strongest in a vacuum, but what is strongest in the actual meta. Even though these classes have some of the most broken cards available to them. Corridor Creeper, Thaurisan, Raza/Anduin/Kazakus, Loatheb, 4 mana Leeroy, charging Patches, 1/2 Buccaneer, 1 mana Spirit Claws, 4 mana 7/7, 1 mana execute, 2 mana Owl, 2/4 Keeper of the Grove, Force-Roar combo, charging Patrons and Frothings, Innervates giving 2 mana, 5 mana Plague...

All bonkers cards. Yet somehow these cards end up canceling eachother out. By the sheer nature of the game, where cheap AOE counters aggro, Aggro counters Midrange, Control counters Aggro, Midrange counters combo (all with exceptions). This means that naturally some decks will become more popular than others, while some end up being completelly dropped.

The same thing happens in nature with animals and plants -- if two creatures attempt to occupy the same niche, one of them will become more succesful and push the other out. Even though they are part of the same structure and have access to all the same tools. (Obviously this example doesn't exactly translate to HS, but it is close enough).

In other games, similair stuff happens. Chess ends up being wildly about the same few openings, in Football the strongest teams pressure other teams to play in a certain manner. And so on.

>The simple reason for this is that near enough all shaman class cards in the last 2 xpacs were trash.

If they would be not trash -- Shaman would still be pushed out of the meta by Priest.

Sure, some classes end up getting the best cards. But it's because you can only release so many good cards, until they start cancelling eachother out to the point of pushing out some classes out of the meta.

>Just poor design.

That's what triggered my condescending tone -- when someone with poor knowledge on a matter makes such strong and definitively sounding statements about it. You should be more humble in your opinions on this matter, since your knowledge is so clearly lacking. And then you have the audacity to call me out on my patronizing tone, indirectly claiming that you have sufficient knwoledge and experience.

There is nothing wrong in discussing stuff even at a beginner's knowledge -- but it is always important to be aware of the state of your knowledge. Have you heard of Dunning Kruger effect? Check it out on wiki...

>And yet Shaman cards from the same xpac have next to no synergy and have thus seen very little play.

The synergy might come in future expansions.

Take a look at how Blizzard releases cards. First they print some random stuff, allowing a class to go in various directions. Then they observe how those ends up working out. Once they have seen enough of it in the actual metagame, they know what other tools the deck is lacking. So they decide if they want to print support for that. Sometimes their new stuff ends up being outright good and picked up in the first release. Sometimes it takes a few more expansions (shaman: Trogg, and Totem Golem, and 4 mana 7/7 were all available for a very long time before shaman has risen to tier S, because it was still lacking the ability to ping stuff, which was granted to them with Portal and Claws).

Similarly Sludge Belcher got printed -- there was an obvious gap in the early-mid game defense, but it needed to be seen on ladder.

Yes, they test cards, and they are pretty good at it. But they still have very limited resources, since the team consists of 4 people. So there is only as much as they can do.

>there should never be a situation when one class is so dumpster it doesn’t see play at all.

We currently have a meta where no class is dumpster tier. Don't know how long this will last. But hopefully they are on the right road to figure out what cards not to print so that some classes end in the dumpster. Still there will be many more metagames with 1-2 dumspter classes, and I think that is fine.

Although there will always be a huge gap between the popularity of the top class against the bottom class.

>Also, saying that all cards being good makes all cards bad is kind of a moot point isn’t it? If all cards are bad then aren’t all cards also good?

Yes, that is the point. Either way -- some cards will end up countering other cards. Thing is -- if all cards are similarly good/bad, the game is probably extremelly boring, because there is no wacky shit running around.

>You seem like an intelligent enough guy so understand this. I am offering opinions. Opinions can’t be true or false. So whilst yours may differ from mine, that doesn’t make you correct in your assertions. I get that you are clearly deeply in love with HS, so I can understand why you’re so defensive of it.

Nice try. While all of us are entitled to their opinions, it doesn't mean that we are neither correct or wrong. Opinions on such things are either correct or wrong.

We are both trying to state our educated opinions on matters that we don't have full data about. But it seems, that my opinion has better background, than yours, since I buffer a lot of information about the metagame.

"> Again, I think you need a dictionary. How big is ""too big"" is absolutely subjective.

You don't need to be a dick, chill. I can make condescending comments about how no you! should look a dictionary but that gets us nowhere.

What I meant, is that it's not subjective that there are smaller and lighter guns with the same capacity as the P239. If your girl wants to carry a big gun, that's fine, but carry a Glock 26 or M&PC which hold more rounds and are generally 'better' guns for the same form factor, or a smaller and lighter gun with the same capacity, ie firepower.

> They're also significantly harder to shoot well. Its his first pistol. If he's going to carry it, he needs to practice and become proficient. The P239 is going to be more conducive to lots of good practice. And for plenty of people, its still eminently concealable

I wouldn't say significantly harder to shoot, but yes any gun that's easier to carry is going to be harder to shoot... The issue is that you can get more firepower for the same size and platform as the P239. If you think the XDS and Shield are too small, unwieldy to fire (really?), fine, there's the Glock 26, M&PC, SR9C, etc.

> These are you opinions. Stop acting like they're facts.

There are logical reasons to choose one pistol over another. I haven't really seen you bring up any. Like I said, if you are really preferential to the feel of a Sig, as in you've used multiple firearms for long periods of time and have developed this fine taste through years of experience, I totally get it. But if you are a new firearm user, it would be kinda silly to go for the P239 over other options unless you really felt the other options were uncomfortable and unwiedly.

>The LGBT community isn't on the cusp of gaining marriage equality because they were polite. They are successful, because they have managed to stigmatize being a homophobe.

I think it's far more likely that they are successful due to their coming out campaign that informed the public that many of their friends and loved ones are gay. This forces people to resolve their cognitive dissonance (i.e. the conflict between hating gay people and loving their loved ones). I've seen it multiple times in my own life, where even the staunchest conservatives who will entrench and fight liberal ideas nevertheless turned an about face on homosexual rights for personal reasons.

Or to put it another way: Bad example.

>Atheists are more accepted today than in the past, and it isn't because we've been quiet and polite. It's due to aggressively putting the position out there and demanding a place at the table.

Yeah, I don't think that's true at all. I think atheists are more accepted because they have been coming out more, much like homosexuals. The stereotype of the angry, petty, condescending atheist continues to hobble us in conversations even today. By and large, I don't think atheists fit that stereotype, and I don't think that a ""gloves off"" assessment of the faults and failures of religion is rude. What I do think hurts our image is people who level their scorn and derision at the theists rather than at the ideas.

>It's been established that politely trying to educate your audience is very ineffective, and may even backfire and reinforce the belief or behavior you are trying to change.

You have it precisely backwards. The backfire effect is a consequence of confrontation. When you challenge a belief, even with evidence, people tend to entrench and believe it more strongly. Are you seriously arguing that the backfire effect would be lessened if we challenged the belief even more stridently by peppering our argument with ad hominem attacks?

Also, as an aside, I'd like to point out that we are both arguing entirely on the basis of intuitions, and yet the entrenchment is already becoming abundantly clear.

So let me ask you. Do you think we're entrenching less in our views for the abrasive tone of this discussion or more?"

Yaroberto has shown multiple times how poor his communication skills are. He makes rash decisions in less thoughtout broken english without thinking about how that effects the image of the site. Remember the time he banned the Lounge-Plugin? He called it a phishing attempt, put up a vague message about ""banning"" users and banned tw8 and any threads on it (seem familiar?). He made little if any attempt to reach the creator or talk with the users about it. There is little transparency with the guy.

Patronizing tone aside, I think this subreddit owes no apology. There are some bad users that have done some bad things but Yaroberto is far from innocent.

"> OK, by ""hard"" polytheism I mean the curious insistence on the ""individuality"" of gods and some related notions.

Considering that mythology, which you place so much emphasis on, tends to highlight the gods' individual agency... I dunno where you're going with all this.

Moreover, the belief in individual gods in and of itself does not somehow invalidate other forms of polytheism. My believing in the distinct and individual agency of Seaxneat, compared to Woden, does not somehow mean that henotheistic Egyptian interpretations cannot co-exist or be correct for their own context.

In the same way, there is very little that I have ever seen to suggest that your theology, as you've presented it, is representative of historical Germanic polytheism. By all means, if you believe I'm wrong on this, provide me with some sources.

The theology of Shinto (which you are quite taken with, for whatever reason) isn't really relevant to Heathen theology, which is not inherently relevant to Kemetic theology, which is not inherently relevant to Catholic theology, which is not inherently relevant to Zorastrian theology, which... I think I've made my point, there. 

>I don't substantiate any belief in the gods. I simply recognise their presence in the world.

The recognition of divinity's immanent presence is tantamount to belief in that divinity.

You are, quite literally, the only one actually making the claims that you are taking issue with.

I very genuinely, and I don't mean this condescendingly (in this instance, I've certainly been so elsewhere in this thread and I believe in those instances it was more than justified) do not believe you understand what ""theology"" means.

For example, A man may actually really only want a woman who is completely infatuated with him, who wants him to be the de facto patriarch. He may want a submissive woman as his wife. Another end of the spectrum: A woman may actually want a dominant man who she can rely on and trust. She wants the bad boy she craves to actually settle down with her and remain that guy she had feelings for, while in a solid commitment as well. They can use RP to create that desired equilibrium. RP also says that people, in favour of rejecting roles, adhere too strongly to the role of rejecting roles, and anything for that matter that dares defy the narrative that relationships work on unknowable, universal magic. And as a result, these people can end up unhappy and burned, and they often do at remarkable rates(50% of people in a marraige will be cheated on, similar number divorced, 100% will face heartache and friction, abuse, bullshit, 1-30% of men will suffer misattributed paternity, even when they get along, 50% or more will report they are not really in love, millions of men will pour money and effort into women on misguided, ineffective approaches and suffer terrible self-esteem, millions of women will be spoiled beyond objectively normal by this validation, millions more will make themselves and their man unhappy via their nature, Millions of kids will live with these dysfunctional psychos in irrational relationships, etc, etc). RP is not for everyone, but it can help everyone in getting what they want, by actively allowing themselves to question it, get a feel for what actually works, and try it to their own tastes. It allows people to change their options, through work and allowing themselves to seek unconventional solutions. A decade or so later, you ended up with the manosphere and modern TRP(and a boatload of percieved ""misogyny"" and hatred against modern feminism which we perceive is skewing the sexual market in undesirable ways).

In the skewed market we have, RP allows you to understand what squares you can move to, how to move effectively, and how to play best in your given square. I actually want a naturally submissive woman who I don't have to try very hard with at all. I got half that wish. I ended up with someone I like better. She's not quite as submissive(even dominant sometimes. Which I admit, is a considerable turn off in a woman) but is much more a attractive to me in other ways(i.e. she's smarter than me. Cooperative, outstandingly kind and considerate and infectiously happy). I also defy RP's stances against LTRs and marriage(as I'm in one and planning to), and don't use any (TBP classified anyway) douche-y tactics. I actually write against them, and go around describing dread game(alternative to the TBP cartoony vision of dread) to TBP and challenge them to point out how its abuse. I literally often give people the advice that they should just leave RP and try to make their relationships work as is, with some tl;dr on the advice they need(because they seemed stupid to me and I didn't trust them to apply what they didn't need wrongly). I should be shunned from RP by your standards... but I'm not... 


>I have some self esteem issues (as everyone does) and this made me feel kinda bad, so I would be a lot more quick to point out his mistakes while he was playing than usual to make myself better, and I did it in a much more snappy manner than was necessary... to raise my self esteem.

Standard woman(or human) behaviour(but no, especially women). It doesn't actually raise your self-esteem, it seeks to correct a perceived usefulness/capability disparity. Challenge him, or bring him down. The desire for which initiates shit-test. Key phrase: 

> To soothe that little ache you get in your chest when you feel worse than someone at something.

Exhibit B: 

>It had nothing to do with getting him to be submissive or dominant or whatever, it was completely centered on me and making me feel better. 

Via changing him and targeting his performance(perceived ego disparity). Keep bolded phrase in mind as we go on.

>I didn't care if he responded by saying ""Oh, yeah, you're right... sorry"" or ""Yeah, everyone makes mistakes, like you did a couple minutes ago :p"" (negative or dominant, respectively).

Let me put a theory to you and you tell me how I'm doing. I think the first of those was a shit-test failure outcome. You may be worse at Magic the Gathering but you're still getting qualified to and validated by this man showing you your position is not threatened and that he's under your control and values you highly enough to submit via evidence of love forthwith on the first suspicion you are displeased. The beta becomes submissive and surrenders this lead immediately. 

Let me visualize it though... Imagine this scene as an example: Girl beats boy badly at video game. Boy's ego is hurt and his mood sours. Girl immediately [space reserved] becomes lovey-dovey and soothes his ego with all sorts of assurances and examples of why she still loves and values him to prevent problems. In our example, the fails shit-test actually, but THAT IS A GOOD THING. It is a positive beta trait and a good thing in women generally. Its highly correlated with less relationship problems. An example of non-PC outcomes being better. The variant magnanimity is actually quite alpha and I'll illustrate if you read on.)

>He pointed it out to me, said it hurt him, I did some introspection and realized that's why I was doing it. I told him, and he quickly assured me, soothed my self esteem and my ego with soft words and cuddles and happiness.

I assume he didn't actually burst into tears when he told you, in which case, he qualifies for this popular shit-test defusal template: ""Commanding Respect"" (given in the RP side-bar here). A RPer would say it more or less directly but that'd be the only difference(I think I'd say it quite softly and dispassionately myself). Notice how he also causes you to identify your bad behaviour, make you honest, and then responds to your true needs now... 

...

...

...like a father. How blatant can we get.

Notice how tiny things can turn the shit-test failure from positive beta to alpha(magnanimous). Just insert a ""Laughs it off and"" in the reserved space above and change the delivery of the assurances(for example a subtle and tender ""Why you're valuable to me. instead of valuable in general). Catching my drift? She is still above him but addresses the complaints as well as necessary. Perfect shit-test counter. Magnanimity is not recommended for girls though. Really, picture it in your mind and it gets condescending fast, whereas a girl receiving it from a man wouldn't. A man's ego is generally more paramount to controlling him and keeping him attractive, and far more sensitive IMHO.

>It was not a dominance struggle.

Wasn't it? He just won without you knowing. The definition of RP success. Later he allowed you to lead in and out of the inconsequential stuff. Which is a key component of something RPW go on about when advising men with non-RP GFs i.e. ""Make her feel appreciated, and considered valuable. You take her advice and words deeply into consideration. But the decision still comes from you"". The latter sentence is an example of frame control. Your ""frame of social interaction"" happened to be such that, the end decision ended up to be from you, even if she did the thinking, and actions enabling it. Dominance and submission by definition apply when you are making people do what you want against their natural intentions(or lack of intentions). If I point at a stranger in the street and say ""I am dominating you into walking in a straight line"", that'd be pretty retarded. In the same way, you don't exactly dominate when you put forth a suggestion and its in his mind to agree. You're just participating more, which is a weak form of dominance. The peons chatter and run around more, in comparison to a King. They may even speak for him. They may speak against him. But he still credibly competes in dominance. How? Subtext.

">spoiler tag when necessary

That's exactly the point. Again I reiterate: two years. At some point personal responsibility comes into play. This sub does everything it can to make people aware that the end of the 2011 anime isn't really the end of HxH. But whether it be now or later, at some point people will just be expected to know that the manga has continued, or be forced to deal with the tough luck that they read a spoiler when they weren't aware. We're not getting another anime anytime soon.

As I said in my OP, HxH is in a unique place, but I'd like to draw your attention to /r/DBZ over the past year. When Resurrection 'F' was coming out in theaters we mods did everything in our power to make sure spoilers were hidden. Spoilers weren't allowed in titles, and you had to make it clear in your comment that you were bringing them up.

Months later we found out about Dragon Ball Super and we were in unanimous agreement that we weren't even going to try to keep the atmosphere spoiler-free because in what world is that possible with a weekly series? So we made a rule that spoilers must be hidden for the latest two episodes. All we could do was apologize to those who didn't want to see them period.

My point is: people are going to talk about what's new, and given enough time I think it falls to the ignorant (I don't mean this in a condescending way) to use the very available resources to keep up to speed. The community as a whole should be allowed to discuss the new content without fear of ruining the surprise for someone else."

>It was after coming to believe that I felt the presence of God in the world that I became interested in cosmology, epistemology and ontology, etc...

Now I don't want to sound condescending or anything, but this, to me, sounds that you started feeling the presence of God after you voluntarily went looking for him, which opens one up to confirmation bias, and then on that non-rational basis went on to learn other aspects that would reinforce belief in God.

I'm not saying this because I want to try to make you feel stupid or anything, I want to say this because I would like you to understand my thought process and understand how I reach the conclusions I do.

What you are asking me is essentially ""you can believe in God if you lower your standards"", and frankly, I don't see why I should or why that would be a good idea. God is perfectly able to speak to me right now, knows exactly what to say for me to change my own mind of my own free will, should want to do so if he wants us to have a relationship, and nothing in the world can stop him from doing precisely that.

So why should I have to try to lower my standards, judge what is true by unreliable feelings, and let myself be convinced with sub-standard methods of gaining knowledge? Would an omniscient deity really prefer this method to convince people of its existence?"

If people are willing to gamble here with those odds then more power to you, but I feel like this isn't competitive.""
 

Your math is correct. 6.25% is our house edge. We spent a lot of time researching our competitors and gambling percentages in general. Our games have the lowest house edge of any ""crypto wheel"" games we could find. If you look at casino game percentages you will also see that we beat out most them as well. At 6.25% we sometimes take a beating, we have many big winners all the time. If we found that people were not winning, or if we found people were not having a good time playing our games we would change the percentage. Some people would complain about a .5% house edge. We aren't running a faucet, this is an entertainment service.
 
 
> ""I also have to worry about a site that, from what I can tell, is storing login credentials in the URL (i.e. why does the URL have to warn me not to ever share it? URLs should not be taken to be secure). While we're at it, why is the site not on https? The option to password protect your URL is cute, but there's no protection against brute forcing the password—I just put in a few dozen attempts at guessing a simple password and the site was perfectly content to let me keep on guessing and when I put in the right password it happily let me right on in.""
 

This is a security vs convenience tradeoff. It is the users responsibility to not share their unique URL, which is why he have #DO NOT SHARE in the URL. Your point about brute forcing is valid and we have now added brute force protection to the passwords. It is the users responsibility again to pick a secure password, not ours.

As for the SSL, its funny that you bring that up right now. We had always planned to add SSL, and our launch just happened to come at a time when everyone is doubting the effectiveness of https. We are adding support for it in the next few days. If we added SSL during the heartbleed exploit we would have had to renew the certs again for total security. Many sites have only patched the servers and have not even bothered renewing any certs. Please don't get on your high horse about http, the heartbleed exploit was easier to execute than a plain http attack.

Before the CryptoBetfair umbrella, we were running few similar sites and we had very few support requests, and no customer has ever lost a coin. We are not a bank nor we do encourage holding of big amounts of money on our site. We provide entertainment, and mainly cheap one so I guess that this is an acceptable tradeoff. 

> ""To make the login information even less secure, it's stored as a plaintext cookie from the site. Anyone who manages to get read access to a computer that has played on this site can go find the cookies and look for the one named XPMSPINUID. If the UID was not password protected then that's all that is needed. If it was password protected then it's just a matter of a brute force attack, which is literally one of the easiest attacks to protect against for a web-based password.""
 

Again, you make a fair point, and we have added brute force protection. Lets take a step back here and look at the rest of your security concerns. ""IF"" someone manages to access your computer AND your account is not password protected, yes they could access your account. Isn't that true of every website? We aren't trying to run an online wallet or an exchange. Our games shouldn't be what you think of when you are picking a place for long term storage of your funds. Having said that, we have never lost a single coin of our customers funds, not many places can claim that.
 
You start off with a few valid ""and fixed"" security problems, but then you go into the ""provably fair"" part, and you couldn't be more wrong in this area.
 
You jump all around here. You claim that we don't give enough information. You don't outright call us cheaters but do your best to hint that, and follow that up by suggesting that we are so incompetent that people can waltz in and rob us blind. I read over what you posted above a few times and I think I have addressed all of your issues. We have added brute force protection and ssl is on the way.

We have created a service for XPM and expect a little support from a person who is a moderator of the XPM and Primecoin subreddits. We will take criticism and have done our best to fix these issues but please don’t say things like “Until then I cannot recommend anyone use this site except with money they are planning to lose.” or condescending words like our password protection being ‘cute’. Plenty of user have used our sites over a period of 4 months and not one customer has lost any coins. We are a passionate team of 4, each who have been very active in the crypto community for a long time now.

So on to the provably fair part...

There is no issue with provable fairness at all, I was able to verify it when I saw a similar game for the first time. I admit that it could be clearer. There will be a better explanation and a one click verifier, or something similar. However, I can not hammer it into peoples heads. However clear it is there will be always people who do not read. It could be better in my opinion.

> ""All the code that deals with the randomness of the spins is protected on our server. We have our own algorithm which ensures the spin is random""

What that means is that we use hash based PRNG on the backend and not stdlib rand() or similar which is not secure, i.e. no point in trying to guess server seed. If it was different then it would be at your advantage if you try to guess server seed, we would lose - nothing to do with fairness at all. Also, we commit to the server seed, and we reveal it after you spin. Please have another look. We do not show you the full history only the last spin, because we feel it is unnecessary, and decided to conserve resources. Why? Because we already noticed that many people just complain before they understand, they do not read and there is no point in showing them something that they do not read. 

> I'm also worried that the server seed is not appropriately hidden. I can't see any examples of old server seeds (another red flag, but perhaps this is just due to the fact that the website is too young—I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here), but it appears that it is just a hash of a single number. While computing preimages attacks of modern cyrptographic hash functions is unreasonably difficult it is conceivable to compute a rainbow table of all positive integers up to the ~15 digits that the client seed has (with 1 TB of memory one could expect to have collisions with a fraction of a percent of hashes; the user can get a new hash by getting a new account—fast and almost free—until they get a known hash). Some quick testing shows that the client seed cannot exceed 19 digits. If the server seed is a similar length then this is not enough security to protect against rainbow tables, which could lead to betters bleeding you dry with unreasonably good ""luck.""

Now you are calling our website young, insulting us without knowing anything about us. We have outlasted every other wheel site, most of which haven’t added the security we have to protect ourselves and the users. You are very welcome to guess and drain our wallets if you think betters can come and ‘Bleed us dry’. If you come to our support channel (#cryptobetfair) I will make you a voucher so you can try with my money.

You make false assumptions having only glanced at how things work, then bash us on here before you even ask a question. The server seed changes with every spin. If you take some more time and examine how the system works, I have 100% faith that you will change your opinion.

"Sorry I couldn't get back to this until now. 

>I thought Weinstein was against the policy of telling whites they couldn't be on campus during the ""Day of Absence."" 

This is not quite right. First, the Day of Absence is totally voluntary. White students were not being asked to stay away from campus totally. The thing is that, typically on the Day of Absence, students of color will decline to go to class and meet off-campus to discuss their issues, while white student allies will decline to go to class but meet on-campus. The only difference was that the Director, Rashida Love, wanted to flip it this year to ""[reaffirm] the value of having POC in higher education and specifically at Evergreen."" 

So, she was asking white allies to protest by not going to classes but to be the ones to meet off-campus instead. This was done specifically because some students of color voiced concern about them feeling unwelcome on campus after Trump's immigration orders. They felt that it sent a stronger rhetorical message if they stayed and the white allies went.

Weinstein's comments were, at the very least, tone-deaf and I'd venture to say pretty irresponsible. He came across as condescending to his colleague, completely ignorant of the context and basically made himself look like a jackass. Yes, the students were angry and upset, but in my opinion they had a right to be.

>where the students were confronting Weinstein about his email, one of them said: “We don’t care what terms you want to speak on. This is not about you. We are not speaking on terms — on terms of white privilege. This is not a discussion. You have lost that one.”

Yes. ONE STUDENT said this. Others shouted to listen to him, and others were asking him questions. The ""students"" do not think that ""whites have no voice."" There are 1400 students at Evergreen and they don't have one representative or one opinion on this matter. Your question was misleading and missing the point. 

>Based on that video, it's ok for POC to talk over whites when they try to discuss their own experiences.

Weinstein wasn't just discussing his own experience. He was discussing how best to deal with racial issues on campus, from an ignorant and privileged perspective. 

>That tells me I have no right to empathize unless I am a POC.

Of course you have the right to empathize! You just shouldn't tell students of color who are protesting how best to do their protest because it's not about you. 

One other thing I want to add--The students were trying to get Weinstein to understand their position and he used his ""authority"" as a professor as a cudgel. It was ill-done and shameful (I speak as a professor. I think he shouldn't have spoken to them the way he did.) I think a lot of the outrage over them shouting him down is the perception that they owed him respect because he is a professor. But his way of communicating with them (and with Love) was highly disrespectful. And part of protesting is refusing to be cowed by authority and, in fact, flouting the authority of the state, white supremacist powers and other apparatuses of oppression. In that way, the students were conducting a very valid and valuable form of protest. That shouldn't be overlooked in this discussion, either.

Once an account is qualified you then move to the next phase of your sales cycle, such as pitching, value building, quoting etc and this is when it's helpful to have more people involved from their side. If you identified they don't make a purchase decision without the COOs involvement, but they want a demo, then you make sure you're not just demoing to a sysadmin for example, you should endeavour to get someone from the COO's office involved also to help you maintain momentum and get your account to move towards consensus.

I'm not being anti-intellectual. I'm asking you to either discuss God in his entirety, or discuss a god of your imagination (i.e., a god who is only all-loving, but nothing else). Only God in his entirety, as he is revealed in the Bible, is the God that I'll find worthwhile discussing here.

>Additionally, omnipotence should allow god to do anything.

I don't believe God is ""omnipotent"" in that sense of the word. That isn't born out in the Bible. He is almighty, but he is bound by his nature. Since his nature is perfect, it works out that he wants to be this way, but his love is bound his righteousness; his righteousness by his love; his strength by his inability to be harmed by himself; etc.

Can he do anything? I don't know. But according to his nature, he will not do some things. For example, he will not be God and not-God at the same time; he will not (cannot?) sin; he will not (cannot?) destroy some part of himself; etc.

>I'm here to talk about Zen. That's my motivation. If somebody doesn't know about Zen why would they pretend to teach it? 

Maybe they are just mis-informed. Maybe they thought they understood but don't. It could be possible that there are many who do just pretend to know but don't. Honestly though it's hard to tell where someone's heart is at. I think more ppl will respond positively from mutual respect, if someone does make a post that you feel is not in line with zen then you can respectfully and tactfully disagree with them. Other ppl will look at your post in light of how you present It. For example if you come off as condescending or rude then the truth of your post may be obscured by it's tone and you may unintentionally lend credence to the person you were arguing against.

This is a forum about Zen, and every day people come in here an post religious dogma that has nothing to do with Zen. Are you at all concerned at the ongoing hostility toward Zen Masters?

My serious answer is this: Zen lineage is not a sentient being, it can neither be hurt nor offended. As for Zen masters themselves they should be treated with respect but they probably aren't hurt or offended by words either on account of them being Zen masters. I do think that people who are misinformed about Zen should be corrected on a Zen forum but I don't think there is cause for disrespect as that not only turns them away from what you're saying but it causes others to disregard what you're saying as well.

There is nothing wrong with wanting the truth or fighting for its expression on a forum. I'm not saying to not insist on honesty however saying something untrue and lying are different things. I can be misinformed about something and earnestly believe in what I say but not speak the truth and on the other hand I can lie by professing something I don't believe to be true and happen to be speaking the truth unintentionally.

>The GOP committed to not working with Obama before he spent his first night in the Whitehouse, for no reason other than him being ""on the other team"". That type of behavior is completely unprecedented in recent history (past 50 years at least). This is all easily backed up by empirical stats regarding pretty much every measure of government function. They have set new records in seemingly every measure of obstructionism. It isn't at all uncommon for GOP congressmen to be hard line against something they were previously vocal about supporting.

Opposing a president doesn't mean they're to blame. Just because the president has a D in front of his name doesn't mean it's the Democrats' turn to run the show. If they're an obstructionist congress, then he's an obstructionist President.

That video is an extremely severe example of ""wrong thinking"". She uses all kinds of scientific-sounding terminology, but there's really not a cohesive scientific thought to be had in the whole video. Instead it's a slick marketing campaign that takes advantage of people who know just a tiny bit about science (""You know what H2O is? You know who Einstein is? String theory is about vibration..."") to convince them that her claims about homeopathy are scientific, when in fact the complete opposite is true.

> I am clearly promoting wrong thinking by being open on a message board about my speculation of the possible unseen causes of ""ghosts.""

Perhaps I'm being overly nit-picky, but if you had said, for example, that ""what people perceive as ghosts might be some sort of scientific phenomenon that we don't yet understand"" then I probably would have thought nothing of it and not even replied. That's just being open-minded about possibilities. But saying ""ghosts might be some type of energy crossing dimensions or space/time"" sounds scientific and overly specific. Even if there is such a thing as ""energy crossing dimensions"" there's no reason to expect it should occur in ""haunted houses"" rather than in the atmosphere, the oceans, and out in space where it would have been readily observed and measured by sensitive, calibrated scientific instruments.

> We are all energy

Again, I know this will probably sounding condescending. I'm sorry about that. But in science energy is a mathematical quantity describing the ability to do ""work"", which is generally a force times a distance. It is not ""stuff"" that anything can be made of. One could just as easily say ""we are all chi"" to sound eastern and transcendental, say ""we are all energy"" to sound scientific, or say ""we are all temperature"" to sound confusing, but none of them really mean anything at all.

You are right that we probably just have to agree to disagree. I'm sure you're a nice person in real life, just as Dr. Werner and Dr. Behe are probably very animated and fun people to hang out with, but that doesn't make their views scientific or correct.

"Thanks for your well thought out response. I have a few comments to add.

> [Trump's] comments were directed to the Obama appointees in the IC leadership, but the media made it sound like he was at war with the rank and file.

Trump on a couple occasions made condescending comments about the IC community, most notably via twitter. So, I don't think the media has been biased in this area. But, I'm curious what makes you think that it's only Obama appointees that are leaking? Most of the IC staff and government bureaucracy in general are long term employees, not Obama appointees. Have I missed something where a few appointees were caught leaking?

> The game the leakers and the media are playing now is to throw shit out there, let the left spin it as the most outrageous thing ever and sadly it will stick with too many folks.

I don't know man. Branch out to foreign media like the BBC or the Guardian, and you see similar stories. I could buy your argument if the spin was only US media, but it seems to be global media, which has made me question the assertion that it is media spin.

I looked into things a bit more. Russia interfered with the election, that seems to be well reported in the media, and Trump even asserted that was the case at his last press conference prior to becoming president. I don't see spin here, I did when Trump challenged it, but he changed his line on that. So, it's pretty clear there was Russian interference.

Regarding the 7 countries in the immigration ban. I did more reading as well. The issue is not solely the 7 countries listed, it is that it is a Muslim ban from those countries which is against the constitution. E.g. refugees are refused unless they are minority religions (ie. not muslim). That's in part why the courts took issue with it.

> Flynn's rights were violated in that leak and he was politically assassinated as a result. It was kind of a soft coup.

This is interesting, can you expand on that? For me the issue was that Flynn lied to the VP, isn't that reason enough to fire someone whose primary job is to give you advice, the guy could no longer be trusted by the whitehouse. That's why I didn't see it as a political assassination, but what angle am I missing?

"> the underlying problem is a racism that people refuse to recognise in themselves and others

Neatly sums up the incredibly condescending attitude that has IMO caused so much of the anger surrounding this campaign. 

The working classes, and not just the white working class, have been raising concerns about the effects of huge immigration on their employment prospects, housing, access to public services and culture for years and have consistently been told they're racist. 

IMO a lot of the reason for the support for Brexit is a backlash against exactly that attitude, even if Brexit will actually harm their own interests and make no difference to immigration it feels like a collective 'fuck you' to a political class which has consistently ignored them.

That notwithstanding it's IMO irresponsible journalism not to mention poor taste to leap to these conclusions when so little is known. "

There are lots of YouTube videos on body language (incl. how to be more ""open""). I also recommend people with resting bitch face (not sure if that's applicable here, just incl. in case helpful, but don't want to cause any offence!) try to keep a light smile on their face permanently, basically a slight up-curve to the lips and cheeks. It's actually really hard to maintain it, but even if you slip in and out of the smile, people will still see you smiling more often than if you didn't do this, and think of you as a happy and open and approachable individual. Another good trick is to lightly touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth. It's very hard to keep any muscle tension in your jaw when you do this, so it tends to soften most people's facial expression instantly. It's also a good relaxation trick if you're prone to jaw tension and tension headaches! Obvs ignore all this if not relevant, I really don't want to be condescending!

THX and Graffiti were relatively miniscule successes, he got producers interested in Star Wars mainly because of the beautiful concept art drawn by Ralph McQuarrie. Lucas stated this in an interview. He also spent quite a number of years outlining Star Wars. There are plenty of other 'first-hit wonder' examples like Rowling. Off the top of my head, I can think of Patrick Rothfuss, Stephenie Meyer and E.L. James. It just makes sense to me that if you believe yourself to be a writer that has what it takes to be big, you would work on perfecting one major work than trying to do inferior works just for the sake of it.

It should say everything... How many stories do you know that actually have the elements that I stated, in an original/fresh manner (relative to the general audience at the time)?

">Yes I said this. This argument is still in my favor because if the game breaks realism to this degree, why would you expect it to not have voice lines in english?

i'm saying that in current gameplay, we're already have certain things established. this has been established to be a world where vikings speak icelandic, knights speak latin, and samurai speak japanese, as well as a world where ninja's can smoke-cloud teleport. i'm also arguing against the ""this is meant to be realistic and historical"" argument.

>Campaign, everyone speaks english. Why? Because players need to be able to understand what's going on. The argument is between immersion and function. Is it immersive to have the heroes speak their own language, yes it is, but is it functional? No in the slightest.

what functionality is it supposed to have? there's no narrative that needs to be told in PVP. changing what the characters say serves no purpose besides changing what has already been set, and what players are already used to.

>Let's take your own example of Skyrim. Each race speaks a diffrent language, elves speak elvish, norse speak nordish, red guard speak whatever language theirs is called, and so on and so on. Yet when you play the game, everyone speaks the same language. Why? Because it's a functional aspect that players need in order to understand what is going on. Same rule applies here.

no, the same rules do not apply here. the only cultures in skyrim that have separate dominant languages are the ancient elves, dragons, and gods. everyone else speaks the same primary language, while still having their own ""traditional"" language, because they all are under the same empire.

a good example of this in real life is modern day ireland, where the vast minority of the population actually speaks gaelic as a first language, the rest knowing english as their first.

""for honor"" doesn't have this luxury, because these are all opposing cultures that have pre-established primary languages.

>No it doesn't, because the vocal minority does not represent everyone. People whoa re dissatisfied with a change are far more likely to voice their opinion about it, than people who do like the change. This is true for literally everything about people ever, not just games.

we have no reason to believe that it truly is just the minority, unless you can point me to something.

>Incorrect. They gain a bit of personality to their game, more recognizable heroes. After all we all know about INCREDIBLIS and AD MORTEN INIMICUS memes. Their goal is most likely reaching more lines of this level for more recognition.

you're missing the point. i mean fiscally. they will not gain more players for centurion saying ""incredible"" instead of ""incredibilis,"" while many players are clearly dissatisfied with the concept of that change. this offers them no true benefit, and is more likely to drive some players out than to pull new players in.

also, you don't need them to specifically SAY things to establish personality. we have emotes, executions, and general design for that, which everyone can see. even without the voicelines, we'd still know that centurion was an incredibly arrogant showman because he has emotes of him striking poses and being generally very condescending, and has executions of him making a game of his kill. we'd know that shugoki has a childlike sort of ruthlessness because all of his executions show him killing by slowly crushing the life out of his opponents, from sitting on them with all his weight to crushing their skulls with his hands, while his ""friendly"" emotes show him being generally playful."

"> The loud are not the majority.

I know that's a common situation, but you're discarding me with a ""popular saying"" when there's a lot of problems with what you're saying. For one, it shows apathy from actual feminists who do nothing to detach them from the others. In addition, how do I know that's the case? How do I actually know that the loud feminists (ie: the bad ones) are not the majority, when they're the only ones that seem to show up?

The fight for equality is about women becoming equals in rights with men, so everyone's on the same level. And I wholeheartedly agree with this. But that's just not what it looks like at this point. It's no longer about giving everyone equal freedom anymore. It's about giving everyone equal restrictions. I honestly don't know of any recent feminist strides in the OCDE countries (which is where, again, ""feminists"" are the loudest), except for the legalisation of abortion (which, again, I wholeheartedly agree with), which means one of three things: there are no more issues to be fought for; there are issues, and women are fighting for them; or, there are issues, and women aren't fighting for them. I'd be really pressed to believe in the latter, because all I hear ""feminists"" talking about is ""mansplaining"", and ""manspreading"", which I immediately dismiss as non-issues, which is exactly what they are. 

Actually, it's funny that I use a dictionary to claim that, since some already include mansplaining as an actual word. Another way of looking at it, though, is that these ""feminists"" are not only loud enough, but in enough number as well to transform non-issues like those into real, actual issues for which they fight for in a fierce, forceful, discriminatory, and sexist fashion. And their ways are so twisted that it's part of their agenda to keep people in the dark about men's issues. In other words: you can't simply dismiss all I say with ""the loud are not the majority"". Those ""feminists"" are making these very real changes, and you can't possibly dismiss that because you perceive them as a minority.

> I know many, many feminists that are not overly dramatic about it, so they don't talk about it.

That you can name offhand? If your definition of ""many"" is ""less than 10"", then so do I. On the other hand, I see thousands everywhere making the most outlandish claims. It's the same thing as above: they're louder, and they sure do look like the majority to me right now.

> If you dig around on the internet, of course you are only going to find the crazies

You use the word ""dig"" as if it required any effort to find one. As you can see from this very post, you can easily find them on Tinder, which is a pretty mainstream app. You can easily find them on Facebook, on blogs, websites, journals, YouTube, TV, movies, music, they're actually everywhere. And then you simply dismiss them as ""the loud that are not the majority"". And dismissing seems to be the way many people choose to be comfortable with this. Some (even more) simply dismiss this as a joke.

>Communism is an economic AND a political system. The reason Communists are atheists is because Karl Marx, one of the people responsible for Communism, rejected it outright (Quote: Religion is opium of the people).
I brought up the correlation because Communist countries are societies which reject religion completely. I was pointing out the flaw in your thinking that religion is responsible for the violence in the world. It isn't. If that were true, Communist nations would be some of the most peaceful societies in the world since they do not embrace religion. The truth of the matter is that people and life are more complex than you appear to recognize. There is good and bad in every socio-economic spectrum of the world.

Again, communism does not equal atheism no matter what Marx thought about god. Fuck...this is just a mind numbing discussion...

Perhaps the reason communist societies suck so bad is because communism is a terrible economic system not because they are atheists. The experience of atheist Northern Europe would support this idea.

Life is only more complex than I seem to realize when you make me a straw man and argue with ideas I haven't put forth. Religion is one of many problems which contribute to violence, I haven't said otherwise. 

>You're referring to orthodox or fundamentalist believers. The important thing to remember here is that religious believers are not a monolithic group. Religious beliefs exist on a sliding scale, not unlike the political spectrum. As such, it is not uncommon for political/religious moderates, such as myself, to butt heads with fundamentalists in both the political and religious arena. Those who espouse extremist religious views are often the most extreme elements of religious followers, the American Taliban if you will. These people are also most often the ones espousing an authoritarian form of governance (e.g., Ted Cruz, FAR right wing Conservatives, etc.). You will never find moderate elements of most religions and political groups espousing the abject nonsense we often hear coming from extremists for the simple reason that they recognize it violates the fundamental tenets of their religious and social values. The best elements of this nation's founding principles came from moderate religious elements of our society.

You really don't need to explain this. Yes there are people who can rationally pick and choose the parts of a religion they want to follow to reduce the harm the texts cause. What's your point?

Ah yes, the right not to be offended or have people disagree with your beliefs. This is the crux, I don't dislike Jewish people because of their beliefs...I don't think their beliefs are true. It's the belief I don't believe in..we have to be able to separate the two. When extraordinary claims about sky monsters are made with zero evidence those claims are open to criticism. It doesn't mean I am against the people. Funny enough I happen to share most of their values anyway..I just think people came up with them not the a celestial being. People have this extreme persecution complex when someone disagrees with their beliefs. Non-belief somehow get's conflated with persecution. They aren't the same thing. I respect their right to believe whatever they want, I respect their right to assemble and worship whatever they want. I have the same right and if I think a religion's beliefs are silly I should be free to think that without being judged as against the people who believe it. I don't have a duty of respect when I talk about how silly the whole thing is anymore than a Baptist preacher has a duty of respect to me when he's talking about how long an immoral pervert like me is going to burn in hell...so let's quit demanding so much sensitivity towards beliefs and feelings because neither side shows it.

"Koyomi has idolized Hanekawa for years now. Whether he's in love with her or not is highly debatable, but in Second Season, when Hanekawa confessed to him, she chose her words very carefully. She asked him if he loved Senjougahara more than him, and he replied that he did. That doesn't mean he doesn't love Hanekawa. 

Why does the Starry Night scene get to be enough? Not to sound rude, but why do you get to dictate whether that scene is enough, and what scenes are not? It's outrageous to assume that indomitable trust was established in one night they shared together. Even if the show does explicitly say that the Starry Night scene did establish trust, we as real human beings know that that's completely outrageous, and like I said, unrealistic and not human. 

> Koyomi blows things wildly out of proportion except for at certain moments.

Ooooh, please don't use this argument. The ultimate cherry picking tool, even in your statement. ""Except at certain moments"". Do you get to decide what these moments are? You Monogatari fans love this argument because it literally lets you cherry pick any negative aspect away from the show, and brushes it off with the unreliable narrator argument. It has no legitimacy to it. If you want to use the unreliable narrator argument, let me reverse the perspective. Koyomi is actually much more of a pedophile and is much more incestuous than he leads the viewer to be. All those times he wrestled with Hachikuji, he actually completely had sex with her. However, he wanted to seem less of a pedophile, thus made it seem as if they only wrestled. And when he brushed Karen's teeth, the toothbrush was actually his penis, and he actually had oral sex with Karen. Worried about his image, he made it a toothbrush.

There, if you want to use the unreliable narrator argument I get to as well. There's an equally as high chance that Koyomi is actually having sex with every other female, and is actually changing the story to make him seem better. Let's throw more on top of this, in reality he's not dating Senjougahara, she still acts as condescending to him as ever. That actually makes more sense given how much they don't act like a couple, as I stated earlier.

And here lies the issue of the unreliable narrator argument. Who gets to draw the line? You can't use it to cherry pick your way out of criticism. With this perspective motif, are we, as viewers, supposed to go into the show with the mindset that we're watching a completely fictitious work? It just doesn't make sense that we would be expected to be watching a blatantly misconstrued, fictitious universe. And I'm baffled that the fans of the series take it upon themselves to determine what's stretched through Koyomi's perception, and what is not. The unreliable narrator argument has never been explicitly stated by Shaft and is completely a figment of our own imagination that we've applied to the series."

I'm a very strong atheist, but not everyone in the world is. I hope to teach my daughter that other people believe in god, and that she's free to make up her own mind. In my ideal world, everyone would be an atheist, and so no one would proselytize to her; in the real world, she's going to be constantly exposed to religion and she's going to have to make up her own mind. I don't see any harm in her learning to deal with that early. While I wouldn't choose to have my daughter's friends try to convert her, they're free to do so, and the burden is on me to give her the tools to resist their attempts if she wants to.

You can guess what happens. Only the supervisors ever speak up. No one below them will ever bring up any sort of idea, fearing the ""wrath"" of their supervisors.

>This is possibly an English as a second language issue is well. 
 
As a person who has studied and speaks several languages (for reference and credibility, not bragging), when speaking a language that's unfamiliar, a person will usually do one of two things: 1) Try to speak the foreign language using a direct translation (and syntax) of their own language (not advisable). 2)Try to adapt to the syntax and sentence construction method of the foreign language. Number 1 is not advisable because it will almost always cause you to end up difficult to understand, because of difference in grammatical structure, etc. And I've heard Chinese businessmen try to speak in broken English, and while they're sometimes difficult to understand they do not sound condescending to me. ""English as a second language"" doesn't pass as an acceptable excuse in my opinion.

Very true. Language in general is heavily influenced by culture. Japanese are very indirect especially when asking for favors or requests.

Even when someone from a ""lower"" rank talks to someone of a significantly higher rank, the speech pattern is the same as talking with a kid. I've had entry level workers talking to a manager like this ""Hey, look at this purchasing request form. We need to buy so and so. Sign it.""

"I hope I didn't come off as implying you hated Black and White, I just wanted to say that I think story in Pokemon only started regressing recently.

At the same time, though, I disagree with some of the things you said, namely...

> Constantly sucks the player character's cock

While there are some instances of this, I feel it isn't pronounced as, say, the player in X and Y (AKA the worst Pokemon games of all time, but that's for another day). The game only starts sucking hard once you get the Dark/Light Stone, but at that point it's kind of warranted given you're Unova's last hope. Before then, Cheren, while not Blue-level, is still a bit condescending at times. Clay only starts rooting for you at N's Castle; before then, he actively blames you for letting Team Plasma into Driftveil and doesn't seem to have much confidence in you. Alder, while he tries to encourage you, seems to have the mindset that he doesn't need the legendary dragon, and by extension the player, to take on N (which, as it turns out, he was very, very wrong about), and that's just what I remember from my last playthrough, which was over a year ago. (God, I need to replay these games for what, the millionth time now?) 

> , gives little challenge, 

To be fair, all Pokemon games are like this, and I think Black and White are definitely the hardest in the series so far unless you count Challenge Mode in B2W2. The level curve can come to haunt you very quickly, and all the gym leaders can prove to be threats, even the Triplets if you don't use the elemental monkey. Lenora has that Retaliate Watchog, Burgh is admittedly pathetic, Elesa has Volt Switch on all her mons, making her harder to predict her next move, Clay has Bulldoze Excadrill, making it ever easier for the OU mon to take you out, Skyla is also actually pathetic as well as Bryce, but Drayden/Iris has a Dragon Dance Haxorus, which is just demonic. Marshall is probably the most difficult E4 member in the series thus far, and every other member of the E4 too manages to be at least somewhat challenging in their own way compared to past games. N is the only in-game trainer to ever use a legendary. Ghetsis speaks for himself. Alder, while mostly somewhat weak, has a Volcorona with Quiver Dance IIRC, and he isn't afraid to set up to sweep you with it.

Compare the sheer amount of difficult boss battles to previous games; RBY only really has Misty and Sabrina (in Yellow only, though), GSC only has (arguably) Whitney, Clair and Lance, RSE has no one last I recall, DPP has Cynthia, and XY too only has Grant. 

> Tries to talk about how each pokemon is valuable, yet has gameplay that makes most pokemon feel worthless.

I staunchly disagree with this. There are admittedly many com mons that cheapen their worth a bit, but I bet you have had at least one moment here you found a rare Pokemon in the wild after hours of hunting, or had the fortune to run into a random shiny. This is incredibly satisfying and gives the feeling of worth to those Pokemon. Even then, the IV and EV system helps to make each Pokemon feel unique in a sense, although the system is flawed at best. 

> About half-way through the game, every trainer has a full team. There's too damn many times where I have to ask 'how the fuck did someone get this far with only a wingul?'

That's easily handwaved in story; not every trainer starts from your hometown. Even if they have a Level 50 Sunkern or some shit, you could argue they had the luck to be given that by a friend or happened to run into it in the wild despite the fact you can't.

I agree that in-game trainers should have more diverse teams, however, especially the obligatory evil team.

I hope I haven't contradicted myself or come off as rude at all; if I've made any mistakes, please correct them. I definitely like the second idea, although I do think I would prefer it if the series went back to a similar style of its glory days of Gen V."

It's difficult to explain the reasons why it won't cost anything in the long term, and very little in the short term, to those indoctrinated into the capitalist mentality that ""money"" is a limited commodity in and of itself (rather than representing the distribution of resources). Universal health literally would not cost a thing. The aggregate price tag would decline, so even the healthy members of the upper class would see very little or possibly no increase. Those who currently aren't insured (which, BTW, is basically only a group at the bottom end of the lower-middle class) would continue to actually get health care not through the ER, and those who do have healthcare would continue to pay for like always, aside from a different method to collect the funds. The issue is only partially about who gets health care, less about who pays for it, and almost entirely about why a few get rich off of holding our health ransom to profit motive.

Generally speaking, the same applies to ""free tuition"", except addressing over-priced private colleges and extortionist loans rather than ER visits and health insurers.

I don't know what you're talking about. If you have anything in the Torah that says women are second class, I would love to see it. This ode is inherently a praise and if it was condescending, it would have no purpose. Why write an ode in a book of proverbs if it is condescending? If Judaism really looks down on women, and women are binary, why bother writing about them at all? They aren't equal and have no thoughts of being equal, therefore there's no purpose in humoring them.

2. God placed the snake there deliberately.

3. God was giving him the chance at coming clean. I don't know if you have kids, but if you don't, a common parenting tacticwhen a child misbehaves is to ask them what happened, even if you know what happened. It's the process of growth after a mistake. Admission of guilt.

> Real Flat Earth Theory relies upon Rational Empiricism: what can be know from direct observation or very safely inferred from it.

Well, yes. The initial idea does. The world looks flat, there the world is flat. That bit I understand. But then we you see the sun disappear over the horizon then rational empiricism goes out of the window with the cat. You go to great lengths then to destroy what people know about optics, the eye and how the brain interprets what you see to make the it all fit your first observation. The sun cannot go beneath the Earth because if it did you wouldn't get timezones. Unless of course those time zones are spread around the earth in a cylindrical way.

Inferring anything after 'looks flat' goes against empiricism, and quite frankly takes a major blocking of nearly 3000 years of physical observations, common sense and a massive amount of evidence to the contrary. It requires you to rely on people on YouTube who have an ulterior motive to either convert, scam or sell to you.

> A dome might exist, but there have been enough high altitude flights (not nasa's fake space movies) to know that it probably does not exist.

Again, you are throwing away rational empiricism to speculate on whether or there is a dome. You are now delving into the realm of 'making shit up' because it fits your view of the world or it fits your holy book, which version of the inferred insanity you wish to take is not really important at this point.

> The 24hr southern summer could easily be caused by the presence of a second sun that simultaneously illuminates the portion of the ring not being lit by the primary sun.

The only empirical observation supporting flat Earth conjecture is 'It looks flat, it must be flat'. 

> Unfortunately, your patronizing tone suggests to me that you will not keep an open mind about a system of thought that is quickly moving to replace centuries of scientific religious dogma.

So, the view that goes against the holy books, is constantly being changed and updated as observations are made deeper and deeper into our reality is the religious dogma? Fucking hell, man, look at yourself. You're a disgrace. Open your mind, forget that you think the world should be flat and look at the evidence beyond 'it looks flat'. Why do you think that the flat Earth requires such tedious and lengthy explanations for things that science says is easily explained?

Mountains aren't high enough for the curve to be obvious, pretending that they are shows that you either don't know just how big the Earth is compared to you, or that you cannot comprehend the simple idea that when you take a narrow enough view of a round object it will appear flat.

Do you know what Airy was looking for when he ran his experiment? At the time it was believed that, just like sound, light needed a medium to pass through, it was long suspected at the time that the Earth moved and all Airy's failure showed was that there wasn't any abberation caused by the Earth moving through the aether. If the sun, moon or stars was moving through the aether you would also see the abberation, but in a different way to if the Earth was moving through it. Airy failed to detect any abberation at all. The only conclusion you can make is that there's no aether. TBH the aether only existed as an excuse as to how you could see light through a vacuum. Once you establish that it's not a pressure wave like sound, you no longer need it.

They don't. Saying so means that you are either unaware or just lying. The size of the sun changes size in the sky as our elliptical orbit around it moves inward and outward.

This is why a full solar eclipse doesn't happen every every orbit.

> Try those, just for starters, and as yourself why science is so infallible. You might learn a thing or two...

It's not infallible, and it doesn't take much digging to find that out. Einstein falsified Newton, Brahe falsified the crystal spheres, Galileo falsified geocentrism. Keppler and Bessell falsified Brahe's idea that the stars that were dimmer in the sky were further away and therefore larger than other stars. Science is fallible, it's what it relies on. Constant evolution from idea to idea.

Flat Earth is not a theory, as a theory can be used to make predictions. You are unable to make predictions about anything. You can't even explain how mountains can cast a shadow on the underside of clouds. The extent of empirical evidence for the flat Earth is 'it looks flat' and that's where you stop. However there's plenty of empirical evidence against it. I also get extremely frustrated that you throw out a massive amount of evidence simply because you believe it to be fake. You have no evidence against the NASA footage, nothing to say it is fake or CGI.

"> Do you think it’s good advice though?

No, I think it's terrible advice. It limits, condescends and infantilises women. It's offensive, insensitive and misses the point. Most rape isn't stranger rape, so it probably isn't going to reduce the risk of rape for most women anyway. It's frightening, dangerous and uninformed advice which shouldn't be coming from police officers but it IS because society's attitude to rape is STILL to lecture women, and not to lecture potential rapists. 

That used to be the way with drink driving too. They used to say, 'don't walk around or drive around christmas, there'll be drunks on the road'. And you could apply your same logic here - well, isn't it my responsibility to keep myself out of danger and not go on the road if I know there'll be drunk people? Isn't it women's responsibility to keep themselves off the roads if they know there'll be rapist? It's a stupid line of logic because it preaches to the wrong group, the potential victims, without addressing the perpetrators. People used to say, there's no point in targeting drunk drivers because they're going to drive anyway, and that's the same line of argument used now with rape. 

> The onus is always on me to maintain the integrity of my identity and online accounts

Please stop comparing rape with passwords for your online bank accounts, it's an insensitive analogy. My vagina is not a password, I'm not being reckless by going outside with it, and I can't lock it away even if I wanted to. Changing your online passwords is NOT THE SAME as being told not to leave your house alone because if you do, you'll get raped. 

> agree that saying “it’s your fault” is victim blaming. I don’t understand how saying ‘Don't walk home alone, you might get raped', is equivalent of saying “it’s your fault”, any more than saying “don’t use an insecure password” is equivalent of saying “it’s your fault”.

Because this advice LEADS to victim blaming.

I think it's stupid, terrible, offensive advice which shames women who have been raped, I think it leads to and causes victim blaming. It in itself is not necessarily victim blaming, and doesn't necessarily come from a malicious place or with malicious intent. It's still bad.

A guy I've been with (not really seeing each other now because of distance) is an atheist and his sense of humor can tend to be on the antitheist side, so it can be kinda painful for me just looking at his tumblr because some of the things he reblogs are just so...blasphemous. He's a pretty cool guy and I find him really attractive, but that sort of thing would make me doubt anything lasting extremely long. To an atheist, religion might not seem like much because its nothing to them, but to a religious theist its basically everything. It just becomes difficult trying to work that out.

Total Depravity is another poorly understood concept by non-Calvinist although it is not their fault. I've read Calvin's institutes and I don't recall every seeing that term. It came a hundred years later in response to Arminianism. There were 5 points of Arminianism so the Calvinists countered with the 5 points of Calvinism and the acronym TULIP. Anytime you try to distill several thousand pages of systematic theology into a 5 letter acronym there is a high likelihood of something being a little ham fisted. Total depravity does not mean utter depravity. It does not mean we are as bad as we can be. It means every part of us is corrupted to some extent. We take love and turn it into jealousy if even just a little bit. We take lust and turn it into infidelity and disease if just a little bit. We take good works and turn it into pride. Sin is an archery term, it means to miss the mark. We miss the mark by some non-zero amount on everything. That is not the same as saying we are as bad as we could possibly be. I'm a good husband and father. Those two things are what I cherish most. Even at that I don't do them perfectly. So Total depravity extends to my ability to be a husband and a father, even though I think I measure up pretty well in those categories. That is what it means to be totally depraved. Again, thousands of pages of systematic theology boiled down to a 5 letter acronym. Give them a bit of grace if they forced it a little. They were Dutch after all and as Homer Simpson says ""when in doubt go with what you know"" therefore TULIP. 

>Why do we deserve ""justice"" for a sin condition we are born into through no fault or choice of our own?

Thats a good question and one I struggle with. There are two questions I honestly struggle with. Why is there suffering and how can we be judged for something we have no control over? In both instances God does not answer but gives us enough to have faith.

Why is there suffering? I don't know, but whatever the reason it was important enough for God to condescend, put on flesh and suffer along side us.

How can we be judged based on how we were born? I don't know but God offers free grace. It is a grace that is in no way conditioned on what we've done either. You were born guilty and born saved. You don't get that with Arminianism. In fact, Arminianism says the opposite, that you were born guilty and it is up to you to be saved. Why is that preferable? How is God more desirable in this circumstance? This makes no sense to me!

Perhaps someone has a more satisfying answer. Every belief system has challenges. You don't get away from it by being Atheist, or agnostic, or Buddhist or Muslim or frankly even an universalist. There is no safe haven. Reformed Christianity is at least consistent. "
"> This isn't /r/politics. Keep your tone civil.

My tone was civil. Condescending a little (no...a lot) but not rude by personally assaulting you at all.

> Yeah, the budget wasn't ""the bare minimum"" required to keep the State Department functioning. I suspect you understand that upgrading embassy security would require more than the ""bare minimum"" it takes to keep the government running.

Of course...But you keep forgetting a couple of aspects:

 The attack wasn't on the embassy but a consulate.

 Additional security for the ambassador was denied, not because of budget cuts but because of political reasons.

> From the State Department's Accountability Review Board:
""For many years the State Department has been engaged in a struggle to obtain the resources necessary to carry out its work, with varying degrees of success. This has brought about a deep sense of the importance of husbanding resources to meet the highest priorities, laudable in the extreme in any government department. But it has also had the effect of conditioning a few State Department managers to favor restricting the use of resources as a general orientation.""

Again...This is nothing new. You're welcome to provide an example of a department or agency that has received full funding to do everything that it wants. The reality is, it's called a budget for a reason.

> Less money = less gets done.

Yes...Because money solves all the problems.

> I'm talking about specific funding requests for specific purposes. Your generalization says nothing about the merits of those specific requests.

To which your view is still wrong. What exactly do you think composes of embassy security? It's not just additional personnel (to which I might add that the host country is supposed to provide security personnel as well).

It includes taken measures to reduce the risk (to fully prevent will never happen) of an attack on an infrastructure, such as barricades, reinforced perimeter, reinforced walls, windows, security cameras, etc.

None of which was a factor in why Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans were killed.

It's not to say that even if Deputy Assistant Secretary Charlene Lamb granted the request for additional security would have prevented the deaths of the ambassador or other Americans but the outright denial because of political reasons is a deeper tragedy.

> I did a Ctrl + F for ""Clinton"" in both your linked sources and found nothing that says Clinton made the claim you attributed to her.

Oh...Those links I provided was in regards to Deputy Assistant Secretary Charlene Lamb since she was the one directly responsible for diplomatic and embassy security...but here you go:

 http 

 http 

> After that Republican members of Congress honed in on Lamb, who was also a witness, accusing her of failing to recognise the seriousness of the threat. Lamb responded that the requests were for more personnel in Tripoli

Ah...See...Maybe you are a little confused here but Tripoli is where the embassy is, which makes sense that the request for more personnel would originate from there.

Not to mention that some of those additional personnel would have traveled with the ambassador to the consulate in Benghazi.

> and it would have made no difference to how many security men would have been protecting the Benghazi consulate where protection was in any case mostly in the hands of a pro-government militia.

We're not talking about protecting the consulate but providing ample security for an ambassador and she doesn't know that. Not to mention the reality that there was a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) that could have responded quickly (hence the name) but was delayed in doing so.

> ""We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi on the night of 9/11,"" Lamb testified.""

Tell that to the ambassador and three other Americans that died that night.

> Lamb claims that she thought the security at Benghazi was adequate; therefore, of course she didn't have a budgetary reason for not stationing more men there.

So...Those who are actually there requesting additional security are denied because some woman in Washington DC thought it was adequate and she had a very good understanding and assessment of the situation?

> The reason, in her eyes, is that there were already enough assets defending Benghazi. There's no budget so low that it can't afford 0 more guards.

So...Basically you're contradicting your original statement with this statement about there wasn't enough security because of budget cuts but are now clearly saying there were already enough assets defending Benghazi?

> If you want to respond, keep it civil. I have no interest in reading an insulting rant.

I agree. And this is because of inherent sexism, and it's detrimental against men and women differently. But how to fix it is the issue. Feminism (at least when I look at 50's feminism, academic feminism) wants this fixed. And that's great, but can you imagine how far feminism would have gotten if it was largely a movement created and done by men telling women what they should be? No-where. It would be viewed as condescending and oppressive. MRA wants to be the male voice here, saying 'let's stop this bullshit'. MRA wants to be the ones to speak for men in the same way feminism spoke for women, in the way feminism can't speak for men without being condescending and demeaning. 

My concern is that the education being tilted further and further in one direction means that by the time I have kids, men will be in the same position women were 50 years ago - only fit for certain jobs because of an education gap. What I want is equality, and when it looks like the scales tip further than they should, maybe we should ease off pressing on one side just a bit."

>One possibility is that the mens behavior was horrific, and for some strange reason all those other women in the room didn't feel a need to shout and stomp off in a huff (including the female on the panel, one presumes). It looks like you're going with that.

The inaction of other women is not sufficient evidence to me that there was nothing uncouth going on. Before women had the right to vote, women were not stomping off ""in a huff"" at every election. Some women probably even seemed downright happy and even showed up to support with cookies and lemonade. This does not mean that everything was fine and dandy. 

The men suggested they were being browbeaten simply by being asked to refer to women as ""women"" and instead offered a condescending alternative of ""the weaker sex"" simply because a woman, in response to the question of why women avoid these things, had the absolute fucking gall to feel objectified by the unapologetic sexual harassment going on and if you truly cannot see anything wrong with that and truly the only problem you see here is that she CRIED, then calling yourself a feminist here is as meaningless as Sarah Palin calling herself a feminist.

">I'm just really terrified that someone who is un-medicated and really unstable/suicidal really can't take those kind of harsh critical words.

Is telling them how you honestly feel ""harsh"" and ""critical""? This isn't usual behaviour in a relationship. You should honestly consider if it's fair that your amount of honesty is limited to how much truth your SO can tolerate about how their behaviour affects others.

>I am worried I'll be accused of being ""manipulative"" if I say ""hey this makes me feel really anxious if you don't get meds or go to therapy"" because that has been a response I've gotten before.

I wonder why you worry about being called manipulative for expressing that someone's self-destructive behaviour affects you too, whereas you've said before that you can't even express when you've had a bad day because it'll make your SO feel even worse about themselves. This seems like a huge power imbalance in the relationship. I'm not suggesting this is something you bring up with them, but just something to think about on your end.

>But maybe it's all in the way I say it, and usually it's over texting which can be rife with misunderstandings.

I doubt it's so much what you say as the means through which it's being conveyed. Texting is the worst for having these kind of conversation because so much emotional context gets left out and everything comes across as flat and neutral. I'd recommend having a conversation over the phone/Skype/face to face for this reason, so that you can explain yourself in more detail, and even if you are saying things which your SO perceives as critical, your tone and demeanour will at least indicate that you're caring and supportive.

>What's interesting about the patient/carer dynamic is that they have criticized me for acting like their parent/therapist.

You literally cannot win in this scenario. They continually pull the rug out from under themselves, expect someone else to clean up the mess, then criticise you for doing so. No wonder you're exhausted and anxious all the time. You're being pushed into someone else's crisis state, then being made to feel awful for doing that when in fact, it was the right thing to do at that time.

>Though they do say that they love it when I ""take care of them"" and ""spoil them"" when they feel depressed, but they hate it when I do the same thing when they're manic or I guess fairly middle-ground as well.

It seems like your SO appreciates you creating a holding environment when they're depressed but resents you for doing it at other times. To that, I'd say that this is indicative of your SO not effectively setting boundaries and 'rules' for what they feel comfortable with. Not to mention that welcoming help when depressed but rejecting it when the opposite happens sends a conflicted message, despite being just as vulnerable in both situations. I'd recommend speaking to your SO to figure out between you what is the best thing you both can do in both states, in a way that works for both of your mental health.

>I actually talked to them last night about how stressed I feel about being tired and sad all the time, and feeling guilty for even going to therapy or considering looking for medication. I told them I wondered if I had Borderline-PD or ADHD / anxiety or depression and that I feel shitty a lot but it's not because of them. And they re-assured me that they want me to come to them about this stuff as much as possible.

This is a really positive step, so well done! You should be proud of yourself for biting the bullet and allowing yourself to be vulnerable with your SO. As expected, your partner does want to support you when you're feeling low, which is a great basis for further interaction in getting stuff off your chest. But I'd lie if I didn't also have some reservations about this. Your partner is telling the truth here about wanting to support you but has also engineered a situation where they can only do so on their terms or when it's favourable for them (unconsciously, I think). Are you really able to open up to them unconditionally (as any successful couple should) if it's conditional on your SO not being in a 'worse' state? Just something to think about.

>But I guess I still am terrified of it suddenly snapping back to the time where they told me things like ""I wish you didn't even like me so I could kill myself and not feel guilty about it"" almost every day.

I'm not gonna lie, there is the possibility of this happening if your SO continues to refuse to get treatment. Because people with bipolar are thinking this everyday, it becomes normalised for them and to some extent, their SOs. I say this as someone with bipolar though - this attitude is absolutely not healthy, not for your SO, not for you. They're essentially seeking permission to kill themselves, but it also creates a situation where, if you were to stop liking them, you would feel responsible for them committing suicide. That's not okay to put on anyone else, let alone your life and spiritual partner. I know this is a past attitude, but you seem to have a real fear of this resurfacing.

>Anyway. I might have painted a picture of them like some kind of monster, but they are literally the sunshine of my life and I don't know what I'd do without them. They are a truly amazing person and so dear to me.

Oh, absolutely. Bipolar SOs can be the most challenging, infuriating, and upsetting people you will ever meet, but we balance that out by being some of the most special and loveable people on Earth. I know it's not all bad in your relationship - after all, you're not here because of positive reasons and we're only here to listen/advise about what to do for the bad parts. I have no doubt your SO is a pretty amazing person and there is a lot of mutual love, but all the problems I've mentioned are inhibiting you from being a completely happy and healthy relationship.

It might sound condescending but you should take a minute to breathe and pat yourself on the back for being emotionally honest with your SO. It's not easy to do even when both people in the relationship are mentally healthy; the fact that you both experience mental health problems complicates this tenfold. It's positive that your SO has changed drastically once before to support you, so I believe they can do it again. It just takes a lot of willpower on their part to look at the ugliest parts of themselves, but that's not easy when you're severely depressed. In the meantime, be light and positive toward yourself - focus on the things you are successful at in the day rather than what you couldn't do. I honestly believe you two can work this out, but you have to be kind to yourself first."

It wasn't until the mods started banning bigots for ableist and virgin shaming slurs that SRSPrime users stopped using them. Unfortunately this demonstrates at least two things: 1. SRSPrime users are pretty much just sycophants parroting the words of their leaders (which is infinitely dangerous in many ways). 2. SRSPrime users don't think about or challenge their own preconceived notions or their leaders words, at least not on their own. I mean, as great as it is that they no longer call people ""retarded"" because they know doing so will get them banned, I think the fact that if they had been able to come to that conclusion on their own would be infinitely better. SRS uses the whip as a way to thought police even their own members.

I understand the conflict you're feeling, now hopefully that provides some perspective into what minorities in this country (USA) face everyday. A man simply kneels to put a spotlight into inequality and people foam at the mouth for his actions. It's not only the fans we hear it from but to hear it from the President of the country we reside in refer to these players as ""sons of bitches"" is despicable. As condescending as this sounds, it's good a random post on the internet ruffled your feathers to speak up. I hope you and other (white) citizens feel that same anger when you see the leader of the free world speak with such vitriol. Please find it within yourself to speak up to anyone, send a tweet, call a congressman. If you and enough people get involved then maybe we can change the current situation. And when you feel hopeless at the thought of your one voice not being enough to make a difference then you'll begin to understand how the ""black community"" feels."

You said it right in the line you yourself quoted in the above comment:

Do what you want, but I'd be pretty careful about appearing condescending with regard to games or any other aspect of technology. While it's not an immediate dealbreaker for me like making a racist joke or something, if a guy states or implies that I must only enjoy/be capable of playing simple games because I'm female, or is condescending about something relating to technology, that's definitely a black mark against him for me. 

Certainly there are some women who only play Farmville and Pokemon. If someone indicates in their profile or a message that they like games but their interest stops with stuff like that, then by all means, it makes sense to just talk to them about Pokemon. But I wouldn't make that assumption just because they're female.

>I think you're lowballing Shiki's speed here- she can not only cross 6m and eliminate two of Araya's bounded fields (he specializes in these as a mage, and they have been shown to also act as a form of autonomous defense), simultaneously she does this with speed that completely nulls Araya's ability to attack with a thought and a fist clench (more efficient than any bending), and takes away the advantage of escape afforded by his skill in spatial manipulation to escape (as shown in the second quote). Korra has not shown simultaneous combat and movement feats on this level.

You're lowballing Korra's reaction time and movement speed. 6m is barely over 1/3 of the distance she needs to cover, to say Korra couldn't react in that time (in the Avatar state, might I add) isn't giving her enough credit. She doesn't need to fight at that speed, all she needs to do is create some distance (her mobility is far greater than Shiki's). Araya was only taken so easily because he had a false sense of security behind his bounded fields (he wouldn't have cast them in the first place if he expected Shiki to just waltz through them). Your scenario would only play out in this situation if she wasn't expecting to be blitzed, and considering Shiki's only weapon, it would be common sense to think she'd try to cross the gap and attack up close.

>Wrong, it completely changes the outcome. The way you're putting it is simply that Shiki presses harder in fights, whereas the real difference is like receiving a high enough boost in overall combat capabilities to put her on such a level that if you compared knife-shiki to katana-shiki, knife-shiki would be like a low grunt compared to a highly skilled swordsman. It's like saying Nanaya mode for Tohno Shiki is simply ""Shiki with murderous intent"".

I acknowledge that there's a huge gap between the two Ryougi's abilities, but in this context it can't change the outcome. Her enhanced capabilities can't protect her from, say, an inferno or barrage of stone.

"> Women invented machiavellianism, men adopted it and refined it as their own natural advantage (physical strength) became outlawed and resulted in social ostracisation.

This is basically what most TRP folks are going through; we all are here congregating from our respective lives and communities where it was inadequately and leading us into self-sabotage and inter-gender relationship roadblocks, where our respective environments did not warrant/support or provide disarming and empowering advice and answers.

For sure, absolute and undistorted logic is not finding their way with modern females today as it does with males. We, unfortunately, must thrive and adhere to sound grounding with our identity, roles, and reality as a whole. On the flip side, for women, these things are very oppressing to self-actualize – that the male ultimately has a predisposed biological lead and power assigned to him. 

It means that females can't continue to self-delude themselves realizing that their immature behaviors will ultimately sabotage their youth, which should be productively utilized for the eventual hitting of the wall.

A women who manipulates and play games is ultimately undermining and destructing the man to ultimately become adequate providers and forayers on this earth. For without the man and his societal constructions, women would be just as destitute alongside with the homeless and her male relatives if they have personally failed.

I care not how much you can half-ass finagle some contribution on this planet, but with ingrained beta ideology and behaviors stemming from being socially conditioned from a single-mom ""family"" and feminism, you will risk losing not only all the accumulation of your earnings and works but your dignity and reputation; I care about more about your in-tactfulness and groundedness in your own reality – especially handling personal affairs. 

Contributions to society are circumstantial to a lot of external factors; whatever way you look at it, opportunity will always be unfairly disproportionately and irrationally distributed, especially comparing yourself to the 1%. The fellow man will acknowledge and respect a man in whatever socialeconomic position as long as he has maximized all his potential and opportunity available to him. There is no pity for those whom escape away in virtual realities, false bravado, and psuedo-machomism; you will reap the seeds you sow and the dividends, if not, the accruing interest beyond your youth.

A female's role is complementary to that of the males, and her rationalization of ""i'm a big independent girl now and i can do whatever i want"" is based on man's work (indentured servitude or genuine hard labor) preceded before them. Despite the technological advances humankind has made collectively to live modestly comfortably without the fear of much primitive threat today, doesn't invalidate the logic man utilizes to collectively further the human species/mankind. 

A true fellow man will never condescendingly look down on you for failures as great endeavors conquering your realm also comes with inopportune times; however, we should realize that the fellow man cannot look you to being equal if you get swindled by a romantic partner whom you designate the caregiver of your offspring. For this to happen, despite his biological advancement, a man is not a ""man"" per se, but likely to be emotionally arrested to fall victim into such female emotional entrapment. A true man is too busy and risks too much to be associated with a boy, unless that of his protege or son. 

I will self-incriminate myself here as well, most of the ""men"", including I, are essentially psychosocially still a child, a boy, if most, still developmentally an adolescent. Collective narcissism in mass media, consumerism, sports, video games, feminism only stunts and suppresses psychosocial growth for boys today. A ""man"" today has a lot to overcome in his internal mind, subjective reality, and external social establishments and misleading philosophical doctrines that undermines progressive psychosocial development into becoming the ideal man needed today. 

What we comprehensively need to become such person is still ambiguous and unclear given the turn-of-the century environment today, but we should acknowledge that our old ways of thinking and models ain't working. We'll work with what we've got for now and let's just realize that our community is at the avante-garde of converging a new field of intellectual discussion – utilizing game theory, sociology, biology, psychology, philosophy, etc. that is too politically incorrect for the mainstream to accept right now.

On a final note: Do not fall victim of the women whom commits such acts of thieving intergenerational offspring by sabotaging human biology through one-sided sexual politics. As much as we blame, or displace the blame, with women, let's be realistic, the onus still falls on us to self-actualize beyond this disillusionment of human/family structure dysfunctionalism. Accept the current reality but cultivate and build your own subjective reality with TRP framework to ultimately better the next generation/mankind. "

Ok, sure, when you aren't worried about subsistence (reasonable assumption for someone playing a collectable card game), you don't have any real problems in your life. So... it follows then that a sexist atmosphere is something that shouldn't be the subject of complaint? I don't think so.

This is exactly the victim-blaming attitude that is the problem, both with regard to sexism and to theft. On its own, it might seem that this is a reasonable attitude to have with regard to the issues at hand. But, implicit in this statement is the horrible suggestion that the current state of affairs are an immutable part of society today. While it might be said that crime is a necessity of living in reality -- should it be the case that engrained sexism should be a permanent part of reality?

Answering No leads me to say that what you are saying is ignorant, pandering bullshit. That isn't to say that you are ignorant or pandering, however. 

>The people trying to say MTG scares away women need to realize that it's men that scare away women. The average man is completely different around their friends in private (in comparison to their public life). I'm sure we can agree upon that. Now take men playing sports, card games, hunting, fighting wars, etc... In our element, we will mock other men very harshly, and generally no one is overly offended. This is something literally in our DNA for thousands of years. Men are aggressive, competitive, and generally looking for dominance at all times. Just because we got WIFI in the past 15 years, doesn't mean our DNA has changed.

First of all, when people say that MTG scares away women, they mean precisely that the men that play MTG scare away women. Second, despite the completely factually incorrect le biotruth master race nonsense about male aggression literally in our DNA, the above clarification is a distinction without difference -- and clearly states the assumptions that led to your earlier statements, in all of their problematic glory. Third, the factually incorrect nonsense about male aggression is about as sexist against men as is the inherent defense of the male-dominated atmosphere of MTG generally. Fourth, magic is not the same as war, is not the same as sports, is not the same as hunting, nor are any of those things equivocal or inherently male. Moreover, let me just state how fucking insanely stupid it is to say (or imply?) that, ""Men are in their element when at war"". Fifth, on the matter of offense: 
 Why should you assume that men aren't offended when you take a fucking card game so seriously that you need to insult someone while playing it? 
 Why would a man believe that haughty, domineering, arrogant, patronizing, condescending (etc) attitudes are a part of the larger attitudes of the community less than a woman would?

To the first question, that's how neckbeard became a popular word. 

To the second, I almost stopped playing magic entirely for a long time because of how fucking antisocial and stupidly serious people get when playing. If I were a woman, and I faced the same attitudes in my work, education, and everyday life, I would probably believe that they were related.

">We can address male suicide rates and catcalling at the same time, it's okay

The fact that catcalling is the thing you came up with to compare feminist issues with men's issues (ridiculous suicide rates) really demonstrates just how serious the problems feminists of the west insist on dealing with, not at all. The middle east is a different story but we all know how irrelevant that is to feminists in the US or EU.

Also, feminists are subscribers of postmodernism and so discussing things with men is never going to happen, because they believe that talking to a man about such issues means men have already won the power game. It also means that any facts or logic that proves a feminist wrong is the result of men interpreting the world in such a way as to favour men and so they can just ignore reality and substitute it with their own. This is what they do with things like rape culture, they claim men get away with rape, they can be praised for it, they are taught it's OK, meanwhile in reality raping a women is only second to raping a child as the worst thing to be accused of, even an accusation will lose people their jobs and even families, rapists are seen as the lowest form of scum.

"I'd like you to clarify a few things: 

> still as you say, V7->i is not a functional resolution of aeolian, however bVII7->i is (V7->vi), and is commonly called the ""deceptive cadence"". 

From what is said in this thread, I thought V7-i is a functional resolution, since it uses dominant-tonic relationship, and bVII7-i is the non-functional (i.e modal) one? Yet you seem to have it backward or am I missing something?

> the primary evocation of a triadic cadence in ionian is well known as IV-V-I, the major sub, major dom (evoking 4-7) and resolving to the major tonic such that the leading tone is contained in the chord directly prior to the tonic resolution (in this case 7 in V).
> 

From what I gather in this thread, it looks like we should distinguish between the major cadence and the Ionian cadence, in the sense that major cadence must be functional, and Ionian cadence must be non-functional, albeit them using the exact same tonic and set of notes. Same for minor vs. Aeolian. 

In that sense, iim7b5-V7-i is not a native minor cadence, but it's a functional minor cadence (who said it must be diatonic?). 

Then what you said, v-iv-i could be a Aeolian cadence (non-functional). 

However, the anology of ""b6 to fall to 5"" is not a sound explanation. The 5th is widely regarded as not necessary in major/minor chords. Often it's omitted to make room for extensions (7th, 9th,..). What if my tonic chord is 1, b3, b7, 9 (Am9 for example)? 

I think your point is that iii and IV could be established as ""fake tonic"" in major and minor? No objection there. But your use of mode name (instead of chord name/chord degree) is quite confusing: 
> 
> So, at least phrygian and lydian are both capable of supporting a (partial) functional tonic.
> this is however not true of mixolydian and dorian as they exert pure dominant and subdominant function respectively. 

Dorian and Mixolydian could very well be the tonic if we write the songs in their respective mode, instead of using the chords as ""deceptive cadence"" in major and minor. In a C major song, a sudden resolution to Em or any deceptive cadence wouldn't make the whole song Phrygian. 

> i find it impossible to simply say: but there is no function there! this is modal! the function falls out of the scale (just a bunch of notes) naturally. it isn't created or dismissed at will, it forms subconsciously in the mind of the listener. i would even go so far to say as fighting against that subdominant function in your home chord is one of the defining characteristics of pure dorian. 

I was wondering with the exact same thought, until this thread. Here ""functional"" shouldn't be taken in its literal meaning. If instead we rename it to ""potato harmony"", then dominant-tonic resolution is ""potato harmony"", and any other things, which could very well be functional in its literal meaning, are ""non-potato harmony"". The normal use of ""functional"" implies ""functional in a classical background"".

I think this is what Marvel wants. They don't seem to want Thanos to be terrifying, they want him to be kinda funny. I mean he has a purple face and a rainbow glove.

None of the Marvel villains have been very serious. Malekith maybe, but he also the most bland. Jeff Bridges, Tom Hiddleston, James Spader and Josh Brolin all have charisma. Marvel seems to be following a formula, and it's working great for them. 

I don't think I'll be intimidated by Thanos, but I'll probably be entertained. Brolin can do comedy, and the version of Thanos that we'll see in the films seems like a guy who makes a lot of condescending remarks and will probably have some funny one-liners before we watch him get beat up.

I agree, Thanos isn't like Darth Vader, where he's badass but also someone the audience takes seriously, but I'm not hyping myself up for one of the greatest on-screen villains ever anyways."

"> 9, 7, 0, holds more info than 1, 2, 3

Not only does it contain more information, more of that information is used.

Under IRV, the only thing that the method cares about is who is your favorite of the candidates that are still in the running. If literally everybody votes for a centrist as their #2 candidate, IRV completely ignores that fact; because they aren't the favorite of anyone, they would then be eliminated before any votes could be transferred to them (similar to what happened in Burlington)

> How much concern to give such a scenario is still debatable for me, balanced against other factors.

That is a legitimate question, and why I specifically pointed out Burlington; it was only their 2nd or 3rd election running with IRV, so it went sideways pretty quickly.

Also a legitimate question. It... kind of is. I say ""Kind of"" because in Australia, approximately 90% of races result in no difference from FPTP, just as FPTP gets the right answer a lot of the time.

So, on one hand, it is a cherry picked scenario, but then, pointing out the spoiler effect in the 2000 Presidential Election is cherry picking, too.

"So far Cap has only shown interest in two women, so it's more likely he is Carter-sexual, than straight, lol.

It looks like you are really ignorant, when it comes to sexuality. Sorry, this is what you sound like. People can be 90% straight, so mostly they take interest in the opposite sex and very seldom in their own.

No, there is not. Some people think Steve/Bucky scenes speak for themselves and they have total right to interpret it that way, since even Russos said they have and they are open to interpretation.

>Who is talking about this sub? 

I'm talking about this sub because I don't see why should I discuss only tumblr when it comes to shipping. I've seen many people obsessively shipping Buckynat here, so they are no better, but you only take an issue with Stucky fans, even though they are not special at all, other shippers are basically the same.

>Btw was a scene about Valkyrie (that showed her interest in women) that they removed it for whatever reason.

They REMOVED it. It's not canon.

>And I dont go to tumblr anymore, doesn't change the fact that shippers are obnoxious as hell. It seems like you are a passionate shipper, no need to get so worked up

I ship Steve with happiness, and yes, I love a good romance, but not with anyone in particular. Would be fine with anything that makes sense. And yes, whether you want it or not, Steve and Bucky make sense. 

I don't use tumblr much, I don't write or read fanfiction, but I know people who do it, and they are good people, they don't deserve to be generalized just because someone is unable to use blacklist function or restrain himself from some places on tumbler. I only defend people's right to ship who they want. No one is telling you to ship something. And I don't like when people use double standards regarding straight and LGBT ships. It reeks with hidden homophobia. I know some really great gay people and they don't deserve all this condescending attitude regarding their representation in mass media."

Not arguing with this, but what were Hillary's proposals to remedy the root causes you're talking about? It's not really an issue that any politician can address.

On another note (and I can't stand this type of conversation because people will throw ""condescending"" and ""racist"" out if you look at them the wrong way) what role do you think poverty and/or low income played in this? I have family members that are very poor and/or grew up very poor, and they just had no time or worry about following politics. They had more important, pressing issues to spend their time and worry towards. I do think that was a large reason of why minorities went towards Clinton instead of Sanders. It's no secret that they don't have the advantage of old/family money that many white families have, and thus have less wealth on average. Clinton is a household name in this country, Sanders isn't (or wasn't during the primary)."

"> The only evidence we have of wrong doing is the fact that we just don't like Hillary and are looking for her 47% comment, or her Dean Scream or what have you.

The Dean Scream and the 47% comment are two VERY different things...one is an overplayed viral clip (that didn't really even hurt Dean's chances, he was already on the way out) that supposed hurt Dean's campaign, the other was an incredibly condescending comment that revealed what a politician said behind closed doors.

Romney's 47% comment was important - I guess you can argue about whether or not it was ethical to record it, but I think it's incredibly important it was made public. Candidates who say one thing to the public and say something else to the political elites should be held accountable when caught.

I didn't mean that they literally don't have the right to talk about this issue. I meant basically the same thing as what you said, which is that they really aren't the best people to discuss the topic because of their successes. 
 


> You're doing a lot of comparing. Putting the Green brothers on a ""made it"" pedestal. Putting everyone else in a ""pales in comparison"" category. I suppose that's fine if you personally think that the ""made it"" pedestal exists. I think the point of Hank's video was to say that it doesn't. That ""success"" isn't one kind of thing. 
 


I think it's fair to put the Green's on a ""made it"" pedestal. If you want to compare them to the average US citizen, they really do make us pale in comparison when measuring by how many people know them, how much money they make, and the opportunities they have. I mean, how many average US citizens have spoken directly to a US President? Both John and Hank fall into that category. But that's just a metric. I disagree with the notion that this pedestal doesn't exist, because there's a measurable difference between the quality of the Greens' life and the average Nerdfighter's. We may be on an even playing field, but our actions and life situations give us advantage and disadvantage, and the Greens are sitting atop a pretty big vantage point. 
 


> I feel like Hank was encouraging defining your 'success' based on happiness rather than ""making it"" based on fame or economic status or the standards of other people, because all of that will be gone. 
 


You're completely right that ""success"" can be defined based on a person's subjective happiness. I'd argue that is what most of us are basing our own success on. But I feel that Hank's video is downplaying the importance of those people in the 1% of extraordinary experience. I feel that the Greens should be pushing us to achieve more, and not settle for what makes only ourselves happy. 
 


> I have no desire to be remembered. Nor do I 'pale in comparison' to the Greens. I will never achieve any of the social accomplishments they have. Not even close. And I would never want to, because that's not how I want to live my life. If I can get to the point where I can lead ""an average, ordinary life with a regular job and invariable routine, planned holidays, an average household...., etc"" That would be incredible and a huge achievement for me. That's relative to my own experience. 
 


All true. If you don't want to be remembered, that's totally okay because no one can tell you how to live your life. We all live subjective lives and are all striving towards our own goals. I just feel that for those of us who feel the same way as that Tumblr post, those who want to be remembered, it's kind of frustrating hearing John and Hank tell us to not worry about it, when they so clearly have hit the jackpot that we want. 
 


> But they shouldn't compare themselves to the Greens or anyone else, because again... you define your own success. The universe does not define it for you. Because SuccessTM doesn't exist. It's an arbitrary construct.
 

 
I feel that SuccessTM is a very real thing. Although it's totally defined by whoever is interpreting it, I believe there's a substantial group of people who think that SuccessTM can be defined as how many people whose lives you changed, or how many people will mourn your death, or how much money you donate to charity, so on and so forth ad nauseam.

">Linux desktop users are usually protective and proud of the learning curve they had to endure. As soon as any distribution even approaches being simple for the masses, it's mocked and looked down upon.

God this is so true. I've loved linux for many many years but holy shit does the community never change. They look down on seasoned computer users who stick to Windows but are so fucking unhelpful and condescending to people trying to switch over. It's completely ass-backwards and yet for years they were always declaring ""no, this will be the year of the Linux desktop!"" as if people were going to grow past the many mass of potential frustrations. They didn't even have a usable, accessible driver for Broadcom wireless equipment (which are in pretty much every laptop ever) until just a couple years ago. There's a crazy lack of self-awareness.

My favorite example was about 4 years back. Arch Linux used to have a graphical installer that was easy to follow and let you knock out a basic installation in like half an hour. At one point, they decided to abandon it because it was a buggy, barely workable piece of shit - which is understandable - but instead of making something better, they replaced it with some scripting system that required you to either memorize a ton of obtuse commands or consult the Wiki every time you wanted to just get it working at the most basic functional level. When people complained, they were looked down upon. When people suggested making a version of their own, they were looked down upon. If someone compared Arch's new process to Gentoo, people lost their shit. If you didn't understand the advantage of this over the old system, it wasn't because Arch went through a sudden unpopular change, it was that you were just so obviously stupid.

I still love Arch but the vile attitude of the community over something so simple, more than the change itself, turned me off of actively using it for fear of being viewed as an asshole for associating with people like this.

And on Linux as whole, when things changed for the better (ditching the piece of shit initscripts hackjob for systemd, or replacing the network settings with a simpler Cisco-style syntax - things that a typical Facebook machine user would hopefully never care about), it caused so much drama with the old-timers and their refusal to change.

">He had a victim complex.

Understood. Well that's your relationship and I won't presume to know more about him than you. It's sad that you didn't have a pleasant relationship with him.

That said, the point is that you're still attaching conditions to when it is 'acceptable' for men to express their emotions etc.

This is the fundamental problem. When women (again speaking generally, not necessarily in your specific context) tell men to ""talk more about their feelings"" a lot of the time they are only prepared to let this happen in very small amounts, and only in ways that they find endearing or in ways that don't challenge their preconceptions. The average woman is not attracted to men who ""whine"" or have a ""victim complex"" so in other words the incentives still align with the kind of stoicism which at least sometimes becomes toxic. This is why ""men, talk about your feelings"" is often a trap... because most women don't want men who are honest and open about their feelings. 

>I mean, toxic discussion is toxic regardless of the audience. Neonazis talking among themselves is still a problem, especially if they get a steady flow of members attracted by aspects of their beliefs.

You're implicitly treating ideas as viruses, as diseases, as things that ""happen to"" other people's minds. You are thinking that people ""become"" Nazis because of ""exposure"" to contagious ideas. But people don't become convinced of ideas in the same way they get infected by a disease. Either they must (rightly or wrongly) genuinely think the idea is true, and/or the idea must be significant to their utility (for instance the idea must fulfill their psycho-social needs, and the benefits of believing the idea must outweigh the costs) for them to believe it. 

Mere exposure to an idea does not constitute persuasion. The idea that neonazis talking amongst themselves is going to necessarily result in totalitarianism is frankly a ludicrous model of memetics. We all learn about Nazi ideology in high school and the details of it are public knowledge yet hardly anyone in today's society actually believes it. 

Unless said ""nazis talking amongst themselves"" involves conspiracy or the incitement of imminent violent action, they're just odious people ranting in their little corner of the internet.

>I personally don't think the rape movement has gone 'too far.' Is there some collateral damage..? I guess? Some people might be getting falsely accused. 

Oh yes, all those destroyed lives are just 'collateral damage' 'you guess'. This attitude is so monstrously contemptuous of a very important part of our justice system: we deliberately weight the system in favor of the accused precisely because we believe it is more important to avoid 'collateral damage' than to make sure the guilty are always punished 100% of the time. Better that a hundred guilty go free than one innocent be punished (as Benjamin Franklin paraphrased Sir William Blackstone). 

Plenty of men's lives have been greatly damaged, if not ruined, by false allegations, and movements like MeToo have made it possible to defame people on social media with unprecedentedly low costs. You write this all off as ""collateral damage."" Tell that to every one of the young men on the Duke Lacrosse team that got railroaded by Mike Nifong (who was pandering to left-wing identitarianism in order to advance his political career). Meanwhile, Emma Sulkowicz gets celebrated as an absolute heroine (by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand IIRC) even though a campus kangaroo court with no protections for the accused and a low burden of proof couldn't substantiate the rape allegations she made against Paul Nungesser (spelling may be off here). 

>people who say you should believe the woman no matter what... They have a point. It's incredibly difficult for a woman to come up and say that she's been raped. She wouldn't d it unless she had a good reason to.

This is insane. Yes, it may be hard going to the cops about something. But there are plenty of crimes that it is hard to go talk to the cops about; rape is not the only crime that leaves the victim in an emotionally shredded state. Let's say I was out on a romantic evening with my partner, and someone comes up and shoots said partner in cold blood in front of my eyes, and threatens to kill me next if I go to the cops. Yeah, it would be emotionally difficult to get over that fear. But stop pretending rape is a special case... especially when its a matter of official policy to treat female rape victims with complete belief, and yet we still live in a society where the possibility that women can rape men is habitually denied (including by some feminists, such as Mary Koss, who defines the most common form of female rape of men as ""not really rape"").

Trauma is no excuse. And even so, we live in a world where rape allegations or vague allegations of 'unspecified sexual misconduct' don't even have to go through the official legal system to destroy a man's life. Social media. News reports. Even if the charges get thrown out of court reputations can stick. 

The idea that a woman would never lie about rape is frankly insane. There are always costs to filing false police reports irrespective of the crime, although rape for some reason seems to get an exception because prosecutors are so paranoid about deterring ""real victims"" from coming forward that they habitually excuse false accusers and let them off with a slap on the wrist. 

We've even seen documented instances of women fabricating rape threats and sending those threats to themselves as a way to get attention and ""start a conversation"" (Meg Lanker-Symons at University of Wyoming, I believe). Yes, there are women who lie about rape, and we're currently in a cultural moment that is creating incentives for them to do it. 

Of course not all women lie about rape. Thankfully it is only a minority of women who have the kind of atrocious moral character required to do such a thing. By the same token, it is also a minority of men who have the kind of atrocious depravity required to be a rapist, yet the ""rape culture"" movement is basically demanding that all male spaces and institutions be restructured along feminist lines because of this bizarre idea that standard-issue male culture encourages men to rape women. 

>But that said, I think there should be a case and everything and evidence shown to support the man's case that he didnt rape.

This is basically true with one exception; the burden of proof is always on the prosecutor, not the defendant. The accused should never have to prove their innocence, it is up to the prosecution to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

But even so, we have for several years had a campus Title IX regimen that essentially turned campus sexual assault trials into Star-Chamber kangaroo courts. The standard of proof was ""preponderance of the evidence"" and none of the standard criminal law safeguards were followed. You want a trial? What happened in such tribunals was not anything approximating the idea of a trial (i.e. due process under law).

>The good thing about all these movements is that it's changing society and women are actually coming forward and talking about their experience now.

Yes, I'm sure Asia Argento's behavior has done so much good for survivors...

>Men too, boys who were raped are talking about it a lot more. It's doing a lot more good than bad which is why feminists get upset when MRA takes a hostile stance towards things like metoo.

Men and boys who are/were victims of rape have been trying to talk about it for decades, but were essentially forced out of the discussion by feminists (such as Mary Koss). Don't you even dare try to give the credit for rising awareness of the sexual assault and rape of men to #MeToo... a hashtag which was always really about the ""Casting Couch"" experiences of women in Hollywood. 

>I mean a lot of those insults aren't exactly shaming them for not being manly. Most of them are shaming 'losers.' 

This is not merely womansplaining, it is so obviously wrong I barely know where to begin.

A ""loser"" or ""nerd"" or ""virgin"" or ""neckbeard"" or whatever is an unmanly man. Men are, in our society, meant to be strong and powerful winners and are meant to crush puss and be tough and athletic and blah blah blah. ""Loser"" is an inherently emasculating insult. This is completely obvious. It's equivalent to accusing a man of having a tiny cock. 

You're a woman. Have you been subject to the same kind of socialization that males are? No? Then stop womansplaining.

>You could direct the same insults (but tailor them for women like a neckbeard equivalent) and it would be the same.

Oh really? What, pray tell, is the feminine equivalent of neckbeard? 

Because I don't know any feminine equivalent to ""neckbeard"" or ""manbaby"" or ""manchild"" or any of these other inherently emasculating insults. 

>If you aren't participating properly in society (as an adult with a job who contributed, has friends, romantic partners, etc.) you will be mocked - male or female.

Men are under waaaaay more pressure to be heavy careerists than women are. Its still acceptable for women to be stay-at-home homemakers or to basically mooch off boyfriend money. If she hasn't gotten married yet or doesn't have any boyfriends then the women's press will manufacture excuses for her, that men are pigs who don't want her because men are shallow and refuse to commit blah blah blah. 

Seriously, I don't know if this conversation can continue at this point. If you think that ""loser"" isn't inherently emasculating you're just... at the very least you have not even the slightest understanding of how the gender norms operate for men in general. "

"I want to respond to this because I deeply identify with it, and I feel the need to clarify my meaning. 

I am a pit-dweller myself. I have lived in a variety of different pits for longer than I can count. My reasons for believing that realizing is possible within a pit don't come from naivety or optimism. They come from my own embarrassingly long struggle to climb out of all these pits I'm constantly getting trapped in.

Realizing when you're stuck in a pit is absolutely possible—it just doesn't immediately do anything to get you out of the pit. 

In my experience, that part takes a lot of trying and failing and observing yourself and testing out different ways of thinking. It isn't easy or fast, and the process is probably somewhere between slightly and extremely different for everybody. It has been particularly difficult for me. We're talking four hundred times more failure than success. As soon as I feel like I've mastered it, I slip back and realize how much I never knew in the first place. The amount of times I have failed to realize I am trapped in a pit FAR exceeds the amount of times I have succeeded. 

> It's like telling someone underwater to take a deep breath.

I see it more like telling someone underwater that the surface exists. The existence of the surface doesn't make them able to breathe. I can't even necessarily say what direction it is relative to where you are (since I don't know very much about your location). But knowing it exists can be helpful. 

I also understand the feeling of not wanting to be told there's a different way. It makes it seem like the person saying that thinks the way you're doing it now is wrong, and change is easy, and why aren't you different yet? And that is often the case—people tend to assume things that are easy for them should be easy for everybody, or that they know enough about everyone else's problems to solve them better, or that the fact that simple truths exist also means simple solutions exist, and it's just a matter of flipping a switch and now you're different. 

But I know nothing about you, specifically. I certainly don't know what this feels like for you or how hard it should be for you or anything like that. But I know what it feels like for me, and people are very similar underneath the layer of details, and I hope that if I share my experience, maybe the basic similarities will allow others to use parts of what I learned to make their own boats/ladders/airplanes/whatever they want to make. 

Anyway, I apologize if I came off as preachy or condescending in any of this. I understand what pits are like, and the fact that I still live in most of mine coupled with how hard I'm trying is proof that it isn't easy to stay out of them. "
"> He repeatedly threw players under the bus, or blamed the fans for not understanding how soccer works.

Klinsmann wasn't diplomatic in the way he did things, and if he ever looks back and wonders why he got fired, that should be towards the top of any list he makes. 

That being said: he tried to call attention to the fact that professional footballers should be able to be counted on to put in real work, know basic strategy, not need to be reminded how to play their position, etc. After watching the same group of players under Arena, I didn't see much to see that his criticisms of the players were unfair or unwarranted.

As far as the fans - it's not a good idea to be condescending, but the #1 criticism of Jurgen Klinsmann is that he played players out of position. It's repeated ad nauseum as though he's the only person to ever do it, when in reality international soccer means picking a few guys to play their ideal styles and asking everyone else to adjust. He should've expressed it better, but it has to be exhausting to be constantly criticized for doing what is quite literally something every coach in international soccer has to do. Otherwise, you call in guys like Villafana to play left back because he's the best left back in your pool, even though Fabian Johnson can play left back 10 times better than Villafana can."
"> Do you realize that calling people whores for having sex is a way of shaming them?

I think that's subjective, and saying things like ""Now you know for next time"" because you're offended over their choice of word is condescending. Never mind the passive aggressive ""What's that? You touch kids? I don't even know if it's true, but I won't judge you"" attitude of subtly undermining someone else by making them seem like an intolerant bigot.

I see your point, thanks for the analysis. I put a lot of value into honest feedback.

I just don't think I could be happy watering down the details to make an appeal to emotion. I always try to present a scientific topic in an accessible way but not in a condescending way, be it my personal research or other topics like agricultural and food policy. 

I comment on these topics to bring the facts to an emotional topic. I am trying to give the rational minority the information they need to make an educated opinion of their own. 

>they are already in a negative frame of mind.

There are a lot of conspiracy theory level paranoia surrounding agricultural policy. However, I think this will change considerably in the next decade. The first GM traits are coming out of patent, and it will fundamentally change how genetic modification operates. It will remove the corporate influence from the beneficial technology.

>It is understandable, no? Why believe Monsanto and other companies about the viability and safety of GMOs when they have already gone out of their way to be vile, power-hungry, greed-ridden asshats? Any credibility of GMO science is severely diminished, and despite my background in Geoscience and Ecology, I find it difficult sometimes myself.

I am skeptical as well, but I let my opinion be guided by the evidence and the opinions of independent experts. If the scientific consensus (which I define as the expert opinions and evidence summarized in comprehensive reviews) says it is safe and beneficial, it probably is. I try to present these facts and expert opinions to others to let them decide for themselves."

I was a newbie, took all the safety talk at my workplace to heart, to the point that from after two weeks, I wanted my gov. career to be in health and safety, and was so fucking let down when I actually got onto work floor to find that most that shit was thrown out the window.

"> There has been a lot of ""science"" over the years that has been accepted as fact and then proven to be completely wrong.

I would challenge you to come up with examples of theories discovered using the scientific method that have ""proven to be 'completely wrong'"". That's a trick challenge, of course, because by necessity, scientific theories have explanatory, predictive power. They're never ""wrong"" (barring statistically impossible conspiracies); they're just incomplete. They can't be ""wrong"" because they only explain what we've repeatedly observed and tested and make no claims further than that. Newton's Laws aren't ""wrong""; we still use them every day and teach them to our students. Aside from minor adjustments for Relativity, Newton's Laws got us to the moon and back. We just discovered that very small particles behave differently. The same applies to Relativity and the speed of light. Nobody is stubbornly asserting that we'll never discover a way that faster-than-light travel could be possible; it just doesn't match our current, known-to-be-incomplete models (with the exception of crazy quantum mechanics which I won't pretend to understand). This idea of scientists being stubbornly sure of themselves is so polar opposite of everyday reality that I can only imagine that the perception stems from Hollywood or elsewhere in the media. If you actually talk to a group of scientists, they're full of doubt, uncertainty, allowing for unforeseen possibilities at every turn. That's the nature of science; to embrace the unknown. To embrace our ignorance--because it doesn't serve science to pretend that we have the answers. That's the realm of religion.

> You have said that God, by definition, cannot exist because he violates the laws of physics.

I never said this.

> accepting one guy's opinion on something because he has used some form of science to justify it and dismissing another because he uses faith or simply personal experience is kind of silly.

Sure, that's why we have the peer review process, scientific consensus, etc. I wouldn't blindly trust some random scientist or I'd end up believing that vaccines caused autism or that the evolution of life was statistically impossible.

> I hope I've helped you to see my point of view a little in return.

It certainly has made me think more about whether or not we're ready to move beyond superstitious thinking. It doesn't make these beliefs any more true or justified (and really, their rationality isn't a matter of opinion--it's either justified or not), but it may be that some people simply ( >pardon how condescending this sounds< ) could not function as well in the world without some sort of comforting delusion.

What if they support another holocaust? If someone has horrid beliefs but doesn't act on them where do we draw the line?

>Tribalism exists for a reason. It wouldn't be there if it didn't serve a purpose. Being trained not to be tribal hasn't worked out so well for us if we're being honest.

Sorry but that is the most ignorant thing you have said in this entire discussion. Literally all of peaceful civilization exists because of a limitation or rejection of tribalism.

Also, simply existing does not mean something has a purpose. Male nipples, tapeworms, mosquitos, botflies and most insects, the weird places that humans have hair, brown M&Ms, and that's just things that don't seem to do much of anything useful. If you include things that might have a purpose or only a weak reason to exist you can include the human appendix, wisdom teeth, tailbone, chihuahuas, petroleum, and more.


I don't want to sound insulting or condescending, so please try not to see this as an attack. From the conversation we've had it appears as though you are on the edge of having a victim mentality. You have presented an image of widespread persecution without providing solid evidence. The improvement to the rights, freedoms, or life of one group does not dictate a reduction of those things from other groups. I agree with you that poor whites have probably received some of the least attention in recent times. But when someone says black people are frequently targets of discrimination it does not mean that no other people are discriminated against.


There are clear and present problems in our culture that absolutely need to be fixed across all political, ideological, whatever spectrums. The pendulum has begun to swing and it is our duty to avoid the extremes that these cultural shifts bring. Those feminists that are anti-men should be rejected just as strongly as those that are anti-women. Please do not let the wave of anger and frustration draw you in to make the same mistakes as our predecessors.

">It sounds like you’re advocating for a small child at the age of 8 to be autonomous in his decisions of whats best for him, 

Yeah.

Read about Erikson's theory of developmental stages. (It explains a lot about how stereotypical beta behaviors form)

This is actually critical to young children's development.

I see so many men here with issues with mistrust (especially of themselves) shame, guilt, self-doubt, and inferiority.

That all develops from age 1-9, after which it's very difficult to break such thinking habits.

It's typically a result of controlling, condescending parental figures, who don't take time to talk deeply to their kids about their needs and wishes.

>What youre into as a kid is likely what youll develop and grow into your teens and then into adulthood. 

I sure did.

When I was in grade school I was into violent video games. Mortal Kombat, Postal, the original DOOM. Don't know if that tells you anything. I saw plenty of classic 70's and 80 R-rated action movies. Lots of violent role-playing and fighting with my siblings. Plenty of shooting guns off in the woods with my uncles.

So, naturally, I grew up to be a submachine gun toting rapist berserker, with gender identity conflict.

You wanna know why I didn't do that? Because I put as many things as I could grab, into my mouth and NOW I HAVE IMMUNITY TO THAT CRAP!

Also, I'm not a psychopath/sociopath that makes a huge difference.

That is oh so wrong, I wrote what I wrote because I saw people reference this web meme, and take it seriously. I decided to put effort into refuting it, even though I originally felt sympathy for the misguided arrogance of the author. I had to tone down my language, so it wouldn’t sound totally condescending and appear completely dismissive, because there are so many logical inconsistencies in this text which are completely laughable to most serious psychedelic people (or my peer group say) 

>His is a religious indignity, going so far as to say that anyone disagreeing with him is less conscious and enlightened than himself and anyone with whom he agrees, an obvious ""no true scotsman"" fallacy. While a relevant counterpoint, it's overflowing with contradictions, showing no end to the mental gymnastics and cognitive dissonance he is willing to suffer to defend what was not actually attacked in the first place. 

It is not about defending anything, but deconstructing an argument, and showing it up to be foolish gobbledy gook. 

>This text is however useful in illustrating certain biases against a measured analysis of mental phenomena. It's the same sort of reaction you see to research into consciousness in general, which is an underlying assumption that rational explanation invalidates subjective experience. 

Sounds like schizophrenia to me. You would ideally want the explanation which is rational to fit and correlate closely to the subjective experience. 

AND You really think James Kent explanation is rational? Looks to me like he is desperate to find some sort of explanation that fits - and it is not actually a rational explanation. Actually, I find his position to be irrational and my position to be rational.
 
Lets be clear here. Rational does not mean credulous. Rational does not mean, that which fits within the rules of the present human understanding of phenomena circa 2015. Rational does not mean materialist or that which has cut away any “paranormal” theory, just because the paranormal is not normal and apparently does not exist according to certain systems of understanding. 

Rational is the metered use of logic and reason, it is the ability to think sensibly. I’m sure JK can think sensibly about some things, about DMT he is way off beam and all over the shop. Hopefully I have made that point clear. I honestly believe the old chap has potential, but he’s too caught up in his canonical decrees to truly and clearly communicate the circumstance. 

Unfortunately, the human world is full of people who are in denial of their spiritual nature, and take refuge in their mental faculties, and have little innate apprehension of spiritual realities. DMT gives such people a chance to apprehend what is beyond the mind, and then you have their apparent posterboy, JK posting a hare brained schema which positively look inane and unconvincing to those who have their heads screwed on straight. His views are reactively cognitive dissonance in action. 

His words come off as screwey and forced. What he is saying actually doesn’t make any sense if you look closer, as I did. I’d hope after 10 years he’d come clean and apologise for writing such unwise graffiti as if we are supposed to take it seriously. 

>”Random noise"" has a huge part in everything as we know it, from quantum fluctuations to psychic disturbances providing novel insights or at least the thrill of a momentary suspension of one's narrow reality tunnel. 

The assumption here is that there is such a thing as random! A lot of people (including myself) don’t make that assumption. 

>To ring in the new year, I vaporized 50mg of DMT as the clock struck midnight and found myself face to face with alien insectoid creatures dancing elaborately, a dance that kept all of this presumably subatomic activity I saw in sync and the universe (which universe, I'm not sure) running smoothly. It was, as one would expect from DMT, utterly astounding. But I'm not going to start putting down others as unenlightened because they aren't hip to alien bugs doing the watusi with electrons. The experience was neither trivial nor objectively true, in my view. There was a distinct impression of intelligence among these beings, as well as the characteristic intention to communicate with me, but it's also possible to stimulate certain parts of the brain with electricity to consistently produce the sensation of the presence of an entity of some sort. 

Oh yeah, please do tell me about how we too can stimulate the brain ‘with electricity’ and see insectoids as well! Try 86mg next time, 50mg is just about where the fun really starts. 

>The experience itself is authentic, for there is no such thing as a false experience, but there is nothing open-minded about turning the unusual into an unquestionable truth.

What about just accepting the unusual as it is? As it appears to be? It is not about “unquestionable truth”, it is about accepting phenomena on its own terms and being rational about it. 

Terence McKenna once said that saying it was not real, was in bad taste, it was just not the done thing. I agree with him. If there is an element of righteousness in my words, it is that there has been a major breach of ettiquette here, a communication in bad taste which should not taken seriously by sensible people. (and generally is not actually) 

>Biology and psychology can show us certain biases to the conclusions we draw from our experiences. I've noticed people often have visceral reactions to someone pointing out the finer details of how aspects of the psychedelic experience occur, quite similar to a religious fundamentalist. At the heart of things, people are often afraid that if they shine the light too directly on that which seems most important, they will find that there was nothing active there at all. 

Not sure what the author is saying there, “there was nothing active there at all”??? Sounds like classic JK gobbodly gook nonsense to me. 

>Never mind that any light you shine will always be reflected back to you. As Frank Herbert so eloquently stated, fear is the mind killer. There may be something there after all and maybe it is stranger than even the goofiest kook likes to imagine, despite it fitting easily within a scientific framework. 

ditto. 

>Anyone who sees scientific explanation as simplifying phenomena has willfully resisted the true complexity that unchained curiosity reveals. 

Unchained curiosity doesn’t attempt to dismiss something as momentus and astounding as DMT with a hare brained theory that reeks of screwey crankdom. 

>The problem is that vague ideas seem complex to those who do not truly explore them, for when an idea has no clear boundaries it is easy to imagine that it goes on forever.

JK is quagmired in wannabe scientism, that’s the disease of our age, just as dogmatic catholicism was the disease of western europe hundreds of years ago. Both stances side in the theoretical and certain, and that is dangerous to the progression of ideas and the exploration of truth and needs to be pointed out as such.

Your attitude, and the attitude of other Clinton supporters in this thread is a prime example of what actually made Clinton lose. Hillary's attitude the entire time was condescending and entitled, just as her supporters acted.

I voted for her despite that, and there's no proof that rightfully disillusioned Bernie supporters had anything to do with Trump winning. It was because the DNC tipped the scales in favor of a lame horse candidate that was already polling way lower than Bernie against Trump. He was projected to win 59% to 40% while she was 50% and 49% with Trump. You dug your own graves and still repeat the same lies and propaganda that got us all into this mess.

"> Re-writing Minecraft in C++ wouldn't be a port. It would require completely re-writing the game engine, which itself is integrated into the actual game of Minecraft itself, making things that much more of a pain in the ass.

Not at all. Java and C++ work with similar data types, the hard part would be memory management and a little elbow grease. Not hard at all. Relative to Windows, it's nothing. Don't be condescending about programming experience, here. Much (80-90%) of the port from Java to C++ could be done with simple lexical analysis.

Java and C++ are pretty damn close. Wherever you're getting your idea that they're drastically different is just wrong. The only complication would be memory management, but that's pretty much a solved problem in C++ in 2014 (we have libraries that make it as automatic as it is in Java).

Technical limitations. Do some basic mathematics. When you start getting 3D volumes of data, plus large event handlers meaning dynamic arrays of all event blocks such as redstone, plant growth, etc., you grow CPU and memory demands very fast. Have you ever looked at your task manager while Minecraft is running? It's often more memory intensive than AAA high-graphics releases. As it stands now they have to hackjob quite a bit of Minecraft just to make it run on crappier computers.

"> which my head is like 'dude, I just told u that'... Could be that I'm too technical and people interviewing me aren't...

That's a good point. You are marketing yourself right now. So you need to be able to make yourself understood to the people who you are talking to. How does your skill at [technical speak about what you do] affect their department or their job. Remember that the person interviewing you does not want to feel stupid, so you have to be careful to not assume that they know all the same definitions as you do. More importantly, you also have to assume that they MIGHT, so if you feel the need to simplify, don't do it in a way that they might feel like you are talking down to them.

Instead of saying in your head ""Dude, I just told you that"" You NEED to be saying to yourself, ""how do I explain this is such a way that they can know that what I just said is basically this, but do it in a way that doesn't seem condescending?""

Okay, so if I came across as all high-and-mighty, that's probably my fault. I don't know if you will believe me, but my intention was not to be condescending at all, because I don't see myself as smart enough to condescend to anyone. 

This part of your post made me think:

>Come on man, you are degrading strippers by saying that any reference to a stripper must be degrading. It's like saying ""how dare you call that man black, that's racist!""

So...everything is really contextual, you know? The post that I was originally replying to just said something like, ""I don't take my parenting advice from strippers."" And maybe I'm an American living in the midwest who has known too many guys that will go to strip clubs but then, in the light of day, totally denigrate any woman who strips. And the men are given passes because no one knows or the ""boys-will-be-boys"" excuse is made.

But, no, I'm not saying that any reference to a stripper must be degrading. I'm not saying that. I'm saying that the way that I interpreted the post that I referenced seemed degrading towards strippers, and I'm saying that American culture generally does not look well on strippers, though we don't really criticize the men who patronize strippers and make their jobs profitable. 

>There's nothing wrong with stripping, but let's not assume that any given stripper is qualified to give advice about vaccination - especially when said advice is directly contrary to scientific consensus.

His intended audience in this article is those who agree with him though, that's the entire premise. 

> So? What does knowing about ballistics or cleaning their own game have to do with any of this? You don't need to have any experience with either to support firearm ownership. That phrase serves no purpose other than to show how he is better than the professors at that party

In the context of the gun debate, it does hold meaning. Those who usually support gun control know nothing about firearms, but think they have enough know how to tell you what ammunition, parts, features or even looks are dangerous and should therefore be banned. The recent M855 ammo controversy should be a great illustrator of that. So yes, you don't need to know those topics he mentions to support firearm ownership, but if you oppose such ownership, you should at least have an idea of why you oppose it, saying 'because!' or 'it looks scary!' is not a good reason which is how I viewed his point. 

> Addtionally, the exchange between him and the history professor is full of ""emotional"" language. Does the reader really need to know what kind of drink the professor has? Or is it there to paint the professor as one of those dreaded intellectuals?

> At a party for your wife's colleagues? Less appropriate.

I don't recall him telling the professor that he was using emotionally or logically flawed arguments. I only saw him conveying that to the readers, which was factual. 

> Also, don't make the mistake of thinking that the ""pro-gun"" side cant be similarly emotionally charged.

It is an emotionally charged issue. We are generally talking about matters of life and death. The difference is one side predicates their entire argument on the basis of emotion, devoid of facts.

No, it really isn't. There are plenty of ridiculous pro-gun articles that appeal to emotion, and this certainly wasn't one of them.

> Both occurred at the same time, but that doesn't mean that one necessarily caused the other. It does tell us that more guns does not equal more crime, which is a very important and convincing conclusion, but there is a distinction there.

The ""more guns do not equal more crime"" is the proper argument in my mind as well, but it doesn't invalidate the ""more guns equal less crime"" either. I posted an article a few weeks back by a Chuck Michel (NRA West Coast counsel) which discussed the purchase of firearms (specifically handguns) in CA were at all time highs, while crime is at all time lows and continuing to drop. He made a great point in saying that you can't definitively say that more guns is causing the drop in crime—but that most people are purchasing their guns for self-defense, does bring some context to ownership vs crime. 

> The point of a discussion over differing opinions isn't to ""win"", or show the other person all the ways they're wrong, or even to try to convert the person to your point of view; it's to find a mutual understanding.

There is no mutual understanding on this issue. There just isn't. One side isn't giving their guns up and the other side wants to see those guns limited or taken away. If you've really debated with an anti, you'd see this. Say that you hate seeing children die, and get lectured how you are supporting their deaths because you support 'BigGun'. I posted a debate vid from Larry King's show with Chuck Michel from the NRA debate the Director of Women Against Gun Violence and the exact same thing happened.

You make it sound so easy. It's so easy to convince them you're a great person when they think you are: paranoid, nuts, afraid, a baby killer, racist, misogynist, anti-government, mentally ill...shall I go on? All of that because I own a firearm (God help if you own multiple guns) and believe in protecting myself. 

> That'll go further than facts

No it won't. They don't care how great you are. They are conditioned to believe that 'guns are bad', period. Your personality is irrelevant to this. If you really think this debate is over how each side treats each other, you may want to look around more carefully. Go to an anti-gun subreddit and use that hospitality and see how you are treated. Oh, that's if you don't get banned first for not even meeting their posting 'requirements'. Then see how long you last for supporting the 2A. Contrast that with /r/progun, /r/gunpolitics and this sub. Debate and diverging viewpoints is welcomed and I've only seen abusive trolls banned in the pro subs.

"> The patriarchy gets a bad rep, because people assume it's only about women. When you study the concept, you realize that—despite what YouTube insists—its proponents are also interested in helping men.

The problem is, whoever popularized this term decided it should have called a word that means ""rulership by men"".

There is a huge perception that modern, third wave feminism frames women as victims and men as purpetrators of injustice and seeks societal change on those terms, and just like every activist group, lies about its true intentions, that they really just hate men and want to attack them using social pressure rather than bullets, and attempts to try and explain the meaning of the terms they use is just a smoke screen for this true purpose.

The same observation can be said of other terms, such as ""toxic masculinity"", or ""man-everything"" (mansplaining, manspreading, manexisting, etc). They are framed, in a linguistic sense, to place men as the villains. Same-same in reverse for ""feminism""; literally ""the philosophy of femininity"". This frames the movement as being ""for women"", so saying men stand to benefit too may well be true, but only as a secondary benefit away from the main focus and, if push comes to shove, the movement is going to stand with women over any men's issue.

It's like if the Men's Rights Movement had popularized an issue with ""FemLying"" but then tried to explain that women's lies affect women too, and that when women lie about things it takes away from women telling the truth so all women should also take a stand against FemLying because they stand to benefit as well.

Just as people reading this are already using that > key to quote the above paragraph and scream at me for implying women are liars, the choice to subtly frame things like toxic masculinity, mansplaining, and patriarchy as male-purpetrated issues causes people to reject it instinctively because most people simply do not enjoy being indirectly blamed, as a collective, for something they feel they as an individual didn't do or aren't responsible for.

I know a common response to this is ""why do people care what word we use?"", to which I usually respond, ""sure, well, let's call it 'matriarchy' or 'all-women-are-lying-whores-ocracy' then if it doesn't matter."" Yet somehow there is a strange reluctance to do this.

I feel people would be much more happy to discuss patriarchy theory, and mansplaining and toxic masculinity and other issues if they were not consistently presented as issues where men were the bad guys."

> I personally love the idea of what the brain could be capable of with evolutional or manipulation, etc.

What the brain does best is interpret complex information, and tell important details apart from background noise. Use technology to add external capabilities, and training to set professionals apart from civilians.

If you want telepathy, there are several plausible ways:

 Mentalists, who learn through training to read and influence people in subtle but non-magical ways, such as microexpressions. This is entirely real. An agency full of highly trained mentalists could be used to do social engineering on a massive scale.
 Some people have a form of synesthesia that causes them to see facial expressions as auras. Hide the face, no aura. Not surprisingly, they're really good at reading people's emotions. This is also entirely real.
 People with brain-machine interfaces could perhaps communicate thoughts via radio.
 We've had sensors capable of sensing brain waves for many years, and it's possible to use them to get an idea what someone is thinking. Brain waves are very complex, and vary a lot between individuals, so a lot of calibration is needed. Still, it seems plausible to me that a trained operator with sensors interfaced to their own brain could calibrate in real time and get useful information.

Telekinesis isn't possible, but then tractor beams and contragravity aren't either. If your universe has such technologies, making a ""weak"" but portable version available could mimic TK. The power source would have to be strong enough for the mass you want to move, of course. Again, training could allow some to be highly skilled at using it with finesse, just like with forklift operators or safe crackers.

I thought these two posts were really insightful:

>[I have commented a couple of times on here regarding this type of issue, but I wouldn't characterize my comments as accusing SRS of engaging in classism. What really bothers me about how SRS tends to treat class issues is that most SRSers don't take into account how class privilege alters the way that other privileges work. For example, a lot of male privileges only come into effect when they are paired with class privilege. It doesn't make much sense to talk about things like the prevalence of male CEO's under the broad heading of ""male privilege"", because only the tiniest subset of men are in a position where this privilege can come into play. The fact that rich white men are CEOs doesn't really help poor black men, yet all men (or whatever privileged group you want to name) are often tarred with the same brush.]( http

">it is possible to extract nuggets of wisdom and intelligence from anyone who can be sarcastically patronizing.

That you could do with anyone.

Sarcasm usually is a sign of a person not having anything better to say.
It's the easiest way to feel superior. Using sarcasm is simply a cop out. 

It's a way of saying ""I don't know how to convince you, so I will try to insult your intelligence to make others laugh at you."". Most of the time stupid people try to use it to bring the audience on their side when they have no actual argumenation to provide. It's also very hard to get out of such a situation as stupidity is infectious and you can't win against a crowd already fixed like that, making it one of the most pathetic attempts to make yourself seem superior.

I very rarely see sarcasm from an actually intelligent person. A really intelligent person usually simply knows better and can keep the conversation going, bringing forth more and more argumentation... until the stupid person finally exposes him/herself as wrong... or bring the stupid person to a point where he/she begins to start getting sarcastic/patronizing/condescending, in which case you simply know that the person has nothing left to say."
">I have seen the white outline shaped like a mass production Evangelion (from the opening of 1.0) explained away as likely one of the angels that were defeated before Shinji got there (the 3rd angel in rebuild that Mari kills in 2.0 I think) but I don't really think that shot alone works as foreshadowing of that as it's shaped nothing like the thing and gives no suggestion that the thing might be a future threat.

Personally, I find any conclusion drawn from the white lines to be highly speculative whether it is related to continuity theory with MPU or some other theory regarding angels. But it seems rather strange to me that people would automatically assume that ti's lines of MPU and use as supporting argument for continuation theory.

Things like cryptic lines from Kaworu. It's bound to be highly interpretive as we know very little about him in general. I don't have any issue with his lines being used to support continuation theory.

>I'd certainly put the continuation theory much lower on the fanwank scale than most other theories that rely on a tonne of assumptions usually based on a single detail overly focused on and fanwanked to fit everywhere.

I admit that most theories are highly speculative in their nature. I mean we don't have much to go by. It's only natural.

The problem I have with continuation theory is that a lot of people base their support on things that are clearly debunked by Rebuild narrative already. But they still want to somehow work it into fit the theory. For example. Red ocean was explicitly explained in 2.22 by Kaji. Ocean used to be blue, red ocean is simply result of Second Impact of Rebuild continuity which had far greater environmental impact (pun not intended) than one happened in NGE. But some people argue that red ocean is due to Third Impact of NGE universe. This is what I meant by fan wanking.

I was simply stating that some of the continuation theories that ignores the established narrative of Rebuild. To tell you the truth, I will probably remain skeptical of continuation theory unless someone can come up with a convincing theory regarding discrepancy of Adam vs Adams and origin of Rebuild's Unit 1 which was lost in space by end of EoE.

Those two are fundamentally important in shaping mechanics of Impacts and the narrative that I feel without explaining the two, I have hard time swallowing any type of bridging between two continuities.

I have good trade relations with a few people in my leagues now and I can't tell you how nice and refreshing it is to send a message to someone letting them know I have interest in a trade and knowing that I'm going to get an honest and fair trade offer straight away without having to needlessly argue values or deal with weak low balls or play around with transparent manipulative salesman bullshit tactics where guys try to milk that extra 2nd rounder out of you on an even value and mutually beneficial deal because they think they have 'leverage' since you approached them, etc...

No I said that what they are doing is saving immediate expenditures at the cost of future profit and ethical treatment of their customers.

They are putting off the DLC so they can save money NOW instead of potentially making money LATER. It is an extremely common practice for a poorly run business. They know they wont be able to create an equal version for the PS3, which will cause them to spend even more money fixing it even after release, so they are cutting their losses and giving up on it. They are choosing to look unethical instead of just inept. They get away with this because people like you argue with people like me instead of realizing that what I want is good for you too. "
">I'm aware, it's simply that many people who respond to my posts in this thread do so with palpable condescension.

The reason you're receiving condescension here is because you're using tired old arguments that people are sick of debunking. Either you aren't aware or you're knowingly using sub par arguments.

>Assuming the existence of god creates a reason for the existence of everything else. Only one assumption is made.

Actually, two assumptions are made. Assumption 1: there's a reason that everything exists; Assumption 2: a god is the reason. I make fewer assumptions because I assume that there is no reason for things to exist; they just do.

>Pascals wager: Fair enough, no I had not encountered any of the thousands of debunkings, makes sense though. :)

"> Hey again, haha I'm glad I could engage you in a Bible/StarWars mashup discussion. :) Since you took so much time in your reply I'll give you a few clarifications from my end. But please note that my goal here isn't to ""win"" or have a heated debate. It is clear you know a fair amount about the Bible and Christianity, so I'll try to just mention a few points, hopefully with tact and charity, as I don't want to be a clanging symbol. But like you, I'm glad to defend the Bible and argue Star Wars in the same post. :)

I'm glad to hear that! This has been a fun conversation. It's clear you've done your homework as well. 

> Agreed; I just couldn't resist referencing Pascal's Wager, though, since you mentioned ""doubling down"" in /r/TrueChristian. My reference was intended mostly for amusement rather than serious theological challenge, but I did want to mention it because of what is at stake based on your choice of belief: your soul.

Fair enough; I was perhaps a bit quick to jump on that bit. And while I don't believe that either of us have souls to risk, I do think it'd feel condescending not to give a little pushback to your OP. If we both care about the truth over all else (which I believe to be the case), then we can only gain from a bit of good-natured disagreement. 

> Agreed again, although it is entirely possible he was entrusted with temporary control of the region during the census given that the actual governor at the time, Varus, was so inept. Because Luke was so accurate in the dozens upon dozens of historical facts he mentions in Luke/Acts, I have no problem giving him the benefit of the doubt in this verse, especially because he used the word hegemon not legatus indicating the potential for Quirinius governing in a lesser capacity at that time.

Possible? Maybe; I'm honestly not confident enough in the history to say that it's not possible. I'd still like to see evidence for that claim (or even a scholar defending it outside of apologia) before I can confidently call it possible. 

>Thank you for agreeing that Daniel 11:1-35 is entirely accurate about Aniochus! But for verses 36-45, perhaps I wasn't clear when I mentioned the importance of Biblical prophecy being twofold: near-term and long-term. Verses 1-35 are the near-term prophecy, and verses 36-45 are the long-term prophecy, and we can have confidence that is the case because it's what Jesus said.

Perhaps I wasn't clear about the point I was trying to make. The ""prophecy"" is accurate up until verse 36 because it's writing about things that had already happened at the time it was written. 

Further, I don't see how the latter verses could possibly come true, outside of Antiochus being reincarnated and attacking Egypt again. Certainly, there's nothing in the text that leads me to believe that that's what Daniel was trying to imply. 

> Regarding your mention of the passage where God spoke with Moses, here are one or two descriptions of how God's providence works in this kind of scenario.

Neither of those responses really seem to address the problem. The Ligonier site seems to just change the definition of ""changing [one's] mind"" to something else entirely and argue that what God did doesn't match that definition. However, a plain reading still seems to show that God was convinced to take a different course of action, which is where the tension lies. Regardless of the words used to express it, God's actions appear to be inconsistent with the behavior of an all-knowing divinity. 

The ToughQuestionsAnswered source just engages in some circular reasoning. The fact that God's mind was changed is what called God's omniscience into question. Appealing to God's omniscience to resolve this apparent conflict just assumes the conclusion. 

> I can understand desire to understand why Christians don't agree with you that ""God is a monster"" based on the excerpted passages from Numbers etc., and I can assure you that understanding the Bible fully can give a Christian perspective that God’s character is full of love and mercy and grace. Perhaps I could interest you in an atheist's critique of Dawkins' version of Christianity (I really enjoyed reading this), or a Christian's critique to help give you insight into the Christian perspective.

To be frank, I disagree with Dawkins on quite a bit. I've read a few of his books, and while he's a great biologist and a compelling orator, his philosophy is kinda... meh. He isn't as careful with his assertions or language as I'd like, and I feel like a lot of what he says regarding religion is intended to rile people up more than anything else. 

Instead, my criticism of these passages is based off my own reasoning. I'm fairly certain that there are no circumstances that would justify rape, slavery, or the mass murder of children. A plain reading of a number of passages in the OT has God condoning or even commanding these things. This leaves us with either a God that commands immoral acts and thus cannot be said to be moral, or with the fact that the slaughter, rape, and enslavement of prisoners of war and children is sometimes justified. The latter can be disproved with any sane definition of morality. 

> There are many books written on the Trinity, but I don't think you'd be interested in them at this time given your reply on that topic. :) I'd disagree that Lewis supported partialism, but I'm not looking for a debate on it.

That's fair. I'd love to hear you reasoning; if I'm wrong, I want to know about it. But I won't push the issue if that's not a conversation you want to have. 

> I appreciate your acknowledging that Qui-gon's perspective on the force is, in your words, ""unique"". That agrees with my point that Qui-gon's words were contradictory to Yoda's words in the OT (Original Trilogy).

Oh, no doubt Qui-Gon has a different understanding of the Force than Yoda. What I'm trying to convey is that their disagreement is just that rather than a plot hole; neither one is necessarily a reliable narrator. 

> You're correct that the Rogue One transmission was made to another ship, and the cartridge was physically carried to Tantiv IV. That Vader was trying to stop the cartridge from being physically transferred says, to me, that Vader's first priority would be finding the cartridge, and that his accusation should have been ""a cartridge was smuggled aboard this ship.""

I don't see much of a difference between Vader accusing Leia over a cartridge or a transmission. Both are more or less correct.

 > And I also agree Leia was clearly lying, but to me it doesn't follow that she would have even made up a story about a diplomatic mission, as clearly her ship was just in a giant space battle and couldn't possibly have been on a diplomatic mission...

The original Star Wars opened with a giant space battle. The Yavin IV was trading fire with the star destroyer long before the stormtroopers breached its doors. When I first really watched it, it seemed to me that Leia was making up the bit about the diplomatic mission in the same way people who just committed a crime in front of a police officer say ""I didn't do anything!"" She wasn't expecting anyone to believe her; she was just being a punk. 

> There’s not much for me to add to the R2/Chewy bit since you basically agreed with what I said, just are choosing to accept what, to me, is incredibly unlikely given the evidence.

">I agree, I was just using that as an example. When the whole ""bakery owner refuses to sell cake to gay couple"" story popped up a few years ago, people were rightly outraged, but supporters of the bakery owner piped up with arguments that the only other alternative would be to force that bakery owner to make the cake for that gay couple instead,

If you understand that it is absolutely a false dilemma self servingly created by people who wish to deny others the rights, responsibilities and privileges that they, themselves, demand and happily enjoy then why did you use it as an example? I understand that it is an easy illustration of the the hypothetical (you are speaking hypothetically correct?) you want to discuss. But if you know this than the discussion is kind of a non starter isn't it? We all know that ""the other side"" is full of shit, therefore the compromise you are attempting to create is kowtowing to their false arguments.

>I begrudgingly admit that people should maintain a right to discriminate as they so choose. I just think that when that discrimination intersects with the public in a certain way, it shouldn't be given automatic deference.

People can discriminate as they so choose. Outside of very extreme circumstances I would never seek to limit someones right to be needlessly and maliciously discriminatory. Honestly I have no idea how I or anyone else could prevent someone from acting discriminatory. The question is: Should we actively protect or encourage people who wish to actively deny the rights, responsibilities and privileges of other members of society while they themselves demand that those same rights, responsibilities and privileges? I believe that any sort of leeway, or accommodation to this toxic and self serving attitude is wrong. Even a system in which the bigots were allowed to opt out of subsidies or opt in to have greater taxes placed upon them so that they could discriminate is a system that is complicate in the toxic hypocrisy of their stance.

> I'm suggesting that once it does get to that point, it would seem prudent and fair to incentivize non-discrimination in such a way, since some people are effectively subsidizing a business they can't shop at.

We already do this with non-discrimination laws. What you are suggesting would actually be protecting, and enshrining people's bigoted hypocrisy by allowing them to discriminate and continue to enjoy living in a society based on non-discrimination.

>Also, while I understand your apprehension at how willing the population would be to accept this as a standard, I'm curious how you view similar acts - like the illegality of discrimination in workplaces.

It's not an apprehension, it's an obvious and predictable fact. Look at interviews with the bakery couple from a few years ago, look at Stacey Campfield:  http 

These people are convinced that they should not be held accountable, socially or legally, for their actions while they themselves hold other people accountable for nothing more than bigoted assumptions. There is a super slim possibility that someone out there has the intellectual honesty and perspective enough to understand and admit that if they desire the ability to needlessly and maliciously discriminate against others (based on assumptions) that the obvious and natural extension of that reasoning is that they are subject to consequences of their own actions. Such people do not often make their voices heard, and if they did so I still wouldn't believe them.

>could you make the claim that a person subsidizing a business they can't patronize is a clear, obvious problem, 

I edited some words out to clarify what I think you were trying to say. I hope that's not condescending and that I got it right.

That said: Yes, I do think that's a problem

>and would it be reasonable to say it should jeopardize any and all business-friendly subsidies they might otherwise receive?

I think it should jeopardize their very ability to continue operating the business altogether. People who expect society to treat them well should be expected to treat everyone else well too.

>Secondly, how are other instances of illegal discrimination monitored for compliance? Would the infrastructure be all that different?

I don't know exactly, but I believe that most of it is handled through civil law suits, audits and labor boards. I also believe that the infrastructure would be vastly different as you are know talking about tax subsidies, and enforcement which would require some sort of regular check up, as well as an appeals process, etc. etc.

> If a business owner didn't contribute at all to public infrastructure then I would agree, but if they are equally paying the road, and I'm not barred from using the road, then I'm not affected by their discrimination in the same way - or even at all, right?

I think you have it backwards? I'm not concerned with your ability to use roads. I'm concerned with people who wish to actively deny others the ability to participate in our society while enjoying the benefits of our society themselves.

It doesn't matter if the content is relevant to them or not. Almost any form of media you can name works better if it's aesthetically pleasing, and you can Google if you're looking for studies and research... they won't be hard to find because this has been a prominent issue over the past few years.

Some people have the circumstances/determination which allows them to completely commit to an approach (and well done to them), but also happen to be total assholes. They will be condescending assholes whether online or face-to-face.

Unfortunately, the assholes/hardliners are unlikely to change, but often there seem to be people in groups who tend to follow the group dynamic, but can be swayed to change their approach when more gentle/accepting/welcoming responses are modelled. (Eg, the 'hardliners' might attack a newcomer, but if the 'followers' witness a more balanced response, you often see them start to chime in... so long as the group environment isn't completely toxic.)

"> I think that the representation of women in gaming is a problem, both in terms of women in the actual games and female developers.

I see this parroted around a lot and I really don't see the problem. Women have always been there in this industry since the early days of the Atari 2600. They're still there making games that are enjoyed, and have plenty of fans. People appreciate them for their work, not their gender.

You're not hearing about them though because they don't walk around making a big deal about it. Simply put, there's a lot more women in this industry than just Wu and Quinn. And to be blunt, the reason those two are making such a big deal about it is because they know the quality of their work is not a strong foundation for them to stand on.

Same with representation in games themselves. We have a wide range of different characters all throughout games. It's almost impossible to not find one you can enjoy and relate to. Are there some sexualized female characters? Sure, just as there's sexualized male characters and non-sexualized female characters. 

I think the solution to this supposed problem is to simply come to terms with the fact that we all have different tastes. Instead of demanding gamers change their tastes, or demand that artists change their work to conform to some Politically Correct mindset, we should just let people enjoy what they want to enjoy.

There's plenty of room in this industry for everyone to find their own niche and enjoy it. There's no need to stand around and be patronizing and condescending to each other just because someone is repulsed by what another person likes."
"There are several points here to be addressed:

> isn't a big part of the problem that the police force in the US is lacking and needs to be larger?

The US is large. Actually it's very large, and there really aren't that many people here for how large it is. Unless you live in a well populated area, you can't ever really expect to have the 'luxury' of police always being near enough to respond in time to do you any good. Larger police forces aren't really a great solution to this problem because of how many you would need to cover that much territory, and how much it would cost local governments with few pennies to spare to fund them. Besides, with the direction that police forces in this country have taken in recent decades towards increased militarism, I'm not sure that I'd be comfortable giving those departments more resources to use to continue that trend.

> But as you say, most gun violence incorporates hand guns, and when it comes to self defense a hand gun makes more sense than a shotgun or AR, 

Actually, depending on the situation, a handgun isn't a great option for self defense at all. They are low powered (compared to long guns), and they are harder to aim. Their only real advantage is their portability and conceal-ability.

> so why should a citizen realistically own an AR? Even when it's limited to semi only and 5 round magazine, the weapon type just doesn't make any sense privately owned, but again, I'd love to own one myself because I like guns but understand why I can't.

I don't mean for this to be condescending, but I would guess that you aren't terribly familiar with the AR platform. The AR-15 is primarily different from your average hunting rifle in that it uses a smaller, less powerful round. Aside from that, the differences are generally cosmetic. In fact, for medium-small game, many hunters prefer to use AR-15s. The AR-15 is just scarier-looking; that's about it. Many hunting rifles are semi-automatic, and many of them use interchangeable magazines, so in that way they are similar to AR-15s. It is in no way more dangerous than a standard rifle; in fact it's smaller cartridge is actually less destructive than most hunting rifle ammunition.

Why should a private citizen own one? The question should be 'Why shouldn't a private citizen own one?' They are highly customizable rifles, ideal for hunting certain types of game, and they are decent for home defense because they have low recoil and are very easy to control. The only half-way coherent argument against them is that they can be used in mass shootings. The thing is, they aren't really used that way very often at all. Nearly all of the mass shootings in the last several years, and the vast majority of all firearm crime, have involved simple handguns, probably because they, unlike long guns like the AR-15, are easy to conceal."

She was trying to determine if you can eat a healthy diet on snap, not just subsist and eventually end up with scurvy. In the end, she determined that no, you cannot, and she owned up to the fact that her initial hypothesis (that you can) was incorrect.

"Now that I'm sober, there's just one thing that's bugging me.

You claimed that mathematicians wouldn't bother to publish a proof that 1 + 1 = 2. I immediately showed you a millenia-old published proof that 1 + 1 = 2.

I said math isn't science. You said it is, and then linked to a Wikipedia article that only shows that it is a heavily debated distinction. Science is built on math, which is built on logic, which is a branch of philosophy. The line where they are distinguishably different is hard to define, but in the case I was citing, it's not: mathematicians publish proofs, whereas scientists publish experimental data.

You keep saying that essentially you were correct about the original question about human eggs, but that's not my point.

You later went back and explained to /u/pettingzoocontest why you felt he/she was mistaken in more detail, but initially, he/she brought up a valid question and you arrogantly and curtly dismissed it.

Every time I've tried to explain this to you, you've continued to say unsupported, arrogant things. On the anonymous internet, unless you can provide sources or proof of authority, just saying something is a fact is rather dangerous. This is why, as someone above mentioned, many of us parrot that we ""only use 10% of our brains"" or other nonsense. It's actually rather important for people to defend against the spread of ignorance by insisting that publicly broadcast opinions are backed up with references of some kind. You seem to be glossing over this, as if my point doesn't matter — which is exactly what you originally did to /u/pettingzoocontest .

I'm not about ""teaching the controversy,"" and you're lumping me in with other people making claims I'm not when you use that politically charged phrase. You also made a comment about how difficult it is to speak with ""people like me"" when I made a comment that is quite reasonable and not controversial at all. What you're doing is straw-manning me, conflating my legitimate, referenced points with other people you've heard from before.

You're certainly right that some reactions are likely to be quicker than others at any temperature, but the number of reactions that run quickly must necessarily decline with temperature. Similarly, the number of reactions that go very quickly must necessarily increase with temperature. So it stands to reason that there's a sweet-spot where life has enough ""choice"", as it were, of quick reactions to mix with slow and stable reactions to enable the complex biochemistry that enables life.

>there might be an entire biosphere that has methane as their form of liquid (their form of aqueous solution),

This is relatively unlikely, because of methane's chemical properties...

>Water: the liquid compound that is used as a medium to all life we know. Otherwise, 270K is just as arbitrary a number as 90K or 500K.

See, no, that's my point -- it's not arbitrary. The Kelvin scale has a zero point, and is a measurement of heat energy. The lower the number, the less energy in the system. Too little energy and doing anything becomes difficult -- not impossible, maybe, but certainly difficult. And too much energy leads to the opposite problem: molecules are ripped apart much more easily, as the vibration of the molecules (due to heat) become strong enough to break covalent bonds.

>Everything is relative. The only real limit would be when the temperatures are so high that chemical bonds and reactions are no longer possible.

Kelvin is not a relative scale. That's the point."

The latter type tends to blame all of their problems on 'stupid people' and has a really hard time processing that sometimes nobody wants their opinion. As a woman, it is torture to date someone who thinks they are always right and that all of their interests are superior to yours.

This really strikes a chord with me. That was my experience as well.

It was all about their interests and hobbies. They wouldn’t go out of their way to show an active interest in mine. 

They all claimed they wanted a “smart, independent, ambitious woman” until I actually pursued my ambitions and then they expected my career to take a backseat to theirs. Every time.

First one in high school expected me to follow him to the university he wanted to go to (but of course the reverse was out of the question). College boyfriends expected me to find internships and career opportunities near theirs. Post-grad boyfriend didn’t want me moving for a better job offer. 

They tended to want to have the information flow only one way and a lot of discussions had a condescending, competitive undertone to them.

You're the one who questioned the original comment, so to me that implies you care somewhat about the subject itself. If you're referring to the fact that I replied to two of your comments, I can see how that came off to you as me ""caring"" more about trying to attack you, but honestly I don't usually look at usernames before I reply.

I originally took your demeanor as you being offended at the joke and flat out denying the premise behind it. If that's not the case and you truly were looking to open your mind to others feelings on the issue, than fine, I retract it, but I feel like I've done as much as I care to do to inform you at this point. I feel it's up to you now to figure out why a lot of other people disagree with you.

>And like the fifth exact conversation, if you want to call it that, like this I've had today.

If this really is the fifth time, can you maybe entertain the notion that it might actually have to do with something you are doing? Most people usually don't get into arguments with everyone (or at least five people) they talk to in a day.

>I take personal slights relatively seriously. 

I'm sorry but it irks me when people come into more lighthearted submissions and attack other people's off the cuff statements. They weren't asking for that. I feel if you want to be this confrontational, you should do in a context where people are expecting it. In my opinion this thread was not.

"> there is no possible way to know about anything infinitly

God has condescended to appeal to our understanding and reveal things about his divine and eternal nature. He has done this in his word (scripture), with the prophets and through the person of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He literally came down to us as a person in order to teach us about Him and our relationship with him. Moreover, he has created us in his image to know him so that we would understand things about him and created the universe (and the very fabric of reality) around us to reflect on his nature so that all men are without excuse. Finally, he gave us the Spirit, which Christ called the ""helper"" to work in our hearts so that we might understand and come to Him. 

That's not to say that we understand all things about God. But he has done everything necessary to reveal to us the things we need to know in order to have a relationship with him and to find joy in glorifying him--which is the purpose for which we were created. "
"I will try to take a more constructive tone in this reply.

I can see why my comment might come across as a strawman and a personal attack, but that's not what I was going for, which is why I said ""I can see you're trying to avoid"". I'm not claiming social movements are hive minds. I'm not claiming feminism is a hive mind. My above analysis of feminism in terms of its outcomes is one way to analyse it; I'm not saying it's the only way.

But it is important to analyse the overall effect that feminism has had on the world. Because, though we may disagree over whether feminism is dominant, surely you can't deny that feminism is by this point a very powerful movement which has influenced the world in all sorts of ways. I'm sure you're happy for feminism to take credit for positive outcomes that feminists have brought about; by the same standard, it follows that feminism must take the blame for negative outcomes that feminists have brought about.

> In the 19th Century?

It was a very early example of feminist activism. The point is that custody is an area where there used to be injustice against women, and feminism flipped it into injustice against men. Yet feminists describe each of these custody regimes as ""patriarchy"". Which means that two opposite norms are each being defined as ""patriarchy"". Now do you see my point?

There are other examples where feminism has reinforced male disadvantages. One of the big ones is the Duluth model, which sees domestic abuse as a male-on-female issue and claims that any female violence is probably in self-defence.

> In your other reply to my other post, you talked about Feminists interpreting anomalous data however they liked.

> The thing of it is, the primary issues of Feminism, social issues about the way people regard women, are not something that happens in the abstract.

> It is something that most women have very direct experience with.

The theories used to describe it do get very abstract. And the theory is based on only female experiences, largely ignoring male experiences unless they can be shoehorned into the theory created based on female experiences. (And the same treatment is given to any other evidence that potentially contradicts the conclusions drawn from female experiences.) That is what I mean by interpretation of anomalous data.

To bring up yet another analogy, consider the parable of the blind men and the elephant. Feminist theory is built on experiences of certain parts of the elephant more than others, and therefore its overall analysis of the elephant is (IMO) highly flawed.

> For what you say is Feminism's dominance

If feminism is not the dominant ideology, then why (and how) are critics of feminism so demonized and ostracized? The media constantly tries to associate MRAs with serial killers, rapists, Nazis, and trolls. And speaking from my own lived experience, the reaction I get when I criticize feminism is more hostile than when I express any other view. A major reason I'm arguing online about it (as well as being partly to clarify my own views) is because I'm afraid to talk about it face-to-face.

> Even Feminist politicians are publicly dismissed by anti-feminist politicians on the basis of their gender.

I think you'd probably find more instances of the opposite, what with the popularity of terms like ""mansplaining"".

Which of your points did I fail to respond to? Some points were addressed in the other replies I linked.

> You went from initially acknowledging Feminism to attacking it.

Are you saying I've contradicted myself? Where?

> You're just attacking Feminism to feel good about yourself, in a way that does not make a difference to men.

I am attacking a narrative that I believe harms men.

> Maybe take a look at rMensLib or something if you want to see what people organizing to transcend men's social issues looks like. 

I'm already banned from there. I think they are doing some good things, but I think they need to question more feminist assumptions, and it's an echo chamber as the moderators rule the place with an iron fist.

Also, I don't think rMensLib would have even come into existence if MRAs hadn't raised awareness of men's issues in the first place. Raising awareness is one thing that MRAs have achieved, though unfortunately the tactics used to do so have contributed to a very polarized political landscape which makes it difficult to resolve anything. You see, I can acknowledge some positive and negative outcomes that my own ideology has had on the world, despite it not being a monolith.

By the way, I used to be a feminist and I used to make the same argument against MRAs, that they should just join with feminists to fight the patriarchy. But I have come around to the opinion that it is not as simple and easy as that. What has to be fought is a set of social and cultural assumptions and expectations, we agree on that. But to just call all those things ""patriarchy"" builds a lot of assumptions into the very language that is being used, and those assumptions are in my view a barrier to both understanding and resolving the issues, particularly men's issues."
"> Like, what if I went swimming with you and pushed you into the pool. If I said the right words and told you that you were baptized now, would you be a Mormon? No.

Your analogy breaks down because, in this scenario, you're still pushing people into the pool. Whether or not they emerge changed is insignificant. A non-believer wouldn't care about who the LDS considers to be Mormon or not. But a non-believer can and does understand that unsolicited baptism is, at it's very least, a disrespectful and condescending practice.

And to say that we might appreciate it? That statement shows fundamental disregard for the beliefs of others. The reason I care is because, believe it or not, the practice absolutely does deny agency. It's bad theology too since you've re-stated Pascale's Wager.

"> Like when some poor teenage boy uses the word female and everyone jumps his case.

About this, here on Reddit I see way more women use ""female"" than men. Many women refer to themselves or other women as ""females"" and nobody bats an eye but as soon as a man does it, he's suddenly evil and sexist. Not to mention that I've never even once seen a woman object to a man being called male, only a woman being called female. If you object to ""female"", shouldn't you also object to ""male"" because otherwise it's kind of a double standard?

Also I always find it a bit strange when there' a thread called something like ""What should men know about periods?"" and most users offer helpful answers but some act really condescending and even make comments like how dumb and ignorant most men are about periods. But when you think about it, how are they suppsed to know everything we know about periods if they don't have them? They can either learn about it from their girlfriends or researching on the internet. I'm female and before discovering Reddit, I didn't know anything about other women's periods, only my own. I assumed that every woman had a similar period to my own and didn't know periods were actually so diverse. I don't think men are ""dumb"" for not knowing certain small details like how long can a tampon be kept inside before needing to be changed, how exactly women feel during period, etc. Especially if they never had a girlfriend. I remember one woman actually getting offended because a man didn't know what ""labia majora"" was. I'm 20 and I only learned it like half a year ago - on Reddit, not in school or anywhere else. And I probably can't name every part of penis in Latin either, or know in minor scientific detail how they work exactly."

"> Plus, why do Obama's words have to be taken in the worst way possible?

Because that's exactly how he meant them. This wasn't an isolated incident in his presidency, but the base line. Obama was the first president I can remember since Nixon singling out specific individual private american citizens, which he has done with Rush Limbaugh, and he also did durring the 2012 election when he singled out private citizen donors to the Romney campeign (the article is unfortunately behind a pay wall now, if you google the title and ""google cache"" you should be able to find it).

And its because those words were meant to energize his base about their rightness. They were to galvanize them into a political frenzy about the righteousness and rightness of their path. They aren't the ignorant ones, we need to prevent the ignorant ones from gaining power. Obama created the intransigence against him by being condescending and disrespectful to those who disagreed with him all while liberals oohed and ahhed about how presidential he was. And in the face of the resistance to his policy and using arguments like ""I Won"" as a way to push his policy liberals started blanket accusing Republicans of racism.

And your right about addressing racism, but that's been horribly botched too. Privledge theory is more about blaming white people for all problems facing minorities, and its just making the problem worse.

>It wouldn't be unheard of in liberal politics to acknowledge that a group has a problem but still deserves empathy.

This right here is the problem. The implicit assumptions by liberals that guns are religion are problems. The sheer arrogance in this kind of thinking is breathtaking. It demonstrates a level of ""I know best for you"" that is always terrifying in politics.

Also, it would be absolutely unheard of for liberals to do this when it acknowledges white people. And its still extremely rare. Were talking about the people who celebrated the death of Margaret Thatcher. Can you name a single liberal leader who conservatives celebrated the death of? 

This may have seen like a bit of a rant, and it was. It was because I'm fucking sick of the bullshit ""tolerance and inclusion"" from the left. If the left is going to pretend it has a monopoly and tolerance and empathy the way they have been for the last 20 years, perhaps they should start showing it."

For the sake of argument, isn't it? Is it a coincidence that Jews played a leading role in the 1965 Hart-Cellar Act which has devasted America's demographic and political unity and created our contemporary immigration mess? Is it a coincidence that a majority of the Bolshevik elite, who murdered at least 20,000,000 Russian Orthodox Christians, were all ethnically Jewish? Was it a coincidence that Jewish ""Atheists"" played a significant role in the 19th century's anarchist and socialist movements -- including the Assassination of Tsar Alexander II? How about the creation of Communism? Today's Anti-Semites observe how Israeli and Jewish groups are some of the fiercest advocates for Syrian Refugee programs... to America, and Europe. They note that ""liberal hollywood"" is factually dominated by Jews who almost universally support progressive politics in their films and TV. They note how many self-proclaimed ""secular"" progressive celebrities and social figures espousing radical ideology happened to have a Jewish Grandmother, or grew up in a Jewish but ""Non-religious"" household. And how curious that Jewish conservatives are so prominently represented in the ex-Trotskyite political movement we call Neo-Conservatism: the very warmongering political block Trump Supports fought to defeat this election. They even note that Jews play a leading role in modern SJW culture as well

 When people see a racist MTV-advert condescendingly telling ""White People"" what they need to do to proverbially ""check themselves"", and then they discover the guy in charge is a 400lb Jewish Guy who walks around in a suit that literally has ""Fuck White People"" written all over it, they start to believe the Anti-Semites might have a point - that Jews have a hatred of White people and support politics and cultural behavior that is damaging to them virtually whenever possible.

Unless a counter-narrative is developed anti-Semitism will likely become a dominant element in the Western Right-Wing. Progressive politics are like a Shibboleth to the Jewish community and this is rapidly making them targets.

Justin Martyr

>""[W]e have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do anyone harm and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution. And for this pollution a multitude of females and hermaphrodites, and those who commit unmentionable iniquities, are found in every nation. And you receive the hire of these, and duty and taxes from them, whom you ought to exterminate from your realm. And anyone who uses such persons, besides the godless and infamous and impure intercourse, may possibly be having intercourse with his own child, or relative, or brother. And there are some who prostitute even their own children and wives, and some are openly mutilated for the purpose of sodomy; and they refer these mysteries to the mother of the gods"" (First Apology 27 [A.D. 151]).

>LGBT+ Latinx people and LGBT+ people of color

If you are assuming that a Person of Color wrote the original post, you may be correct. The OP was being very respectful, and I applaud them for using the ""Latinx"" term, as it was coined in the Latin@ community online to refer to our queer sisters and brothers (and I believe it's not used for the ENTIRE community..). What you, and many others, don't seem to get is that this is a moment that LGBT+ individuals should be given the moment to speak their feelings out. This isn't to say that you, as an ally, shouldn't feel grieve, it's just that we want you to please give us space to speak FIRST. The only analogy that I can think of is if someone were to ask a black person what it's like to experience discrimination as a black person, yet a white person interferes and interrupts to speak for them (which is rude XD ) i.e whitesplaining. And if you view the video (which I HIGHLY recommend so you can understand my point), just replace the white, good meaning people with cis/straight allies, and the young black woman with the LGBT+ community. THAT'S what the OP means by asking cis/straight allies to please let LGBT+ individuals to express their sadness and frustration as to why they feel unsafe. 

And I'm sure there were cis/straight allies that night, but you need to understand that this nightclub was created and intended to be a safe space for LGBT+ individuals. This isn't to say that non-LGBT+ people aren't welcomed, of course they were/are, it's just that this space was NOT meant for them. And I'll get back to this later...

Now, to get to your kinda problematic statement ^_^'
>Has there been any evidence that the ~~African~~Black community was affected more than the any other race during this tragedy? I haven't seen any. So than[sic] why is this event only catered towards LBGT+, Latin, and people of color. ""Allies"" or white people aren't as welcomed as everyone else it seems. Because? Was there no white people killed at Pulse the other night? I haven't seen any evidence that a specific race was targeted.

You need to understand that black people aren't just the only group that fits in the POC community (And it's okay to say ""black community"" instead of ""African-American community"" Black people have been here as long as whites). Also, I think it's really troubling that you consider ""allies"" to ONLY be white people :/ There are cis/straight allies of Color as well. Lastly, there were 36 Latinx who were viciously murdered out of the 49 (and I do mean that ALL the victims were viciously murdered). Overall the majority were Latinx. And I would really like for you to pay attention to the media and see how many times they even point that out, and I'll also explain why THAT'S important.

There are people who find it difficult to believe that POC can be gay/transgender. That is why it's so important for us Latinxs for the media to emphasize that the majority of the victims were Latinxs. It's not a matter of ""pay attention to me,"" it's because our Latino community has been dehumanized for years and some folks can't seem to fathom that, hey!, our community has gay people too!

>The classic ... Don't forget about me!...We as a society need to work to make sure ALL voices are heard, and to make sure ALL lives matter. OF fucking COURSE Black Lives Matter, they matter a damn lot. ~~African~~ BLACK Americans have provided wonderful things for this country. Pushing one group down, to rise another up is not going to solve the worlds problems. We need to work together, and unite and welcome EVERYONE.

Okay, this isn't me trying to be condescending towards you, but this type of sentiment is what many POC and BLM supports find ignorant and annoying. The BLM movement is NOT trying to put anyone down to make themselves feel better. I found some great articles that I hope will help you understand why saying ""all lives matter"" is silly, ignorant, and doesn't solve anything ^_^' Again, the OP was trying to be respectful to the BLM movement, by not intruding in that space and creating another. Please read the articles, especially this one! and this one! The reddit user made an analogy that may change your perspective <3

Lastly, I want to get back to why this tragic event is important to the Latinx community. The majority of Latin American countries are Catholic. This means that being queer is seen as a sin/disgraceful. As was reported, 36 of the 49 victims were Latinx. You have people who can't believe that POC can be gay. This event reminds the Latinx community WHY we need to examine ourselves about the homophobia we have in our community. And it's not just us. I also hope that this helps GOP politicians/lawmakers realise that POC/LGBT+ can be victims of gun violence as well. It was just a couple of weeks ago that Christians lawmakers were using their ""religious beliefs"" to create laws to discriminate against LGBT+ individuals. It was recently that queer couples can LEGALLY marry! Mexico made it legal before us! Again, this isn't to say that you as a white person (which I am assuming you are from your tone), can't grieve for the victims because they were Latinx. What the LGBT+ community wants for the both of us is to listen. Let's give them our love, sympathy, empathy and our grieve, but let's sit back and listen to their experiences as an LGBT+ individual. 

For the record, I am a brown, bi Latinx ^_^ but even I know that this isn't the time for me to speak. I can only sympathize as I have not experienced discrimination for being bi (but have for being a WOC...ahaha...). I would absolutely love talk to you more about this if you have any questions <3 I'm so glad to see you being open for discussions. Thank you for your patience! <3"
"> I don't think I'm a sexist, misogynist pig.

Neither do they. But like others have said, sharing your viewpoint as a man is fine, just be mindful that it isn't coming across as if your being a man gives you a better or more unbiased perspective than that of a woman. There was a comment on TwoX a couple of weeks ago that literally started with ""Only seeing this because I wasn't logged in, but you need a man to explain to you what is going on here."" That's the sort of shit up with which no woman should ever have to put.

And a reminder to anyone who may be reading: Don't freak out if called out on your mansplaining. Everyone makes mistakes and if you genuinely listen to what you are being told and own up to it, you'll find that most people are quite nice and forgiving and willing to listen to you too.

"> And he was raised in a farming area in Kerela. 

Trust me. That state is as Christian as it gets. In fact Christianity reached Kerala's shores long before it even reached Europe. You might want to google ""Nasrani Christians"" or ""St.Thomas Christians"" . How do I know? I come from Tamil Nadu, the state that neighbors Kerala and I was born in a place that was once part of Kerala (but later transferred to Tamil Nadu). 25% of that state's population is Christian(my ex gf's mother is a Christian from Kerala). Another 26% is Muslim. 49% are Hindus(that's quite a low number considering, in the whole of India, Hindus make up 79% of the population). There's even a small Jewish community with a still functioning synagogue in that state. I don't mean to be condescending, but the ""argument from age"" reasoning doesn't work here because this state has always been proud of it's Christian identity (besides the Catholic state Goa) and everyone here knows it. 

In fact, any politician who runs for office in this state has to seek blessings from the various dioceses in Kerala if s/he wants to win. Even the godless communists pander to them.

"> Really? Please give me your definition.

I don't think ""Benevolent Sexism"" revolves around not liking women. If sexism can be considered ""Benevolent"" (though misguided, limiting, and condescending according to some feminists), I fail to see how sexism is characterized by not liking women.

>To the majority of Americans, when someone comes up and says ""you know, maybe giving women the right to vote wasn't such a good idea"" you get a shocked reaction if not a ""please tell me you're not serious"" reply.

Yes, because of illiberal political correctness.

Notice how you dismiss the idea without hearing a damn argument for it.

IRL, if someone came up to me and said, ""You know, maybe giving women the right to vote (or non-land-owning men, or whatever group of voters that were granted the right to vote later in the process) wasn't such a good idea"", I'd actually want to hear their thoughts, because I don't hear that kind of argument everyday, and I'm always interested in different thoughts and perspectives.

Nothing is beyond question or reproach in my mind. I may not agree fully with the argument presented, but I'm not horrified at the thought that someone doesn't see things exactly the way that I do or the way that the dominant societal narrative does. 

But then again, I consider myself actually liberal, as opposed to illiberal as most ""liberals"" present themselves these days.

>I don't think you realize how far outside the norm red pill is on these issues

Of course I realize how far outside the norm ideas like that are. That's why they are useful thought experiments.

"> All of the arguments against lying and stealing that you and others have put forth so far revolve around, ""What if you get caught?"" 

That's simply not true - at all. I have argued that it is harmful to you to do so - for your own self esteem, for what you will be able to accomplish in your life, directly and alone as well as indirectly and with others. If you have somehow read into any of my posts ""other people accept that lying is wrong without reason and therefore you should too"" you have been ignoring the actual content of my posts. Most other people don't in fact accept that lying is wrong. What I have said, most fundamentally, is that lying negates the mind and that the mind is your means of survival, so how you read into that ""what if you get caught?"" simply suggests you aren't reading at all.

Moreover when you say that you don't think that an action's practicality is objective it makes it clear that you're being sloppy (rather than not understanding). Eating food (an action) is objectively practical (it provides essential energy and nutrients). Breathing air (an action) is objectively practical (it provides the necessary oxygen for survival.) And so on. To call that absurd and in need of being proven shows just how sloppy your conceptual framework about survival is, and that you're not really ready to tread into the higher abstractions associated with morality from an objectivist perspective. 

I know the above paragraph may sound patronizing or condescending. It's not meant to be. But the kind of statements you are making really show that you aren't yourself concretizing the broad generalizations you're making - you're not thinking about how they apply at all, you're just asserting them. And equally badly, you accuse others, who have done the opposite - given you abstractions with concrete examples - of having made the mistake you are making. "

"> If you believe that markets react instantly or that it's ok to raise prices without determining the cause of a supply shift or demand shift first, then I don't know what to tell you.

You have an impending BA in Econ, yet you are applying such concepts to highly volatile markets such as collectibles? I mean this as condescending as it sounds, but you really should go back and discuss this with your professors. Magic cards (and other collectibles) are a very abnormal market - sorta like the stock market (futures) and sorta like a normal market. The normal part is the standard supply/demand of current products. The legacy product (secondary market, not the literal format) is like a futures market and an investment market all rolled into one. 

And the other counterpoint is that, yes, the net number of goods available for sale on the market fluctuates. There are a finite number of those cards printed, but not all of them are in circulation and therefore are not on the market. The price increase due to demand can then cause any number of new sellers or buyers to enter the market based on speculation. I, for example, have 5 or 6 Blood Moons just rotting away in a crate.

And while this tone of propaganda can be effective coming from an entity that is in a position of power over the target audience (like an occupying army, or a ruling political party, or your employer), this is a vastly different situation. If the narrative is true, that white people are in a position of power and oppress minorities, using this condescending, passive-aggressive tone against the very people that are supposedly in higher levels of power to order them to give up that power at once or else they are terrible people is very inappropriate and above all, ineffective.

Yes, tying the issue into STEM education may help, but it also seems a bit forced too :-/ Metrication is kind of a weird hybrid in a way, on the one hand, obscure and technical (not strictly speaking about metrication, but consider the ratio advantages of ISO paper like A4); on the other hand having all sorts of implications for daily lives. It's like we're bitten on the one hand by this being a don't-care issue for most people; and then we're bitten on the other hand by the fact that yes, there may be some initial inconvenience ahead (for everybody) even if we do manage to persuade (the right) people it's worth caring enough to do something about. And you know how short-term people tend to be…

I guess one tiny, tiny, ray of hope (and kind of grim one in a way), is the sort of passive language you hear from people about the issue. Those of us who've spent time in the US may have heard the ordinary American refrain that “oh yeah, they've been telling us since the 70s that we had to learn the metric system because we would switch to it, but it never happened”. It's a horrible thought, but there is a sort of good side to this passive attitude (treating it as an externally imposed thing that would or would not happen regardless of their personal opinion on the issue)… In a sense, it kind of reflects an understanding that this is a decision is not to be made on a popular level, that it comes from “Them”. Not sure if that makes sense… It's as though what is really needed is to convince the public that “They” think that finishing metrication once and for all is a good idea, and should that come to pass, the public will just (perhaps grumbling along the way) resign themselves to it. :-/

Maybe it's not all 'Murica Chest Thumping. In a way it feels like the battle, at least as far as the public sphere is concerned, isn't about pushing people into the pro-metric camp, but pushing people from don't-care-so-anti into don't-mind-so-not-particularly-against. It's a very subtle shift from one sort of neutral into another, from conservative-by-default into not-resisting-progress. We will never succeed at making it Cool to be Pro-Metric; the very best success we could hope for is making it something that a person, while not admitting to having an opinion on, would treat as a no-brainer-dunno-why-it-hasn't-already-happened when pressed on the matter. So maybe what needs to happen is to turn the conservatism thing on its head, and make it about momentum. If caring about metric is something that deserves a condescending smirk, maybe we can reframe it as going-the-the-flow vs. trying-to-hold-on-to-the-past.

It's why I suspect that dealing with metrication resisters is a waste of time. These people are almost equivalent to us (ineffectual nerds that care about an obscure technical issue)… the sole difference being that they happen to be wrong. We both have one strike against us (caring about silly things), but if you're going to care about a silly thing, at least be right about it. On the other hand, one thing in their favour is that they just get to coast along on default-conservatism, whereas we have an uphill struggle to fight against. In any case, they should be seen as a distraction more than anything else."

I was expecting some right wing lunatic, yet it was a well written summary that sought to meet ideas halfway. I've never seen something so taken out of context. Fair enough for Google to do it, they have an agenda - money. But the media had a duty to look at the facts.

Mischaracterisation and character assassinations (racists, sexists, homophobes etc.) are part of the mainstream now. The side of doing it has changed and the terms have changed. 

In the 50's it was a ""commie"" like we saw with ""Trumbo"". In the 70's it was a ""socialist"" or even ""liberal"". Now its the left calling anyone who criticises a group, idea, concept or even just talks about it, a racist, sexist etc. 

Yes the transgender issues etc. and all that gender stuff is a severe minority. But there is a large group that control the media, that firmly align with an ideology and anyone who waivers or criticises it will meet a shaming that can ruin a career or a life.

I have been here for plenty of years, probably far longer than yourself. I know the likes of Trump supporters here, they can be idiots. The internet is one thing, but the reality is another. How that snowflake conversation goes, is not the reality. The left do not make a coherent argument based on something intelligent. They moral high horse and don't confront any facts. I believe in Climate Change (man made etc), but Bill Nye on Tucker Carlson was a great example of this. He should lay out his facts, and not just repeat rhetoric. Though he is absolutely right. They have a habit of dismissing, ignoring and being very condescending. I firmly disagree with how that conversation plays out, because as of now, the left are the homogeneous power group who refuse to listen. 

I was in a bar with a bunch of girls from NYC (Im Irish) and I was literally in the middle of agreeing with them on Trump probably being impeached but I disagreed on when. Suddenly I was called a ""mansplainer"" and I was ""an apologist"" for his voters. It was irrelevant what reason or facts I used, they just attacked me personally. The Irish people with me started laughing at how silly they were being, which included Irish women. "

>goon mods in the top subreddits who have nuked entire comment sections.

Your mods have nuked threads, not that much different. 

>Quantity - quality.

Having people being able to say what they want with the least restrictions is the HIGHEST quality of free speech, regardless of how YOU feel the quality of the speech being said. In that case, places like Britain are superior to say....North Korea..... because of less restrictions. When discussing free speech QUANTITY must necessarily be a factor, the more people are allowed to speak the more free a place is. 

Which reminds me, why don't we discuss the QUALITY of the restrictions in place? A downvote or an unkind comment is not an absolute barrier to speech, a ban is. The quality of reciprocating speech of KiA's supposed brigade is much better than a mod banning people out of sight, and demanding a 500 word essay to be able to be heard again.

You still have speech, you still can reply. I've done nothing but express my disdain for you and/or your views. Your mod with his banning powers, and his ridiculous demands is STILL BY FAR the greater evil, in both quantity, and quality of his ""lalalalalalalaallaala"" skills.

I called him condescending, and I'd refer you to his interview (with I think Kim Hill) on Radio NZ this morning, or his ""not a massive fan"" interview from 3 months ago that I watched last Wednesday. In both cases he was ignoring the advice of his own ministers -as is his right- but when asked about it throwing out only complete waffle in defence of his ""captain's calls"". Those examples are just the ones I have encountered in the last week, but they are representative of his behaviour on almost any issue of gravity; for example when determining our military involvement in Iraq, instead of defending the morality of our involvement in the middle east, especially in light of the unjustified and disasterous invasion of Iraq and our complicity in human rights abuses in Afghanistan in service of US foreign policy, Key preferred to invoke petty insults and yell at anyone who disagreed with him to ""get some guts""."

"> Maybe its a regional thing, but I'm a little perplexed with how you seem to regard tradition as something ridiculous.

It's not.

It's not.

But acknowledging someone's grief is not the same thing as driving your car slowly. Some people may choose to acknowledge or show respect for someone's grief by driving their car slowly - and that's fine for them - but that doesn't mean everyone's has to do the same.

> This is tradition for the mourners' sake. I, personally, am willing to give 5 minutes of my day if it will make a day like this a bit more dignified for someone who has just gone through this much.

You know what? I actually agree with you. If it's a case of people voluntarily, of their own free will, uncoerced, choosing to not overtake a funeral procession on a highway - no problem. And if I was in a region where I knew beforehand that tradition was respected (even if I thought it was silly and mostly pointless, as I do) I might still go along with it - as you say, for five minutes.

But if the funeral procession is going significantly slower than the speed limit, then I guess the only way I could reasonably avoid overtaking it (without deliberately getting in the way of other traffic and causing congestion) would be to stay in the lane immediately behind it. And if I needed to exit the highway, then I'd need to get in an exit lane - and from that point the don't-overtake tradition can't apply, because I'd then be getting in the way of other traffic.

If a bunch of police (or fake pretending-to-be-police) then tried to stop me, and screamed abuse at me, and threatened to assault me... and then the real police involved flat-out refused to accept a perfectly legitimate complaint about this behaviour - and then the sheriff took the email of complaint I'd sent to him, along with his mocking, condescending, contemptuous, appeal-to-the-rabble response, and forwarded them both to the local paper (without my permission)... then I might feel a bit less inclined to ""voluntarily"" show ""respect"" in such a way in future."

Your premise is wrong: work is not a consensual contract, you are coerced by your livelihood. If I told you that you would lose your career if you didn't do what I instructed, that would be attempted coercion. You're threatening something valuable to me in order to get it.

"> As far as Theravada, one only needs to go to a wat full of families who have been Buddhist for generations to see that the modern, western idea of Theravadin Buddhism as ""pristine"" (there's no such thing) just doesn't hold up to reality.

This modern idea, which is indeed exceedingly common among Western converts, also has a lot of currency among modernist Asian Theravadins. (There are parallels among some Asian Chan/Zen adherents too.) Unfortunately this attitude tends to be more concentrated the higher up the social ladder we go, such that we have so-called ""educated"" or elite Asian Theravadins who speak quite condescendingly about those they call ""superstitious"", when in reality they know less about the tradition they claim to uphold. It's odd, because it requires a very selective and even careless reading of the suttas to uphold such a view.

But for those whose beliefs and practices are more deeply rooted in multi-generational traditions, however, you are absolutely right. Their Theravada looks nothing like Neo-Theravada.

"> Science can certainly tell us things about causality.

Science can only describe the effects of causality, not what causality is. Hume concluded that the best empiricism could do is describe occasionalism. We can say a billiard ball bumps into another, and then the other one bounces away. But you can only describe the before moment, and the after moment. You cannot say what causality is by any experiment. In fact, you are describing a theory that appeared in Aristotle's Physics, not his metaphysics. You're also describing Newtonian physics, not metaphysics. This is probably because most people don't think about metaphysics. And the metaphysics people think about today usually take the form of theoretical physics, even though the two are distinct fields. In fact, there have been a number of physicists that get grumpy that these fields have been blending. Feynman comes to mind, though this is more about him complaining about a specific metaphysical model.

Here's a short article on why its difficult if not impossible to nail down metaphysics in an empirical fashion. I actually suggest reading the whole thing for a quick introduction for what metaphysics actually is. Sorry I didn't post links before. I consider it pedantic and condescending assuming the person I'm debating with doesn't understand the concepts. Some shmuck I was debating with in another thread actually linked me, without any further elucidation, a wiki link for the burden of proof, in a thread where I raised the burden of proof myself. I didn't want to come off looking like a condescending shit.

But getting back to this thread. Atheism will require that it is at least possible that the universe is either uncaused, or caused itself. If you reject it, then you necessitate a non-physical cause, and are subject to Aristotle's proofs of the unmoved mover. The claim that is at least possible is a positive metaphysical claim. So is the claim that it's not possible the universe is causeless or causes itself. These are both metaphysical claims. The only person who doesn't make a positive metaphysical claim in this debate is the agnostic. If a person wants atheism to be a positive possibility, they're going to have to make a positive metaphysical claim. An agnostic may refute claims on either side, but he's not in the business of establishing possibilities. Quite the opposite in fact. Reddit isn't really used to real agnostics. Only /u/hammiesink comes to mind actually.

> I disagree, however, that this makes a positive claim. It merely debunks a positive claim made, and whatever positive claims replace it, have nothing to do with the definition of atheism.

You might want to actually give this one a try. I contend President Clinton was the first president. Refute this without making a positive claim that will ultimately need defending. I wouldn't say that it has anything to do with the definition of atheism, but I do contend that there are a number of positive claims that an atheist must commit themselves to if they want to refute any and all proofs for a deity. I provided one above. I'm going to soft ball another. The ontological argument contends (and this is really butchered, but I don't like the argument so I'm not doing any favors) that the greatest conceivable deity exists both in the mind and out of the mind, so it exists outside of the mind. An atheist, if they wish to refute this, must commit themselves to the positive belief that something being conceivable in the mind, and out of the mind, automatically confers actuality upon it. However, this is not a positive doctrine atheists must commit to if they want to keep the idea of atheism on the table. The second you back off that contention, you have to deal with the ontological argument all over again.

> As the OP pointed out, there exist super naturalists that are nevertheless atheists. Placing the source of ethical claims outside of nature does not make one a theist.

But they require a universal teleology. See my original post. I said divine command OR universal teleology. But atheists really don't want a universal teleology. Once you subscribe to a universal teleology, they must subscribe to final causation. Purposes imply creators. The Tao and Buddhism resemble Platonism in a lot of ways, and in these models, the deity itself is the universal teleology. While you're right that these don't resemble modern Christianity, and sure I'll grant you that, these models do in fact resemble classical theism, such as you'd see in Plotinus and even on the Peripatetic side like in Averroism. And remember, final causation is a type of causation. If you subscribe to a final causation, you agree to a supra-natural cause of the world, and you're going to find yourself out of atheism rather quickly."

there are between 500,000 and 3,000,000 defensive uses of guns per year.

there are between 30,000 and 35,000 gun related deaths per year.

even if we use the absolute extremes in your favor, 500,000 vs 35,000, and assume that every single gun death ever was 100% preventable by not owning guns, we can still find that you are 14 times more likely to need a gun in self defense than to die by it.

"> I honestly don't know how you're doing so well off with food. I do not find myself ever being well off enough with just jellyfish or seaweed.

Jellyfish respawn every 30 - 60 seconds, and surround nearly every island, in the shallow ocean directly around them. At any one time there's 10 - 15 around most islands, often more. Seaweed doesn't respawn as quickly but is plentiful. Limpets are all over the place, same with Crabbits, Eggs and Bananas are icing on the cake because you can farm them WHILE farming logs. Monster Meat is also extremely easy to obtain. I honestly don't know how you can struggle with food in Shipwrecked if you're experienced. I don't say that to condescend, it's just well-known that Shipwrecked essentially throws food at you. If you're having a problem with starvation it's because you're waiting too long to address food acquisition, not because of a lack of availability.

> And ive never had a shortage of resources when building walls. I build them to keep all ground items inside when its windy and I have no idea what else I'd be doing with all of the rocks I gather. 

Sandbags do the same thing, and prevent flood spread, and therefore you need them anyways. Walls are inefficient because they provide no defense and use up resources you could otherwise be using on more efficient craftables. I think you're just not seeing the damage hail does to your walls, if it hits a wall, it damages it, further wasting resources on repair. They just cost resources for no functional purpose. They don't provide defense, mobs just run around them, and the bosses destroy them. So they're basically just a resource sink, offering nothing in return. This is why we call them decorative.

> Also, how are farms a waste of time

Farms require too many resources and too much time to acquire those resources for very little return, especially in this context, when you should be focusing on the things needed for Hurricane season. 

It can take up to 3 days for some seeded foods to reach fruition barring rain whereas Jellyfish respawn every 30 - 60 seconds. The amount of time it takes to farm some food from the shallows near the island is not comparable to the time it takes to collect, create, and continually grow farms. Not to mention seeds and the need to be fertilized every so many uses, yet another resource and time sink. They're inefficient, just like walls, and unnecessary because you can achieve the same ends for far less cost and time. Also specializing a crop can take forever and generally requires a Bird Cage on top of that. It's a case of efficiency vs. inefficiency, and they're just not efficient.

EDIT: Forgot something.

1 Ice Maker 3000 and 1 Spider Den = Infinite Meatballs

">So really what's happening here is that personally, you have taste for more classical styles. Which is fine. But that's completely subjective.

You're being reductive, and I would expect more from someone with an architecture education. I enjoy modernism but this conversation isn't about style even though you keep trying to bring it back down to that. Buildings can be good or bad irrespective of their style.

Building quality is NOT ""completely subjective""--to say so devalues the work of architects. Good architecture is difficult to measure, but that doesn't mean that all buildings are simply a matter of being in the eyes of the beholder. Again, irrespective of style people can discern which building has more craft, interesting materiality, respects context, contributes to a sense of place, and which is more timeless (we're trying to be sustainable, right?). I said NOTHING about style.

>That kind of meaningless, over-the-top, sweeping categorical dismissal is the kind of thing that I'm arguing against here. It's completely asinine.

Have you already assumed that buildings must always be just as good or better than the ones that came before? The issues at hand are bigger than architects or styles--the climate for building doesn't foster the same quality of building as it did in the past when architecture was relatively hot new tech. Read the article.

It goes without saying that if someone really wants to kill another person, they will. There is not practical way to stop people from creating explosives, and they aren't used as often as guns in America anyway. Knives are a tool with a wide variety of useful applications and are extremely easy to put together, and have a fairly vague definition.

"> i will never cease to wonder why adults read them.

OK, I’ve jerked myself as raw as the next guy here, but this sub often swings too far in the other direction in the way some of you characterize the books that this website is obsessed with. The problem isn’t Harry Potter itself or the fact that people read the book as an adult. The problem is when they only read that, or when they only talk about books that have been discussed a million times. Adults read Harry Potter mainly because of nostalgia, but an adult reading it for the first time is doing so because it is clearly not just a kid’s series. This debate about those books has been happening endlessly since the condescending opinion pieces in the 1990s and early 2000s trying to degrade adults for reading a book meant for children. If you deny the fact that the story and themes do not merit an adult’s attention, you’re letting your frustration with the low-effort, lazy readers on this website affect you too much.

I recently had an experience with my girlfriend that made me realize how much this website can suck you into its own self-contained universe of ideas. We were walking through Barnes & Noble waiting for a movie to start, and we started looking through the shelves and talking about the books we like. My knee-jerk negative reaction to 1984 when she brought that up made absolutely no sense to her because she spends no time on reddit. I had developed such a deep sense of frustration at the fact that so many people exaggerate the significance of one book that I had elided that frustration with my opinion of the book itself. The same goes for the other books the kids on this website are obsessed with. The Count of Monte Cristo is not in itself a bad book. Very few of those books are. Even The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy has some good qualities (although it’s essentially Dickens-lite in terms of British humor in literature).

My point, at the risk of unjerking so hard that religions will worship my martyrdom in future generations, is that these books themselves aren’t the problem, nor is the fact that these people simply read them at all. It’s the fact that they read nothing else, that they exaggerate the significance of these books, and that they are incapable of thinking critically about literature at a level beyond the abilities of a seventh grader."

It's not ""Hey, being a manly man is cool, but if you don't want to be that, that's okay too"", it's more like ""Stop being so masculine and be more like a woman!"". You can't use phrases like ""toxic masculinity"" and ""mansplaining"" and expect that men take that well."

Literally the fact that gender roles vary from time and place. Makeup has been everything from masculine, to unisex, to feminine. Men and boys wore [dresses]( http  pink was once a boyish color. Long hair has been both manly and feminine. Women have been both land owners, and property. Children in some societies take their mother's name, and in others, their father's.

">So if you kill a person while he is sleeping, it doesn't constitute a crime because there was no pain felt? What does the perception of oneself have to do with being a human? An infant doesn't have a perception of oneself. What does the ability of feeling pain have to do with being human? Are anesthetized people not human? Are people without the ability to feel pain not human?

Killing a sleeping person is a crime because, even assuming he's not self-aware while asleep, he has been all his life. Anesthetized people are human. People without the ability to feel pain are human. In the immortal words of Jesse Eisenberg, ""did I adequately answer your condescending question?""

In order for killing a being to not be a crime, their death must be painless and they must either never have had self-awareness (like a fetus before week 30 or so) or have irrevocably lost it (persistent vegetative state patients), and in both cases it needs the consent of the people responsible. In the examples I used, those would be the parents and the nearest of kin, respectively. And I dismissed the painful killing of self-aware animals because there's usually a good reason for it (food, leather, w/e), and in any case, that's really not a big deal, as killing a trout isn't comparable to killing a human. All of this I stated elsewhere.

I'll rephrase. A fetus could be said to be a human person; however, I believe that perspective to be incorrect, in evidence of which I have written, honestly, far too much.

>Your argument isn't any better? Heartbeat vs ability to feel pain. Both are weak arguments.

Heartbeat is a ridiculous argument, as it's a physiological development like any other, with the distinction that it is neurologically regulated, albeit by literally the most primitive aspect of the brain. Ability to feel pain by itself wouldn't be a good argument either, or else giving people lethal injections in their sleep wouldn't be a a crime. But my argument is the combination of pain/self-awareness; I think it's a pretty decent one."

True, but it's one of these terms I find that was quite useful, but started to get misused almost immediately. Several times I've seen people use the term to mean any time a man is sitting with their legs apart, or for when a man's leg is slightly hanging into the aisle, but that's because they're giving the person on their other side space.

I find this happens with a lot of terms, like mansplaining. Should mean a man speaking over and/or dismissing a woman in a condescending manner, but I've often seen it used to just dismiss a man's opinion on anything, even if they're being respectful of other's opinions, or arguing against genuine ignorance/bigotry.

Right... Well, I already went to college. I already talked to these people, and have a general feel of what most people on my campus think, and based on that experience I find your claim inaccurate, but then again that's just one college.

>> Some of these references are included on the individual episode's Memory Alpha page, but many are not, and either way I'm wondering if we could compile a more easily accessible master list 

There's nothing in your post about being devising ""fan theories"", being creative, and inventing references. It seemed to me to be worded very clearly towards finding actual references between episodes and stories. I therefore misunderstood your intention.

If your intention was merely for people to invent connections between episodes and other stories, then I have no problems with it. Invent away!

Unfortunately, it seems to be turning that way. 

In the mid-2000s, if you were even half-decent with computers, you could find a job where you picked your own projects and never dealt with status pings. You were expected to show progress on something, but you could do it on your own terms. Programming was more like an R&D job than today's ticket-shop nonsense. The jobs where you were managed down to weeks and days were for incompetents who didn't really belong. You might even have an office– probably a shared office, but at least you weren't in an open-plan space that smells like feet.

> The ""product manager"" (another guy) would do this thing several times a day, where he come over behind my desk, places his hand firmly on my shoulder, and ask ""how is it going?"".

Ugh. The condescending hand on the shoulder makes it the worst. It's a power move. People just shouldn't touch each other at work. I would at least tell him to stop touching me (and pursue legal action if he kept doing it).

Product managers are another dystopian element of technology that, as it became more standard, convinced me that this industry was winding down, at least from a high-talent perspective. Executives (MBAs, mostly) have such a low opinion of their ex-engineer middle management that they've had to build a parallel management structure.

Your bosses probably hate PMs as much as you do. Even though the people manager has more power on paper, and product managers are generally disliked by everyone, they still get promoted faster. It ends up turning into a male-work/female-work split where the PM gets the male work (""delivering"" to executards what they want) and the people manager gets the female work (resolving conflicts, handling issues no one wants to deal with) and so it's not surprising that the PMs move up faster.

"I feel your response to this article is intellectually dishonest, and likely not intentionally so, and that warrants a rebuttal.

> Who are the people who have this incredible objection to kid's movies where the protagonist achieves their dream against all odds? Do they have any kids I wonder? Do they remember being a kid in either case? I don't recall the Karate Kid living the rest of his life with a breathing tube, the Goonies didn't starve to death in that cave, Snow White didn't die alone in the woods, the Fox didn't get torn to pieces by the Hound. Etc.

The point this article's author is making isn't that it's bad to pursue your dreams against the odds; the point is that it's bad to pursue your dreams without either putting in the work and sacrifice necessary to get to them, without being able to roll with the punches that will almost inevitably come up when you're pursuing something, or without realizing exactly what your limitations are as a person. It's not cynicism, it's criticism of these films which offer characters who make no real effort at obtaining their dreams -- their dreams are handed to them by circumstance or because they're just innately good without having to train for what they want. Basically it's about instant gratification -- instead of cultivating the patience and willpower necessary to become really good at something you enjoy or love, you're encouraging the attitude that these things should be immediately available to those who seek them. And that sets children up for frustration and failure and for discouragement: if they don't get what they anticipated the first time, they may just give up entirely because what they've learned doesn't teach them perseverance. That's the point of using ""A Boy Named Charlie Brown"" as a counterexample: it's not that we should be crushing kids' dreams, it's that we need not inflate their conception of what it is they're actually capable of. We can encourage kids to pursue what they love, but we shouldn't be dishonest as to what it is they're capable of obtaining or what it is they have to put into getting what they want. That's what Charlie Brown learns: even though he often bumbles or fails, Linus teaches him that it's better to keep going and try again, that the world doesn't end just because you've failed.

> You don't even have to be a parent to know that eliminating (all) movies where the ""hero"" wins would make things pretty damn depressing. Take up your pitchforks against those parents who substitute movies as interaction with their kids and don't validate (when appropriate and deserved of course) their children themselves.

This is a pretty binary idea of what kinds of films we can produce for children. So if it's not about how you can accomplish what could possibly be the impossible, it's going to be a mope-fest to destroy the innocence of children? That's pretty damn false a notion, and I don't see why we can't produce more measured, less condescending films for kids that can encourage them to take action and grow as individuals without deluding them as to what it will take to do just that."

Not an issue with me, I am able to keep my faith separate from science. I believe in evolution too, and that the earth is 4.5 billion years old.

>You do not understand what an inducible dipole is.

Yes I do, I have a degree in Physics, my first job was working with things that go boom. I have the fucking Table of Isotopes from LBL sitting on my desk. Not that that makes me a climate scientist, but I have written my share of simulations, including large natural system simulations, Yes I know my way around Fortran. I passed my AP chemistry test when I was 17.

>Those vibrational frequencies are specific. They are not broad range as in water. Thus they are less efficient in absorbing the Sun's spectra than water.

Still, CO2 is a significant IR absorber, not as much as H2O. It is considered to be responsible for 10 to 25% of the greenhouse effect. Do you dispute this number? Are you saying CO2 does not absorb IR? 

>The amount of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere is about 1/2%. It has changed little by our hand. 

Wrong, current CO2 concentration is apx. 385 ppm, this is less than 0.05%, not 1/2%. CO2 concentration is up over 100ppm, more than 35% from pre-industrial levels (280 ppb), Methane and Nitrous Oxide has increased even more, more than doubled.

>The molecular mechanism that you seem to infer for global warming but do not state is the heating of water by collision transfer. Look it up

Don't need to look it up, I've done the calculations myself, ages ago, and verified them. The problem is H2O is stable, but CO2 (and other greenhouse gases are not).

>Over the last century human's contribution to it is less than 50 parts per million. That is an insignificant change and absolute not enough to have an impact

Again wrong. CO2 was at 300 ppm in 1910. A 28 percent increase is not insignificant, and increased CO2 is having an impact; that's what all of the climate models indicate, and observations have verified. Levels of CO2 are higher than they have been for 2 million years.

>Read the computer simulation papers. They clearly state the problems with predicting the direction of the earth's temperature as a result of the interplay between the cooling effect of the melted ice and the clouds.

I have, they all reach the same overall conclusion; all models show increases in temperature, though the details differ. Show me one peer reviewed simulation from the last five years that shows increasing CO2 causes a decrease in temperature; there may be one or two (funded by oil companies) but the thousands of researchers have shown otherwise.

Do you think that telling your opposition that they oppose basic human rights is going to convince them to see things from your point of view? Nobody on either side of this debate sets out to oppose human rights. It's a matter of determining which right is more important, a baby's right to live or a woman's right to her body. That's the whole reason this debate exists. 

This isn't as simple as one side opposing human rights and the other being right. Pro-choicers arbitrarily claim that life begins at birth. When asked how a baby differs at birth to say one hour before birth pro-choicers will admit that the difference probably isn't huge. So they're admitting that there is no definitive line that dictates whether a baby is alive or not, if one could find such a line they would have to justify why the baby is more alive at that moment than it was an hour ago. 

 So it isn't as simple as condescending reddit pro-choicers like to think it is. If I was unsure whether someone was alive or not(which you always will be when it comes to babies in the womb) it wouldn't be moral for me to kill it, especially when I had a guarantee that that person would survive. It's undoubtedly more moral not to abort your baby(excluding obvious exceptions such as when the baby or yourself would be damaged in any way or rape), especially considering a baby can be given up for adoption(as I was).

I mean, still an objectively impressive feat. POTUS is an exclusive club.

Also, have you ever met Donald Trump in real life? I have. Legitimately a pretty cool guy. I didn't get a condescending vibe from him at all. Talked to my boyfriend and I for probably 5 or so minutes, and gave us quick advice about stuff to see and do in NY. 

Edit: In case you're wondering what his advice included, from what I can remember:

- We were already staying in one of the greatest hotels in the world, so not to worry about that.

- Big believer in seeing Central Park. Recommends taking the time to walk around over the horse and carriage tours.

- We mentioned we liked French food. He recommended Jean-Georges. Which, I know. Yeah, happens to be in one of his buildings. Still, zero complaints about the food or service itself.

- He really loves architecture, which isn't that surprising given his line of work. He didn't offer advice on any particular tour, but assured us that NY had some of the most beautiful buildings in the world and that we'd have a great time going around and seeing them. We, in fact, did. Brownstones rock my socks.

None of this speaks to whether or not he would be a good president. Also, it's a small sample size of interactions with Trump. Maybe we caught him on a good day? Who knows. I'm just saying that in our experience, when the cameras aren't rolling, he seemed like an alright guy.

">I guess. Seems like semantics to me though, man. I understand your point, but I don't think the ""answer"" I gave (about symmetry) brings any additional enlightenment to the person who asked the question, it just puts more steps in between the assumptions/observations and the result, and makes it harder for them to follow. 

The statements, ""physics can't answer that question"" and ""the answer is probably too complex for you to understand without a lot of study"" are not even remotely the same thing. You're right that a correct scientific answer is often not helpful to someone who doesn't have the background to understand it, but that doesn't mean the answer isn't there. It certainly is semantics, but I think the first statement creates a misconception about the limits of current scientific knowledge. The second statement can sound condescending if you're a jerk about it, but as long as the explainer cares that the asker is just trying to learn, and the asker recognizes that some things have no simple answers, I don't really see any downside. And, just as you did, if they really want to hear the answer anyway, we can provide it - and they can see for themselves whether it means anything to them or not. Maybe the answer will raise more questions for them, and maybe the process will lead to learning, or curiosity!

>Edit: I would submit that some ""why?"" questions can be rephrased as ""how?"" questions and thus answered by way of physics ... but then were they really ""why?"" questions in the first place?

Can you provide a ""why"" question that can be satisfactorily answered according to your standard in any context, without assumptions? Under what circumstances is a ""why"" question really a ""why"" question, and when is it a ""how"" question? We're back to semantics. 

The ""why"" questions that science cannot answer are questions about purpose. But such questions can be phrased less ambiguously as ""what"" questions, instead... For example, the common question, ""Why am I here?"" can be rephrased as ""What is my purpose?"" The first question could mean multiple things - it could be asking what led to my current state, or my existence at all (in which case I can actually start to answer that question), or it could be asking about my purpose in being here, in which case science and empiricism have nothing to say. 

Bringing it back to the original question, if the OP is asking, ""to what end does the photon have no mass?"", then physics has nothing to say on the matter, because science doesn't confer purpose, it simply describes. On the other hand, if the OP instead means, ""what causes the photon to be massless?"" we can start to answer that question just fine. The interrogative adverbs of the english language are far too ambiguous to set one on a pedestal; any question I can think of (although there might be exceptions) could be asked in many ways using different words. The correct meaning of the terrible cliche ""science can't answer why"" is all about purpose, not semantics. If ""why"" is being used to infer purpose, then that question can't be answered; but plenty of ""why"" questions do not have that meaning! In the end, though, it seems to me like you inferred the the OP wasn't asking about purpose, because the answer you eventually gave was the descriptive one, and in that case the adage really doesn't apply!"
"> Well, the thing here is that it's not always just a polite ""Oh but I disagree"" - it's more like, people of colour being mistreated or murdered under no pretense but prejudice. It's women being raped, and being shamed for it afterward. You have to remember that when people are standing up and causing a fuss, it's not over trivial things. It's not about getting a ticket for being an ass in a Toronto subway - this example kinda falls short of the gravity at which these matters are being discussed.

You're talking as if this were the Deep South of the 30s and there was a weekly lynching, or that you had rape gangs going around raping women and society would then punish the women. That's just ridiculous. That's the kind of hyperbole that's not at all helpful. And the idea that people don't protest about trivial things... we're in the era of ""microaggressions"", ""mansplaining"" and ""manspreading"". A ton of stuff activists push for IS trivial.

>Well then, consider that for some people, many people, this is not yet the case.

Not really, no. Even the cases you bring up tend to have it better than maybe 80% of the world's population. They may not be at the level we wish they were at and below the average, but the Canadian average is already extremely high compared to all societies in history.

>That, right there, at the very least is what people want recognition for - and to not glaze over the problem and pretend everything is fine, when it IS fine for some (coincidentally, generally white folk) but not all.

Fine for SOME, generally white, people? That's an absurd statement. It's more than fine for the vast majority of people. There's a theory that says that the better and more just a society becomes, the more intolerant people become to the slightest perceived injustice, so that in fact activists start screaming louder and louder as the actual issues they're dealing with becomes more and more trivial. The utter hyperbole of your statements is a good example of that.

Again, you have more than 200 000 people ""of color"" coming into Canada EACH YEAR. Almost none of them go back where they came from because things are ""not fine enough"" here.

>Finally, I just want to ask : why do you resist the idea that things can be better? Why do you resist the thought that through discussion, honesty, and openness about the challenges people face, that people's attitudes might shift into something that's more peaceful? Is that not what it took to get to where we are now? Why stop now when there is still so much to move through and accomplish?

Why do you never consider the possibility that, even with the best intentions, reforms to do better can in fact make things worse? Activists keep pushing divisive identity politics that fuel resentment and hatred, read what the woman of the student union wrote, how every sentence of hers about ""white"" Canadians drips with contempt or even outright hatred. Give the power to someone like that, and you don't get a better society, you get a much worse one, one tearing at the seams.

Maybe the difference is that you consider all the gains of the past to have been acquired permanently, they will never go away, so at worst, reform doesn't make things worse and can only make things better, so you're all gung-ho on them, because you think things can only get better. Whereas other people see successful societies as a precarious and careful exercise in balancing a lot of different factors and principles, and think that pushing things hard is far more likely to knock things out of balance than to make them better."
"> Maybe we have difference definitions of anti-male

Consider the sort of things feminists say about men. For example: ""Men need to be taught not to rape""

Imagine someone saying something like that about black people. It would be called hate speech and the person making such comments would be shunned by society, probably losing their job.

Feminists constantly make generalisations about men based on an infinitesimal minority. Just look at the feminist rhetoric which surrounded Elliot Rodger.

Feminists argued that all men were potential Elliot Rodgers. That we all feel entitled to women's bodies and are just one rejection away from exploding in violent rage.

Feminists also insist that men take a subordinate role in the movement. They want men involved but not as leaders, as foot soldiers. They shame men who attempt to have any input with terms like ""male privilege"" and ""mansplaining""

Finally, they have actively fought attempts to address men's issues. They misrepresent the MRM as a movement which wants to push gender roles back to the 1950s. They have opposed the protection of male victims of domestic violence. They have protested and made threats against public men's-rights meetings.

Does that fit your definition of anti-male?

> When I hear anti-male,I think ""down with men/oppress men"" and while modern feminism has adopted such views,non modern feminism hasn't (i mean the sufferages)

Well we aren't talking about historical feminism. We are talking about current feminism. It's feminism which brings up ""historic oppression"" in order to justify continuing a fight which has long since been won. The past is something to be learned from but in terms of issues to be addressed, the MRM is interested in the present, the issues men face now.

Women have all of the legal rights men have and more. The suffragette movement is done.

However, even back then, the movement was completely blind to the fact that men were also fucked over by their enforced gender roles, in many ways worse than simply being unable to vote. I'd say being sent to kill and die against your will ranks somewhere worse than lacking an infinitesimal influence in choosing which arsehole gets to run the country."

Because unlike Snoke, the Emperor isn't screwing up the status quo! How is this not obvious? The Emperor existed in a vacuum setting.

Obi-wan developed and matured during The Clone Wars and saw the fall of the Jedi. It's not at all weird for him to hold a particularly militaristic view of the Jedi religion. It's also not particularly un-Jedi like; Luke throwing his saber at the end of ROTJ is symbolic of him throwing away his life in defiance of the Emperor.

> Forcing kids into a philosophy they cannot possibly comprehend.

So who could possibly comprehend the Force? Aren't there secrets that even Yoda never managed to figure out in 900 years of life? If young children are naturally blessed with manifestations of the Force regardless of their understanding, isn't it for the safety of the child and their community for the Jedi to provide a framework of understanding? What else can they do, quarantine them? Real life religions cannot be possibly comprehended by kids, but Churches/Mosques/Temples still accept children as disciples?

The problem with Anakin/the other kids wasn't trying to teach him the Jedi philosophy at too young an age, the problem was the philosophy itself wasn't right for him or for most humans.

> Getting involved politically in general seems pretty un-Jedi.

The Jedi are guardians of peace. There is no reality where guarding the peace means being separate from politics.

> He was trying to resurrect a dead religion using almost entirely second hand information and tall tales.

So Luke knows how to be a Jedi himself, but he perverts his own beliefs to those of the PT Jedi since he doesn't know how to teach? That's what his failure boils down to, an inherent inability to teach properly?

He's not perfect. If you don't know the EU, maybe that's not a criticism you want to make.

This is perhaps the most frustrating part of this subject for Chelsea fans. Again, we're all more than aware of where the money comes from that ultimately brings the club so much success. But what should be do? Should we not enjoy the success Roman has brought the club? Should every trophy won come with an apology from the supporters? The condescending attitude on this subject from other fans is utterly disgusting, not to mention blindingly hypocritical. It's easy for someone to say, ""well if it were my club I couldn't support dirty money injected into the club to bring trophies.""

Now you are saying
>I don't see how anything you said runs counter to what I said. China has an aversion to taking on risk and consuming from a combination of government and individual level factors.

It is not necessarily that there is a contradiction as much as that the way you are making your argument is reductive at best. That is to say, your argument is wrong because it is not an argument. An argument has an assertion, logic backing the reason, and draws on evidence of some sort to demonstrate why that line of reasoning is relevant to the claim.

In this context the topic we are discussing stems from the comment by /u/knowshun regarding whether Chinese investment is too high or too low. We both seem to assert that it is too low. 

You give an assertion (savings in China is too high) with a reason (people are afraid to invest) and that does not logically link to your evidence (cultural factors hold people and government alike back); The logic you are working with is incorrect as it presupposes that individuals' desire to invest is relevant which it is not given that the state run banks control the economy.

I give an assertion (Savings in China is too high) with a reason (people are afraid to invest) which does link to my evidence (they do not spend money because they need to save it in case they have an accident). This is easily relatable and demonstrably true.

Chinese investment is low due to cultural proclivities to the same extent that amounts of loans made in the Middle East are low due to prohibitions on interest collection; that is to say, this is not the reason. Economic reasons drive the way people make decisions. You are doubly wrong in that you lump the motivations of people and governments together when those two groups of persons have entirely different motivations and so you simply can’t make this generalization. Full stop. 

Not trying to be condescending, this is a very widespread issue at virtually every level to the point of it being maddening.

Hitler didn't like Democracy because it was an individualist system that must by definition give rights to minorities. He believes that minorities didn't deserve things like human rights, and that even Germans only deserved human rights if they didn't betray him.

This is how I know you haven't thought this through. And I don't mean that in a condescending or arrogant way. I don't think you're stupid. I actually think you give Hitler way more moral credit than he deserves though.

Hitler was not wrong, he was evil, and you confuse the two at your own peril. When Hitler critiqued Democracy and espoused his views on race and human rights, he was making a very particular kind of argument. He was making a moral argument, a normative moral judgment.

Let's refresh ourselves on your definition of extremism.

>In my opinion, extremists are those who believe things that are completely disconnected from evidence for irrational reasons and are prepared to allow or make people suffer because of those beliefs.

Lack of evidence and irrationality. You are making a Newtonian argument, a materialist argument. Hitler was making phenomenological arguments. To use an analogy, you're saying 1+1=2, and anyone that disagrees is an extremist. Hitler was not denying the truth of 1+1=2 though, he was saying that 2 fills him with disgust and he wants to burn anyone that says 1+1=2.

You can't beat Hitler in a debate. In a 1 on 1 debate he would smoke you. Hitler was not an extremist as you define him; he was pure evil. Hitler was not motivated by irrational beliefs or by faulty evidence. You couldn't simply point out the facts to him and sway him from his course. Hitler was motivated by moral disgust for other people. That's a hell of a scary thing to someone that doesn't believe in good and evil, but it's true.

They undoubtedly need to get tested as well, but the benchmarks for i7 8700k are just as important as benchmarks for the near decade-old i7-920 (the oldest confirmed architecture to be affected that I know of) because both of them use speculative execution (in terms of the Meltdown exploit) in almost exactly the same way. Therefore, it is idiotic and misleading to somehow claim that benchmarks for older CPUs are somehow more important than ones for the newest. As they are all attacked the same because the part that is being attacked operates the same across the board."

I suppose the difference is that Sam doesn't also have a fifteen year-old niece as an option. And don't pull the ""Only a small portion of anime..."" card. There's a little-sister/young-forbidden-fruit character is about two-thirds of all seinen anime.

But the problem isn't really jailbait. That's just of symptom of, well... it's complicated.

I think people falsely ascribe the offense Westerners take at Otaku media to ""sexualization"". That's crazy, because Western media sexualizes women too. The real objection comes from a difference in sexual politics.

Imagine society's ideals for female sexuality as a spectrum between (A) innocent, passive, receiving, virginal, 'cute' and (B) liberated, proactive, suggestive, lustful, 'sexy'.

The West has undergone two waves of feminism. We ascribe the correct female sexual ideal as (B). Women are perceived as being equivalent to males in the sexual realm; they are not expected or even hoped to be virgins when entering a relationship. The word 'cute' is used less and less, 'hot' being the more popular adjective. The entire symbolism of marriage—where a father hands over his white-clad daughter to a husband, like a child changing custody—has become increasingly anachronistic.

Of course, the mental transition is not just sexual. As an amusing exhibit, here is a compilation of 50s advertisements where men condescend their wives over coffee. This sort of relationship dynamic pervades 50s media. The female's role was to be precious but incompetent. America has changed in this respect.

""Precious but incompetent"" pretty accurately describes Japan's sexual politics towards the feminine. Japan leans (A) hard. I once read a wonderful early 2000s blog about an American woman's experiences living in Japan (TOMT). The Japanese lovers she took were shocked when she tried to take an active role in sex—the unwritten norm being that women passively receive it. She wrote about thirty-year-old women bringing Hello Kitty lunchboxes to work and speaking ""cutesy"" to seem younger and more virginal. In Japanese media, women ubiquitously blush and get flustered with regards to romance. Women frequently yell 「いや!」 (""no, no"") during sex—consensual sex, mind you—to keep up an act of being inexperienced.

Jailbait is a symptom of the real problem Westerners have with anime. Anime implicitly portrays women as the passive, inexperienced, incompetent gender. In this system of sexual politics, fifteen-year-old girls—or the 'concept' of fifteen-year-old girls—form a kind of sexual ideal.

........ Fifteen-year-old girls form a kind of sexual ideal. Wow. That's a sentence I hope no one quotes me on.

Obviously I'm painting very broad strokes, and no anime-watchers will struggle to produce counterexamples. Nevertheless, I think if they're honest with themselves, they'll see that anime generally sexualizes women by showing their virginal charm. Rarely is the female lead of anime world-wise or sexually-liberated. Westerners would accept that much more readily. But unfortunately, dojikko and emotionally stunted -deres are 300x more common.

There's the problem. Not the balloon sized boobs. Not the harems. Not even the jailbait. It's the way Japanese media portrays women, comprehensively, as sexually subordinate.

Japanese vs. Otaku culture: I know that Otaku subcultures are not synonymous with mainstream Japanese culture.

Given that I asked for examples of ""Sam being put in his place which he needed to"", I thought not.

It implies being egregiously, offensively, stupidly wrong and being vigorously, obviously and indisputably corrected on your wrong ways. As a consequence that to me implies exact wording should be totally unnecessary. You'd put in his place someone like Trump, or a clownish Fox host, iow people who spout obvious, offensive bs, but definitely not a figure like Sam.

"> but I do feel as if there's a kind of unspoken bias against newer games and characters besides Echoes

There absolutely is. I think people don't notice as much because the haters here tend to stick to being condescending and rude so they don't cross the line into being overtly hostile like they are on youtube.

To be fair, it's not a huge problem like it can be other places, but the amount of otherwise reasonable people here who deny hate for new fans exists at all is baffling. (Have they ever seen the threads here about r/FireEmblemHeroes ?)"
">I'm a white dude [...] Why on earth does she still have a lead with minorities???

It's a reason white dudes are probably never going to viscerally understand. Politicians (especially white politicians) have been using African Americans as a political football for over a century, to the point where the community overall is extremely distrustful of politicians, especially white politicians, promising them anything. Words are wind, and actually being there counts. 

This sub is on a 'the Clintons were actually terrible for black people' rampage right now, but out in the real world most in the African American community know the Clintons well as lifelong effective advocates for their communities. They earned their trust, and whether or not folks on this sub believe it was well-placed is beside the point. 

Bernie Sanders just doesn't have enough time to build up that same amount of trust. It's not about 'saying all the right things', empty promises have been made to the community countless times before. Telling a black voter they are stupid for trusting a white politician on their word alone comes across as grossly condescending and tone-deaf when that word has been broken so frequently in the past by other seemingly well-meaning white politicians. "
">In other words, we don't know. Therefore speculation.

We do know, just not with 100% certainty. Not much really can be said with 100% certainty, which is the beauty of science and the scientific method. The way it works, is you observe all the evidence around you, and decide a theory that explains all of this evidence and what's happening. This may not be correct, however as far as you can see, and as far as you can deduce given the evidence, it is correct. The key here is to be critical and open to being incorrect. When new evidence is observed, it must be compared to the current theory, and the theory adjusted to include the new evidence (see geocentric vs heliocentric models of the universe).

Have you studied any neuroscience, or introduction level psychology? ^(edit: i don't mean this to be condescending, if that's how this comes across.) We have shown mental activity being linked with brain activity. The brain doesn't magically spawn consciousness, there's nothing magic about it. Consciousness is a product of brain activity.

> If half of my brain is severed, am I half me? 

No, this is actually a very interesting phenomenon! If you'd like to read more on hemispherectomies, it used to be a quite common procedure, where a neurosurgeon would remove a hemisphere of the brain to reduce or eliminate seizures. When performed on a patient still in development, i.e. not a full adult, often times the brain was able to adapt and grow to take over what the missing half did.

The thing about the brain is that it's a web of interconnected neurons. We have areas of concentrated activity for certain activities (see the frontal lobe and the motor cortex), however these areas don't have specific boundaries, the function of certain areas is just concentrated there, but can take place nearby or in completely separate areas. If you'd like, I can go into one example of this, which is sight, the occipital lobe, and cortical blindness, which is different from typical blindness.

> My behavioral inhibitions change etc, but then is it no longer me? Or just me behaving differently. 

The ""Am I still me"" question is more philosophy, it's still the same body, same driver's license and ID so I would say yes, but I wouldn't consider myself an authority on the subject. However, brain injury changing your behavior does happen! Read up on Phineas Gage, (specifically the section titled First-hand reports of mental changes as this actually happened to him, and is one of the fascinating cases of psychology. 

If you'd like me to go more in depth on any of the examples I gave, I'd be happy to, just let me know! "

To be fair you started off by saying I was just making excuses, then called me crazy... Wasn't exactly the friendliest way to start it.

> Why bench a guy after a good season before he can even play a game?

They didn't bench him for no good reason though. They declared Emanuel the starter after minicamp and training camp. They had practically 2 months before they played even a preseason game to see where they were at and clearly they felt Emanuel was ahead. Hell during the preseason games everyone was wondering what the hell happened to Attaochu because he wasn't doing anything even against the third stringers. But please don't compare Attaochu to Von Miller yet, that isn't a fair comparison in the slightest.

>Jerry has played in 6 games this year with 0 starts and has 2 sacks compared to Emanuels 0 in 10 starts.

Which is a big reason why Attaochu was in on obvious passing downs over Emanuel prior to his injury.

>Jerry has 7 tackles compared to Emanuels 15. Emanuel has 1 career sack and it was week 1 his rookie year!

Emanuel has 26 tackles and Attaochu has 11 with 3 less games played, thats a pretty sizable difference.

>Attouchu on the other hand has 8 times the sacks Emanuel does in significantly less snaps

That's just completely incorrect. Attaochu has 10 career sacks to Emanuel's 1 yes. But Emanuel does not have anywhere near the same amount of snaps that Attaochu does. Attaochu has 1001 career snaps to Emanuel's 592. I've never once claimed that Emanuel is the superior pass rusher, I've acknowledged multiple times elsewhere that Attaochu is the superior pass rusher and Pags clearly acknowledged this as well giving Attaochu the passing down snaps over Emanuel this season before he was hurt.

>But you say Emanuel is good at seting the edge well so is THE #1 PLAYER AGAINST THE RUN

See this is where you keep losing me. You keep citing Attaochu's play last year as if it has continued in to this season, and I'd argue that it hasn't been anywhere near as good. He's still a good pass rusher but when I've seen him play against the run this year he doesn't look that good at all. I'd argue Ingram's better against the run this year than Attaochu has, and honestly that's disappointing. Trust me, I came into this season thinking that the OLB rotation was going to be great, Ingram was a monster last season, Attaochu looked to be progressing amazingly and Emanuel looked like a monster before his injury in week 1. Attaochu has just looked off since preseason. Sometimes it just happens, I personally think it is far better to have Emanuel and even Tourek at this point in the game to stop the run and to have Attaochu come in as fresh as can be to rush the passer.

>The coaches that are constantly on the brink of being fired every week are clearly great at their job.

I never even made the claim that Pags was a good DC, I merely pointed out there are three guys who have been coaching very, very good linebackers as a career and that they would very likely understand which linebackers can excel against the run or when rushing the passer more than any of us, including the people who work for PFF who are people just like you and me except they're given a rubric to grade players and then post them online on a site that's gained notoriety.

"> Every part of your argument is based on perceived 'implications' and assumptions that just are not there, they are perceived only by you and people who think like you. People who don't think like you do Not have that.

That’s called deconstruction. You pretending it does not exist does not make it all of the sudden not exist. I showed, and I think pretty convincingly, how those implications show themselves –how they can be discerned. This isn’t one of those things where you can empirically show they exist or not, as they are effects and by their nature not tangible. But if you are so sure they do not exist, please show me how you know that. 

> Not one of your comments has been clear. 

Just because you don’t understand the methodology does not mean I was not clear. Maybe try to discern what is actually said instead f just immediately rejecting it. A world of new insight awaits.

Where is the straw man? And it doesn’t make sense because of an autocorrect typo. “Nor” not “not.” That should have been easy to infer. Don’t be like that. You don’t know which all assumptions you make are actually assumptions (your brain does not process information that way) NOR do you know why you make the assumptions you do make. 

> when you refer to America as if it has one mode.

America in terms of the American culture is and does have one more. Of course it can be broken down further, but when speaking about overarching generalities that would be counterproductive. 

> Most Americans do not view homosexuality as bad or funny.

Again, only that they will admit. Most Americans (and by most I mean all) are homophobic as homophobia is so deeply engrained in society that escaping its grasps would be near impossible. Systemic bigotry is not a choice. It is normalized within groups of people/societies. The extent to which it is normalized manifests itself differently, but it is always there. Lots of great works about this. I suggest starting with Foucault or Judith Butler. 

> Every study I have seen agrees with this.

That is both not true and a misunderstanding of everything on your end at the same time. Studies show growing [explicit] support for gay rights, homosexuality, etc. but the studies measuring the internal decision making processes as they relate to this show the exact opposite. That internal bias is VERY prevalent in Americans. 

> B ut referring to our country as some singular entity like, ""America laughs at X or doesnt"" is just going to bring the conversation to a halt.

That may be true. But the onus is on you for not actually understanding the intricacies of the conversation, which I have spent a lot of comments explaining. To which your response has simply been, “nuh uh!”

> The reason I am hung up on it is because assuming things that I didn't say derails communication. I can't defend or explain a concept to you that I don't hold.

You said what I said you said. I quoted you. I may have been hyperbolic in my response, but your rebuttals have not touched on implicit biases at all. I will take some of the blame for assuming you knew at least some of the concepts I was talking about. 

> So stop making assumptions and try to be a little more clear, yeah?

I really have not been assuming. 

> These 2 jokes (given the circumstances we are supposing for the sake of the discussion) are the exact same joke.

Not really. The implications are different about why the world leaders’ dick is in Trump’s hands. But both have a similar problematic aspect. 

> Neither of them imply negativity. 

Both of them do. Though for the sake of your argument I will concede the joke with Trudeau has lesser enough negativity that we need not consider it here [so as to not have your brain explode at the possibility of bad jokes having negative components].

> The only reason the relationship is viewed negatively is because of how YOU AND I feel about Trumps relationship with Putin.

That’s a bit frivolous of a point. The joke hearer goes into the experience understanding that assumption. Just like in the case with Trudeau they would go into the experience assuming that the relationship with Canada (represented by two straight males as close) are not bad and that the then condition that one straight male jerking off the other would be mocking a similar close relationship with homosexual males. 

> Leader A can't tweet with Leader B's dick in their tiny hands.

What I said above still applies. Using sexuality here as a metaphor is going to involve quite a bit of malfeasance. Foucault’s “The History of Sexuality” night show you how. Start there. BUT!!! I will readily and quickly admit that if the mechanism of sexuality in western society were to change, and one man jerking another man off was not seen as sexual or homosexual or anything other than some way of attaining pleasure (stripping sexuality of its identity making processes and discourse control etc) I would WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree with you. But sexuality is not that way. And one man jerking another man off is viewed as a homosexual act. As one woman jerking off one man is viewed as a heteroSEXUAL act. Those things would need to change. 

> As the previous 2 examples illustrate, A and B can be a positively perceived relationship or it could be a negatively perceived relationship. 

Sure. But that says nothing about the semantic properties of analogizing the relationship to the sex at. Structural linguistics is what Themis field is called. 

> My point here, is that if a person thinks that joke inherently implies negativity, it is only because THAT PERSON holds some semblance of the idea that homosexuality is wrong or funny. 

Explicitly maybe. But as a matter of cognitive happenings, not even close. If you had to be aware of WHY for every thought... jeez. Sounds terrible. 

> Here, there are plenty of people (a majority) who do not think that joke implies negativity because they do not share the connotation that gay = bad or funny (we can just say stigmatized, that covers both).

What they think is irrelevant. 

> If your point is that lgbt are an historically oppressed people and that this means that any joke describing a negatively perceived relationship in any lgbt manner is going to be an offensive joke, you are not entirely wrong. It will absolutely be viewed as offensive by SOMEONE. But none of that makes the joke inherently offensive. I can say that the sky is blue and someone who works night shifts will get offended because their sky is black with white dots. Did my statement create the feeling of being offended? Yes. Was my comment offensive? No.

I’m ignoring this paragraph in its entirety because it adds nothing to the conversation. 

> Now, as to implicit homophobia: Yes, it is a real thing. Yes, it is possible for people to not see their own biases or prejusice. No, it is not what is going on here.

It most certainly is. 

> As the examples above illustrate, the joke works without negativity.

It most certainly does not. (It is a completely different joke)


> You seem to be completely hung up on the idea that there is no way the same joke would work without the percieved negativity, but it can and does.

That is exactly what I am doing. Because I have shown several times how that is either not the case or that the joke is changed altogether. 

> YOU are keeping the stigma alive.

Ironic. 

> I would argue that everything you are saying here does far more damage to keeping those negative connotions alive than the joke..

You would lose that argument. 

> because I don't think most people thought anything about the equating of homosexuality to any stigmatization until you brought it up.

THAT. IS. THE. PROBLEM. That is the process of normalizing the implicit bigotry in action. I want to feel like you understand... but I know you were just unintentionally correct. 

Note: I did not like being so condescending but your repeated inability to understand anything U am saying is just depressing the shit out of me.

>Why is is that bad that he wanted a tree for himself? 

Because its unnecessary. It set them up for failure. This is so clearly a mythical story its tragic that you think this really happened. Aside from this, why was god scared that the two of them might also take a fruit from the tree of LIFE? He was nervous enough that he wanted to banish them ASAP. Why would go be nervous? And why set up a tree? Why even set up the OPTION for failure?

Not the poor shepherds.

You are missing the point. Yes we can IMAGINE anything we want. But you are claiming it ACTUALLY HAPPENED. This requires actual evidence not just ""hey i can imagine it so, yeah it happened"". Remember, we are examining this to determine if god is real or not, you cant then go and say ""well god can do anything!"" and just explain away the dissonance. Sorry. Show me some shred of evidence man lived until 900 years old, at ANY point in history. 


>It isn't that he couldn't write it clearly enough, it is that people were all too willing to twist it for selfish motives and too many people followed and still follow those teachings. The message that is disseminated is the accurate message originally taught through the Bible.

The message is accurate according to how YOUR RELIGION teaches the bible. Make no mistake, other religions feel just as strongly as you do. 

>Spiritual creatures can cause animals to speak. There is a donkey later in the Bible as well. 

Yup, fully aware. So, have you seen or heard of a spiritual creature making something speak? What is a spiritual creature? How do you know they are real? The bible tells you this stuff happened, but how do you know it did? These are some pretty insane claims to just take at face value. 

>What is the limitation on miracles performed by God? I am not aware of any. 

So you are just going to accept all of this because of the reasoning ""God can do anything""? Tell me, what exactly COULDNT you explain this way? I mean, i could say i have a religion and there is a unicorn that farts rainbows and he is orbiting ALpha Centauri. You could tell me ""NO THERE ISNT!"" and i can say ""sure there is, god can do anything"". This is NOT a valid explanation, please readdress this point. PLEASE NOTE, this is a known christian logical fallacy! If you go door to door and use that logic, you will be laughed off the porch.

HERE WE GO!! Finally we get down to it. So your evidence amounts to ""i cant think of another way it could have happened, therefore, god"". Nope, another fallacious argument. Its called the argument from incredulity. Please look it up so you dont use that one either in your witnessing ventures. 

Lets for ONE second say a god DID make all this, wonderful! How do you know it wasnt zeus, allah or thor? Why Yahweh, the god that was demonstrably man-made? 

Your logic went as follows: 

1. Gee, this sure is a big, complicated world. 
2. I don't see how it could have come into existence without an intelligence behind it. 

3. Therefore God exists. 
4. Not only that but Its yahweh, god of the christian bible 

What???


Simultaneously you use this logic: 

1. Evolution says that people just came into existence by chance. (which isnt how that works by the way) 
2. I cannot see how this is possible. 
3. Evolution must be false. 

Do you see the error there? You are essentially saying that anything that is complicated or things you cant understand MUST have been designed. People use to use to same reasoning about volcanoes and earthquakes which obviously turned out to be wrong. 
Its just another god of the gaps argument. The same tired old arguments that all Christians use. Not to mention, god being infinitely complicated MUST have had a designer if we are to follow your rules of the universe. 

But no, just because something is hard to understand or seems too perfect to be true, doesnt automatically mean god did it. We dont find these gaps in our knowledge and then just pigeonhole a god in there. As science explains things it forces your god into a smaller and smaller space making him more and more irrelevant. Id recommend against using this argument as well. What the hell are they teaching you about debates at your church?! 

Prove to me a god exists, yours specifically, and we can get somewhere, but once again, proof for god has failed out of the gate. You are in a high control group ran by men, it is a corporation man. The Jdubs arent unique in anything they do or believe.

NONE OF THE ABOVE is meant to be condescending. You would likely enjoy the clips by this guy. He breaks down and explains things like critical thinking, burden of proof and open mindedness.

EDIT:

I know I'll get the usual ""don't complain about downvotes"" comment, but this isn't about downvotes. It's about wilful ignorance. Reddit is one of the most frustrating places when it comes to sharing information...everyone is already as knowledgeable about everything they think they know and anyone contradicting them is simply wrong. End of story, have a downvote. 

I do this for a living. No, not Google Now, but software development. I sit in rooms at large financial services institutes with business analysts, system architects, developers, testers and system admins and we discuss new and upcoming features, bugs, defects and their fixes, we discuss viability, what's the data flow, how expensive is that process to the system, what bandwidth do we need, how many servers will this run on, what are our minimum hardware requirements, what dependencies will that have? You can't solve every problem by, Hollywood TV show style, throwing out words like ""algorithmically"" and have no inkling of what it means and why you're saying it.

Google Now uses the information that you already have. Your emails, your calendar, your location data. Some of that is held by Google, like the emails, some of it updates on the fly, like your location. And some is only on your device, like the nicknames for your contacts. Google doesn't ""know"" who your wife or girlfriend is in the way you mean ""know"". Google isn't ""reading"" your emails in the way you mean ""read"".

I know we all have computers now and everyone thinks they're a nerd and comic book characters are mainstream and geeks rule the world and...the reality is Computer Science is still complicated enough that a lot of you really don't know what you're talking about a large proportion of the time and when someone tries to share their knowledge, even if limited, you can't decide you know better despite not really being able to articulate what you're trying to say in detail. Upvoting and downvoting doesn't make someone more or less right. Facts aren't a democracy.

But then you end up coming off as a condescending bastard when you try too hard to let a person know politely that what they're saying isn't correct, so I'll just leave this one here."
">Not everyone that owns a game checks the internet constantly to see how to counter a specific tactic.

You're the only one saying anything about ""constant"" here. I spend less than an hr reading about this game in a week and still manage to learn a lot. Not trying to condescend, but why is this so inconveniencing? 

Furthermore, if one cannot be bothered to learn, why should the game be changed to cater to them? It's a slippery slope; set this precedent for Sent, and it'll eventually get around to cross ups, overheads, trijumps - literally anything that takes some understanding of the game/characters to effectively counter. I don't think any of us want a bland, shell of Marvel. The point of these games has always been an open-ended engine that allowed over the top stuff to happen. 

That said, I understand where you're coming from. But realize that casual players, who may not be interested in learning the game as it's played_, aren't going to do very well in the first place. A player who can't move around drones probably can't deal with cross up/mix ups or proper keep away either; without knowing what can happen, they won't know their options, realize when they're being trained/baited etc, and are going to eat it anyway. So why does it matter if they lose to Sent drones, Mag hi/low or She-Hulk cross up shenanigans? 

All nerfing so early does is remove options from players who can use them (e.g., remove the reward for learning), while providing little benefit to casuals. This is evidenced by the fact that Sent hasn't actually been toned down all that much; players would couldn't get around drones, still can't. Players who couldn't get in on Sent, still can't. His health nerf is inconsequential to the majority of casuals, who can't hit the guy in the first place. 

But setting a slow character with the largest hitbox in the game, and tons of Sent specific combos/overheads, to the same health as fast rush down characters, is absurd. Storm and Mag can get in and do a lot more, a lot safer, than Sent, and yet have the same health...? Sent's key moves aren't even that great! He has a lot of disadvantages against rushdown. For example, his S is -8 on block, c.M -14 and RP -20. That's a lot of potential for punishing mistakes. 

So even if we were collectively on board with the nerf, I'd like to think the community would've opted for more reasonable adjustments, like reducing the advantage on drones, making S more risky and vulnerable on block, etc. That way casuals would actually gain some benefit, while Sent could keep the health his speed/hit box/stun would logically dictate.

"I told you it was pointless to debate this. You basically asked me to offer my points. So please keep it civil. I have said nothing uncivil. Calling me incompetent or saying that listening to me is painful is not civil. You clearly enjoy debating your issues since you have responded to so many people but it makes no sense for anyone to respond if you're going to treat them that way. And I have read your post, and have addressed specifically what you said, but in some cases you seem to be ignoring what I've said. I'm not trying to make you like the film, which would be silly, but simply pointing out that there are a few inaccuracies in some of your claims. With that said, you asked for it, so I'll try again:

>He was emotional in the sense he was very empathetic but he had incredible control over his emotions, thats why Vader and sidious gave up on trying to turn him to the dark side.

This isn't really true. He very nearly murdered his father and turned to the dark side at the end of Jedi. So he clearly is susceptible to his emotions. So the fact that the dark side comes back when he thought he had defeated it, to destroy his family, I buy that that hits him hard. It's not that that is the only believable path for him to take. He could've tried to fight/stop Kylo, and that would also be believable. But then of course we wouldn't have Episode 7. Luke's mindset in 8 makes sense given the setup and backstory we were told in 7. You don't have to like it, or even believe that it's the most likely path he would take, but it is a believable path, and that is all that matters. This is why I don't believe the argument of ""out of character"" or ""character assassination"" holds up.

>If what kylo did hurt him so much why would he then hide and leave Kylo to go off and do even worse things for the next few years ? Not only does it go completely against the empathetic part of Lukes character but giving up on Kylo goes against the never giving up on hope part of Lukes character

He didn't hide. He blamed himself for what happened to Ben, believed (apparently rightly) that he couldn't save Ben because Ben blamed him for his turn. His ""never give up on hope"" ethos was directly challenged by the very fact of Ben turning. The first person he trains, his own blood, causes him to question and doubt himself. Furthermore, and most importantly, he comes to believe that he will only make things worse, that the Jedi only make things worse (which, historically speaking, is true), and that something better will rise in its place. He is right that the Light will rise with or without the Jedi, but wrong that the galaxy still doesn't need him.

>He practiced for three years between ANH and ESB

If that's true, he would've been practicing...without training. In any event, training is not the issue, it's power. You may want to see Rey receiving lots of training, but you have to understand that there isn't enough time in a 2.5 hour movie to do that, and she's gonna have to leave the island and go do stuff eventually. This is consistent with Luke who never received much training. So your real issue would seem to be with how powerful she is, with the possibility that she might be shown to be more powerful than Luke. Even if that were true, why would that be an issue? Because she's not a Skywalker? Because she's a girl? I don't expect each trilogy to be perfectly consistent with exactly what a Force-user can or cannot do at what age and what stage of their training etc. Anakin Luke and Rey all did incredible feats with the Force at a young age with little to no training. That's consistent enough for me. Mary Sue is still a sexist term because well, first of all, we never really seem to complain about a male character being too powerful, but if we did, we'd just say that, we wouldn't need a special term for it.

>destroy any tension or challenge Rey may face

You're not seriously claiming that Rey faced no tension or challenge in this movie?

>Its making one character way more competent that the other in every way.

Finn is an everyman character. He's really good at shooting, and moderately good at ship/speeder combat. Rey is a Jedi, and is really good at piloting, melee combat and Force usage. She is more talented than Finn. I'm not sure what your issue is though. A female character is allowed to be better at things than a male character. See Hermione Granger vs Ron Weasley.

Re: Leia: I reread your post. So your issue is with the explosion? She didn't protect herself from the explosion though.

>My issue is killing him off before making him any sort of an interesting charatcer and not explaining how the hell he undid all the achievements of the ot hero's

I said it already, but I'll say it again: I did not find him interesting, so I am glad they killed him off. You are free to disagree since you wanted to know more. As for explaining how he did what he did, I think you mean explain the rise of the First Order. Because we see how he undid the achievements in TFA: by blowing up the New Republic with Starkiller Base. As to where he came from and how he took over the FO, there's been tidbits in novels and stuff, but my point was that this movie didn't want to waste time telling his backstory since it's focusing on the characters that matter. This isn't his story. It will be told, but it doesn't need to be told in these films. It's a mystery, for now, and that's okay.

>Either you need to rewatch the scene or you are just making things up.

No sir. I have seen the film 10 times. Perhaps you need to rewatch because what you just described is not what happened, at all. He approaches her, lies about his rank, tries to explain to her the situation, as if she doesn't know, condescendingly tells her what they need to do, then says ""what's our plan."" To describe that as polite is laughable. She, who knows all about his hotheadedness and insubordination which got the bombers killed, returns his condescension in kind.

>Later on when poe see her loading people on transports poe points out how thats suicide and she acts as though she has no trick up her sleeve that will make it work. She purposely acted in a way that would convince him she was dooming everyone to death.

Also not what happened. In that scene Poe is trying futilely to convince Holdo to stop her plan in favor of his plan, which was done in secret and unauthorized. She says, uh, nope, we're gonna continue with our plan.

The issue is, the film tricks you the first time around into not being sure about what Holdo is up to, and evidently for some people it did its job too well. The factor of perspective is very crucial here because in the few times we see her, we only see her from Poe's perspective. Since we know Poe, and don't know her, we naturally think he might be right, or at the very least (given his behavior is pretty ridiculous), we're not really sure who is right. In this case, it was the person from whose perspective we were not watching the scenes who ended up being right, which is very very rare. If you go back and watch the scenes, you will find that we know very little about what Holdo is doing from Poe's perspective; all we know is that he is being insubordinate towards her and so she is not assenting to his demands to give him more information.

>If poe had retreated when leia said they still would have lost bombers retreating

No. The bombers weren't even out when Leia told Poe to retreat.

>when the dreadnaught followed them through hyperspace they would have had to close the distance all over again from scratch and they would have stood no chance of destroying it as they barely managed the first time.

They would have had just as good a chance. We don't know how it would have played out because it's a different situation. It's all speculation so it doesn't really matter. What we know is that in the opening scene, Poe did the wrong thing by disobeying Leia because he got all the bombers killed to destroy a target when the fleet was ready to escape, and he made the fleet wait for him thus putting them at risk.

>you saying the main reason rose freed them as a distraction but the film just decided to focus and celebrate them being freed (to inevitably be captured later that day) instead of destroying the casino and rose and finn escaping which actually have positive consiquences., Do you see the mental gymnastics you are doing here ?

No I actually don't understand what you're saying here, so all I can do is repeat what I said, and what others have already explained to you. Finn and Rose escape from jail and find themselves in the stables. The cops are after them and all the exits are locked down. They took the only available means of escape, the fathiers. They destroy the casino somewhat in the process. When Finn points this out as something worth celebrating, Rose points out that freeing the fathiers was better than destroying the casino. Whether they are recaptured is pure speculation on our point, but it doesn't matter: freeing them felt better for Rose than the destruction (which you could argue by the same logic could be rebuilt). What do you not understand about this?

>Explain why stopping finn is the smarter move when he has some chance of weakening or destroying the canon rather than leaving it 100% which dooms everyone.

I'll say it again. Finn did not have a chance of weakening or destroying the cannon. That's why Rose stopped him. He wasn't going to save the Resistance. He was going to kill himself pointlessly. Therefore Rose saved him."
"> You could recognise Oxford Union “hacks” by the suits they wore, though none took it as far as Rees-Mogg, a rail-thin teenager who promenaded along Broad Street dressed like a Victorian vicar with an umbrella.

Rees-Mogg seems like an utterly pompous twat whenever he opens his mouth. The condescending manner in which he interrogated Mark Carney was incredibly embarrassing in that respect.

Btw, in light of this article, the following Youtube vid is also interesting to watch: Boris v Dave: The History of their Rivalry - BBC Newsnight


"
"Rape isn't a special case at all. The wage gap falls in the category I'm describing. You can't really say whether the same concept applies to it without getting into why it exists, but to the extent it's women being pressured to work less for family reasons, well, someone has to take care of the family so if you reduce their pressure it will increase pressure on men. If it's direct discrimination, then alleviating that will reduce men's wages. If it's higher up positions (the glass ceiling), then fewer men will be CEOs. Etc.

Custody is another example - more men getting custody means fewer women getting custody. Conscription is too.

By the way, lots of feminist rhetoric acknowledges this. Many feminists say men oppose feminism because they're threatened by it. Why would they be threatened if feminism was gonna be neutral or help them?

> Sure, if we increase representation of women, proportionally the representation of men goes down, but if they're still overrepresented, I don't see that as a problem ...

You're not saying men's and women's interests aren't opposed. You're just saying that in this case you care more about women's interests. Fair enough! It also hurt white people's interests to let black people vote in the South, but sometimes that's just how it goes. I think it denies reality to pretend that's not the case.

> a fringe group on par with the WBC.

It seems to me that feminists give more lip service to men's issues because the MRAs exist, even though people also dislike MRAs. It makes perfect sense this would happen - people don't like MRAs, but the reaction I usually hear is something like ""I sympathize with some of their issues but think they're all nuts.""

Without the MRAs, those issues don't get mentioned at all, in my experience. Being a feminist and mentioning them usually gets a response of ""stop mansplaining"" or ""stop derailing"" or ""this is a space for women's issues"" or something, and the discussion never reaches a high enough level to get anyone's attention.

EDIT: I should also add, I don't think it's zero sum. There are tradeoffs, but there can still be policies that are overall better than others. ""Zero sum"" and ""can help both sides with no drawbacks"" are two ends of spectrum, and it's in the middle somewhere."

I realized now that I'm extra cautious when I talk for this reason and whenever I'm saying jokes or similar stuff I feel anxious, not about the comeback, but about the idea of being judged negatively based on his comments.

But I can't believe this, why is that? I was not like this, and better yet, I AM NOT like this. For example, if I have to say something or do something that puts me out there and is potentially embarrassed, I have no problem and I'll do it. But knowing that this guy will surely judge me or throw a comment makes me feel like this, why???

It's like I'm not scared of doing or saying stuff but the idea of being judged by him makes me mad. That's why I think this is not a confidence issue but it's something else..."
">And, considering the A-sides speedrun is about 30 minutes, and C-side speedrun is 15 minutes, and there's no B-side speedrun, I suspect what it contains is mostly death. s. deaths. A lot of.

It's a little more involved than that. Keep in mind that the All A-Sides category doesn't include collectables aside from four hearts to open Core and Core's heart and cassette (which you don't have to go out of your way to collect). So no red berries, and no hearts or cassettes aside from the aforementioned. 

This speedrun grabs all of the collectibles, so if you wanted a more accurate estimate of time spent dying on goldens, you'd want to look at 100%, which is all levels completed and all collectibles aside from goldens obtained. TGH completed the 100% segment of this run just shy of two hours (beating the previous WR). So that makes about five and a half hours spent attempting goldens. IIRC, 2.5 of those hours were spent on 6b-8b alone. 

Also maybe like an hour(?) spent doing PICO-8, in addition to that. It's not required for 114%, but if you're going to run this category you might as well go all out. :P

"> the Germans were as bad as the British or French or Spanish (who destroyed an entire race in Latin America), Americans (Native American genocide), Australians (Aboriginal genocide).

The Spanish didn't destroy a race, they destroyed the culture, by burning the records and Vedas of the natives in order to convert them to Christian.

But the Congo was worst than India or anything else.

I agree the East India Company was nothing more than pirates and brigands feasting on the Mughal corpse, but a large part of why the Britishers made India part of their Empire was in response to their horror at the excesses of the East India Company (in part because the Company used Indian wealth to gain destabilizing political power in Britain).

The British were condescending, racist, and patronizing, but I think they also did feel a responsibility to India post-1857, when they established the British (not Company) Raj. Had they simply left India after the Rebellion, there would have been continual warfare amongst the Indian states, with the other colonial powers grabbing what they could. 

Very soon after the Raj was established, the Britishers did act to bring Indians into governance and administration. That's far from the genocide or enslavement or culture destruction seen in Australia, the Americans, or Africa, and better than the Opium Wars the British instigated in China. As colonized countries go, India had it better than many -- by your own account in the post I am reply to."
">Sorry, I just don't understand how anybody who knows about the history of the Democratic Party specifically could rationally think there is anyway it will ever change

I know a fair bit about the history of the Democratic Party extending back to FDR, and how his project was always to save capitalism from the seeds of its own destruction, to the Obama era and all that that entailed. I might be mistaken in how I've reasoned my way to a differing conclusion, but it's kinda adversarial to declare people with whom you disagree to be irrational. That word carries connotations that can feel dismissive and condescending in nature, depending on the context. Not to say that you are condescending and dismissive; I don't you like that, but it seems to be at odds with the fact that, for instance, a lot of Democratic Socialists genuinely think this is possible. It's kind of off-putting to think they're all just ignorant about 20th century Democratic politics and don't know how to reason properly.

"> I'm arguing that we should not ignore the actions of our side just because the other side do it too.

I don't think anybody ignores it here. It's pretty much a strawman if you claim that any atheist dare to claim that none of the atheists are ever rude/condescending/bad towards theists ever. That's just pretty impossible. The same also could be said about Christians, only the crazy would ever claim that Christians are faultless.

">early israel, before it was a state, would count as a colony under that definition. so israel would be a colonial state in the sense that usa is.

Wrong, Zionists first arrived during the Ottoman empire, the British mandate was given after WWI with the express intent of leaving after the creation of a viable Jewish state (as per the agreement that cemented Jewish support against the Ottomans). Zionist settlers never viewed themselves as part of the British empire nor did they consider themselves British settlers or British citizens (which indeed they weren't). An independent Jewish state was always intended, hence no colonial aspirations by anyone.

>regarding self-determination, in this single-state solution, the nation itself would have self-determination.

That hypothetical nation is not enough, Jews want a self determination for the Jewish nation, the continuous nation which has been denied self determination since the fall of the Hashmonaic dynasty.

>i mean i hate to say this but you could just replace ""jews"" with ""whites"" and ""arabs"" with ""blacks"" and this could just as well be coming out of a pro-apartheid south african.

Arabs have full citizenship in Israel, a full 20% of Israeli citizens are Arab. I protested when people threatened to take away their rights (or any citizens) and I would again but you won't guilt me into accepting another 12 million Arabs. Arabs that persecuted my fathers family for generations. The Palestinians should have their state, separate from us.

>as for ethnicities, i don't care about them and i can't see how they are different from plain old races

Ethnicity is a construct of a shared genetic origin, history, culture and many times religion (though that last one isn't a must). Outside of America ethnicity counts for a lot, most nations in Europe are ethnic nations and even ethnicities which are technically from the same ""race"" can hate one another with a passion. Just look at the Flemish-Walloon divide in Belgium or the Kurd-Armenian-Turk fiasco. Think of ethnicity as a very extended family.

>he's pro-human rights and vocal critic of israel's policies but not against jews themselves. unfair to dismiss him as anti-israel.

Many people just don't understand were Jews are coming from. Jews have lived for generations as second class citizens in countries that refused to accept them. It didn't matter how much they served or sacrificed for their country. Three of my great grandfathers fought in WWI, all of them served their countries faithfully, two were wounded in combat and suffered from that injury all their life. But end of the day they came back to being just Jews. One of them was murdered in the holocaust (amusingly what finally killed him was an old war wound from serving in the Austro-Hungarian army i.e. on the same side as the Germans and for the country Hittler was born in), another had his family narrowly escape massacre at the hands of the same Arabs who had proclaimed themselves his friends and which his family had lived side by side with for generations. Amusingly those are exactly the same Arabs whose descendants now claim they would treat me fairly in country they control. 

All the debate about Israel is secretly condescending towards Jews and everyone just refuses to admit it. You know why? Because Christian and Muslim cultures have treated Jews that way for centuries and even their atheist descendants don't get what's wrong with that treatment. How can anyone choose for the Jews what they are or how they should live? Why does a nation who is documented as existing for more than 3,000 years still forced to prove they are in fact a nation and not a religion even though Jewish culture has always considered it as such. Even the term Jew is denigrating, it is a bastardize version of Judean meant to divide between the Jewish religion and their nationality. In Hebrew there is no distinction between a Jew, a Judean or a member of the tribe of Yehuda, they are all ""Yehudim"".

I'm an atheist, Jew is simply an ethnicity for me, but when people tell me to accept an Arab Muslim rule I get riled and I'll tell you why. These Arabs built a mosque on top of my peoples most holiest site and then forbade them to enter it, forcing any religious Jew to pray to a temple of a foreign god. They then built a mosque on the second most holiest site and refused Jews entry there, to this day Jews can't enter the tomb of Abraham freely, incidently the guy religious Jews believe we are all descendant from and whose Hebrew name means ""high (or great) father"". Even an atheist like me views those sites as culturally and historically important to him. Same Arabs who decided that my people deserve to be considered Dhimmi or second class citizens and put a special tax on them while taking away their right to defend themselves. Now Muslims like to explain to me how Dhimmi's were respected and protected ""like children"". Well jolly, where I come from being treated like a child isn't a sign of respect, not to mention that Jews were perfectly capable of defending themselves in the Arab peninsula until the Muslims decided to massacre, disarm and enslave them that is. The worst thing about this is that I'm being constantly told how Jews living under Arabs would be more just than Arabs living under Jews because the Arabs are more moral now and us Jews are just a bunch of post-traumatic children abusing others because that's how we were treated. Looking at neighboring countries I can't say I'm all that impressed with Arab rule. Arguably Israel treats Israeli Arabs better than some Arab states treat Arabs.

I don't think your evil or an antisemite or racist. I think you are a genuinely okay guy that has never been told what Jews feel or the implications of the one-state solution for Jews and because of that has never actually thought about the other side. Most people in Reddit are like that because frankly no one really cares to look much beneath the surface of the underdog\topdog narrative. I just get tired of hearing how much we are wrong to want what any other nation seems to be entitled to even if their nationality couldn't be traced even 200 years back (see Palestinians)."

"Here let me explain to you why your perspective is both factually and legally wrong.

>Cops notice an empty beer can next to a car so they suspect the guy in the vehicle.

This incorrect the officers noticed an empty beer can in parking lot but there's nothing to suggest it was near the vehicle. At the beginning of the video the subject even states ""How would i put a beer way over there if I'm sitting over here?""

>Nobody wants a potentially drunk person behind the wheel. The guy refuses to exit the vehicle (his first mistake) to simply be checked for intoxication. (Probably to do a breathalyzer test and that balance test) Yes this is an inconvenience to the potentially innocent man in the car, but it's better to waste a guys time then to have a drunk driver killing someone and ruining lives.

You're jumping way way ahead of yourself here. This was not a traffic stop it was a routine interaction that clearly started as consensual encounter. An empty beer can in the 7-11 parking lot does not give officers RAS to detain everyone present for DIP or DUI. The subject would have been free to roll up his windows and not answer a single question and potentially just leave. He cooperated with their questions and from facts we now know he answered truthfully. The cop unfamiliar with the fact that some citizens might not like dealing with police, decided his irritation at being questioned was RAS to detain him for public intoxication. To be frank the cop did not have RAS which mostly likely why all charges were dropped.

> Since he refused to budge force was required to make him exit his vehicle to be checked for intoxication. Now, it may seem that the man was going along with what the cops wanted but there is no reason that they would tackle him to the ground unless he was resisting (his second mistake). If he remained calm and didn't resist he would have been helped out of his vehicle and perhaps sat on the ground. However it is obvious that he continued to struggle against the cops. At this point ""extra"" force was used in order to stop him from breaking free and potentially attacking them. Their objective was to get him on his stomach and get his hands behind his back. Obviously he was resisting so he fell and in turn fell unconscious. He had plenty of opportunities to just listen to the cops and everything would have gone over smoothly. However he resisted and that's why things ended up how they did. 

These officers did a very poor job. From the beginning the officer doing the questioning was escalating the situation with his condescending tone and questions like ""Why are you so angry?"" An officer with verbal judo skills would have used the subject's offer to submit to a breath test (right before he's grabbed and pulled from the vehicle) as an opportunity to remove him from the vehicle without force. ""Sir, I can give you breath test but I need you step out briefly.""

As far as his ""resistance"" I also see it differently. He exited the vehicle and had both hands behind his back when the initial officer decided he needed the subject on the ground. The natural reaction to being thrown down is to try to brace your fall with your hands. Similarly the natural reaction to being choked is pull your elbows into your chest and grab at your neck. These officers created resistance they were fighting against.

>
Edit: I just read the description on that video and it turns out that he had 4 firearms and a knife on him. Imagine what he could have done with those had the cops not taken the course of action as they did. Being a cop you always have to be careful because something terrible can happen at any time

This is pure bullshit speculation. None of that is unlawful and there is no evidence he intended to harm anyone. After subject answered the officers questions if cop had not been so butthurt about about the subject's tone and just handed his ID back and walked away, nothing would have happened."

""People over here have a very different relationship with weapons"" does not imply laws. I though that was obvious, sorry. For clarification, what I meant by that is that culture has the most influence on crime, which is why Gun ownership can be high and crime low. 

Gun crime and general violence have been going down since forever. I remember a great TED talk about that, but can't find it anymore. Will edit if I do.

I'm not against guns (never said I was) and also own a gun which I keep at home (said that). I like my rifle, and I like shooting (who doesn't? It's fun and noisy), but I do think there should be background checks. I'm happy that the government and trust it on some issues. Fighting crime is one of them.

That said, our government is very different from yours. We're a very right-wing country, but we prioritize grassroots movements over corporate influence on profit (one exception is health insurance, and it sucks here). We're a direct democracy and most laws are voted by the people (basically we vote on a dozen laws per year, but the rate varies). Our politics are mostly consensus based, which means there is a lot of infighting. It also means that no one party has any real party at any power. We don't even have a president or a prime minister.W e wouldn't trust politicians with ruling the country. Yeah, we're weird like that.

">Gilligan himself said in an interview that initially Chuck was never intended to be the villain of the piece the way he turned out to be, he was supposed to be a supporting and normal, albeit ill, brother to Jimmy, but watching McKean act out Chuck with a hint of arrogance in his first scenes with Odenkirk gave them the idea to write Chuck the way they did

I gotta call B.S. on this. It's evident in the writing that Chuck was going to betray Jimmy. From the very first scene, when he coos over his Financial Times, basically ignores Jimmy, and Jimmy has to almost beg Chuck to give him a minute of his time to talk. Chuck was written as brilliant and totally condescending. 

This is something that Gilligan frequently does that irritates me. He spoke more than once about being 'surprised' at that Walt was able to 'redeem' himself at the end of BrBa. Bullhockey. They knew right from the start that the show would end with Walt's victory and happy death. Now, the details of how that happened had to be worked out, but they knew all along. 

As for making Jimmy and Kim a couple, I dunno what they were thinking there. Kim knew he was sketchy, with a troubled past, and she kept him strictly in the friend zone, with a little playful flirting now and then. Then she participates in a third-rate low-level con with him, and practically throws herself at him? And why is this couple so popular anyway? I guess because they never show them in any serious disagreement, and they do a nice job of observing the small behavioral details that couples engage in, i.e. they are a nice, normal couple. But this leads right back to your earlier point about making Saul a nice, normal guy with the usual hang-ups and not the uniquely interesting, somewhat troubled person of Breaking Bad."

">Do you think scripture should be viewed user the cultural filter by which it was written, or should it be reimaged and read under the culture of the given day?

>My point that I so poorly fumbled around was this: I feel like scripture should be read under a glass of truth. That you should examine what it's meaning was at the time of writing and still apply that today, despite whatever today's culture deems good and acceptable. 

You articulated the heart of the matter there quite nicely, and if you take scripture seriously, those are some hard questions to ask.

I grew up in a Southern Baptist church and was taught to read the bible as a literalist. I began to notice that the black and white lens I was using didn't always work, because I would open Genesis and read ""God made them in his image, male and female"" and then open 1 Timothy and read Paul using really bad exegesis of Genesis to make claims about the nature of women, that even when God is dishing out consequence upon Eve, Genesis doesn't support. To go from ""your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you"" to women should not teach men, as 1 Timothy suggest, would mean that the logical conclusion of ""I will greatly multiply your pains at birth"" would be that we should deny women pain killers and epidurals today- and I don't think that's what this passage means.

I would see these internal tensions in the text, know they were there, and that I didn't have a good way of understanding them. I felt like I was loosing my grip on the Bible, and it was scary.

You ask if scripture requires us to adopt the cultural filter it was written to, or if it should be re-imagined to be meaningful under our own cultural filter, and the answer is that it depends. We always have to adopt the cultural filter for the task of understanding what is going on in the text, but once we understand it, we have to determine what is at stake. Is God giving the command that men should not sleep with each other because gay sex is inherently wrong, or is it because, given the cultural context, it communicates something negative about the human body and God? We may ask ourselves- well, why didn't God just tell us that there are two sexes, and that who we love or how we express gender doesn't actually degrade the image of God, but could even be a celebration of its complexity? I think Jesus gets it right with the issue of divorce: God allows provisions for divorce in the law, not because divorce is a good thing, but ""because of the hardness of men's hearts,"" which is a backhanded way of saying ""because God is gracious."" I think the restriction against homosexuality came to be as a similar provision- the cultural critique of one-sex theory that needed to happen was not as high a priority as impressing the idea that we have to live in a way that reflects that we bear the image of God in our bodies. But because of the hardness of our hearts, it was better to impress this value in a way that would allow it to endure, rather than impress this value only in the way it finds most perfect expression. Does that make sense? God has to condescend to speak to us in ways that we will best understand, even through the Bible. We think far to highly of ourselves if we think God speaks to us because the fullness of truth is something we can grasp. But if we are careful, and we allow ourselves to see the apparent contradictions within the biblical text, and between the biblical text and the natural world (God authored them both- I don't know why some Christians think that what we observe in nature is going to trick us into reading the bible worse), and ask ""what is going on? why on earth would the text say this? what is at stake?"" sometimes, if we are lucky, we may come to a deeper understanding of the text and the world we live in. Other times we just have to admit that we don't get it, and know there is grace to cover that.

I don't think that we are trying to recreate the original cultural context of scripture in our world today so we can better follow it, nor do I think we are really re-imagining the text into something new. I think a metaphor of discovery works better: we are in the process of discovering the full extent of what the text can do as we read it under ever changing cultural light. As culture changes, so does the breadth of how human's have known themselves, and I think this is a lovely thing that God intended. Not all cultural change is good, and scripture definitely offers critiques of cultural change: materialism in the modern era is a good example, but this doesn't damn all cultural progress as garbage. I mean, hell, slavery is far less culturally acceptable over most of the world today than it was in the bible!

You have to give up a black and white lens of seeing the world. I believe that the world is actually black and white 99% of the time, but that my vision impairs me to see largely in grey: and I used to make the terrible error of mistaking dark-ish-grey and light-ish-grey for black and white, because the distinction was the most clear thing I could see at the time. Everything I have said about homosexuality here is stuff I see as light-ish-grey. I feel I am constantly seeing clearer as I study scripture, but at the same time I am seeing the limits of my own ability to see clearly, and they are staggering limits.

Scripture used to be my anchor to reality, and it isn't anymore. The people in my life, my relationships, particularly within the church, are what anchors me to reality. I am not a Christian because I read the bible, I am a Christian because my parents were Christians before me. I am not a Christian because the Logos became a book, but because the Logos became a person. I had to learn that it is the church that has a book, not a book that has a church. It is possible for the bible to become an idol: it can become a replacement for deeper and more honest relationship with God and each other, because the black and white view we adopt keeps us feeling safe and in the right at the expense of being vulnerable before a world and a God that will certainly transform us. God did not make the world a simple place to be in, and while black and white are important, it should only be a tool for getting to the color and complexity we were meant to experience the world in.

Scripture is great, don't leave home without it, but remember that its intended audience (and I mean all humanity) is far better equipped to receive grace than see the world with God's own clarity and truth. If God ever showed up and told me ""I can show you either grace, or truth"" it would be an easy decision- I know which would do me the most good. I know it is a false dichotomy, but I hope the point I'm making gets across.

Again, I don't know that I've got it right with the homosexuality stuff. I am pretty certain- certain enough to let it determine my moral stances, but I am willing to take a stance in uncertain moral territory not to defend my interpretation of the bible, but because of the ways I have become vulnerable in and transformed by my relationships with friends who are gay. It is not just because I read the bible a certain way, but because I am convinced I have seen my friends' homosexuality give expression to the divine image they carry. 

Don't worry about culture changing too much, because God becomes accessible when he needs to be. Paul legitimately thought Torah necessitated that he try to stamp out Christianity as a Jewish heresy, but God showed up, and Paul had a conversion experience. Some people have conversion experiences when they read scripture, but it is always more than just them encountering the biblical truth- they are encountering the God who is behind the biblical truth, and they are not encountering God simply in the text, they are encountering God in their heart: in the midst of their greatest fears and desires. These experiences are subject to misinterpretation just as scripture is, but the point is that we are not merely being left to our own devices to navigate shifts in culture and figure out how to read scripture. 

I hope this provides you with some new and fruitful ways to approach scripture, and I hope you feel less pressure to see the world in black and white. Keep wrestling with this stuff. It isn't easy, but it is profoundly rewarding. I started arguing not because I expected you would be convinced at all, but because I have a hard time not speaking up on scripture's behalf when I think it is being misrepresented. The fact that you recognize some merit in my process of interpretation, even though I land on the opposite side of an issue as divisive and inflammatory as homosexuality, is an uncommonly mature response. I don't need you to agree with me on homosexuality (though it would be nice), but I do hope that maybe I've been successful in arguing the merit of an approach to thinking about God, scripture, people, and culture, in a way that allows for more ambiguity and uncertainty. I believe scripture to be authoritative, but not in a ""here are all the answers"" kind of way. It is authoritative in a ""here is what you need to know to be able to ask the good and hard questions that will orient your heart, mind, and actions toward deeper, more meaningful relationship with God and others"" kind of way. It seems that in this very conversation, scripture has brought up some of those good and hard questions for you.

Good luck, and I'm happy to take a stab at any follow up questions. I hope my response was helpful

> Theists call it ""God"" and atheists call it ""the Big Bang"" for the most part

Sorta. See, the Big Bang is an event that occurred that tells us a lot about the very first moments of the known universe and why a lot of its properties exist and so on, but we can't know what caused the Big Bang itself, or what existed before it. It does, however, provide us with the knowledge that there was a ""beginning"" rather than an infinite and unchanging universe.

> Personally, I find the Judeo-Christian God to have many human-like qualities and I don't see any rational reason to believe that this force, whatever it is, would be so like us

I can sympathize with this because I used to think from this perspective too, and often still do. But you see, we do place a lot of emphasis on God's transcendence, but we place the biggest emphasis on the way he condescended to humanity to raise us higher. 

See, we believe humans are made in God's image, rather than God being a human conception with human qualities ascribed to him because of anthropomorphism. We also believe that God transcends our understanding and is very mysterious, which is evident in the doctrine of the Trinity (God being both 3 and 1) which is basically incomprehensible to us. At the same time, we believe God is personal and desires communication with his creation; and we believe this as the Bible and the revelations throughout the ages represent a collective history of God's interactions with mankind and his constant instructions for us to pray and keep talking to God. This is also evident in most religions in general, imo, that humble prayer to a higher power seems to be a universal element of the human condition.

We also believe that by the Son incarnating as a man, he opened the way for humans to join with the Father in Heaven, by kind of ""bridging the gap"" between the fallen creature and the perfect Creator, and by taking upon himself the collective sins of mankind and offering a path for us to emulate in order to align ourselves more for the purpose for which we were created. This is God's condescension to humanity.

> If we take the Bible to be the Truth of the universe's creator, I'm bothered by its lack of scope. I would expect it to be more comprehensive

I getcha, but the Bible never claims to be the ""universal, answer-to-everything"" book. We place huge emphasis on it for the importance of its scriptures for understanding the history of God's interactions with man, morality and the history of the Jews and the early Church - but there's a lot of stuff it leaves out because it was never written as the ultimate guide to everything. It's a collection, a library or a compendium of important books for understanding the relevant aspects of faith; but it by no means answers every question there is about God. But it answers the most important ones for us in our current situation.

> humans have believed in numerous gods throughout time, some monotheistic, some polytheistic (fun aside- archaeologists have found references to ""Yahweh"" as part of the Caananite pantheon of gods from the Bronze Age and his emergence as the one God of monotheistic traditions coincided with attempts to unify the polytheistic tribes and consolidate power), but I see nothing to suggest that any one instance is more ""correct"" than the others

Basically, religion is an essential component of man's nature, but like every other - sexuality, hunger, desire for knowledge and so on - it is prone to being corrupted. This is why the Church has so often struggled with heresy and been very scrupulous in putting it down, but also why its never been cruelly negligent toward the traditions of pagans when on missionary work - because in some way they hold elements of the ""Truth"" within them and those are encapsulated into the big picture; the whole understanding of Catholicism.

I can't really speak on the Caananite polytheism issue, but I've heard of it before. I would say that it might represent a corruption of religion like any other; there are numerous examples in the Old Testament of the Jews becoming heretical or worshipping false gods, so its not a foreign concept that even the direct followers of the Lord would be led astray.

> But I do believe that we are part of the universe, and through human (and possibly other species') intelligence and learning about the natural world the universe consequently has some degree of self-awareness. Does self-awareness imply life? I think it might. Does it imply intent? Not necessarily.

I'd always been fond of the whole ""we are the universe observing the universe"" notion when I was an atheist, but I just now had a new insight into that from my Christian perspective. It's true, we are creation observing creation; but we are called by something beyond the veils of our own material world to try and lift our minds beyond ourselves and up to Himself - the Creator."

"> However, I don't think it's reasonable to warrant research be done before any discussion occurs.

In a vacuum, I agree with this line of thinking. But in practice, it leads to some really messed up lines of dialogue that we see causing real-world issues. See: global warming, evolution, the perversion of the ""health at any size"" movement, etc.

I think it's fair for us to discuss ""mainsplaining"" as a thing that certainly happens, and is certainly problematic. But without conceding that research is needed, it becomes impossible to separate instances of legitimate mainsplaining with simply condescending men, or overly-sensitive women. It turns into a tangled mess, and then ""mainsplaining"" becomes a shortcut term that people can use to undermine any real point being made, similar to what people have done with phrases like ""I'm offended at..."" or ""well, that's just my opinion.""

Due to the nature of the problem, it's one that is easy to over-report on. There are a lot of condescending assholes out there, and they are going to be condescending regardless of the target of their condescension. So maybe it's less about gender than some would have us believe."

>If that's the case, then pro-women sexism will remain indefinitely, and you're wasting your time, isn't that true?

However, the members of that minority are going to be more likely to perceive mansplainning (correctly or otherwise).

"> But I also think Deroir did nothing wrong

Here's the thing. I don't think Deroir was rude, or mean, or nasty; he was very polite but that's sort of irrelevant (microaggressions are usually ""polite""). I also don't think he intended to be hurtful or sexist. That said he did unconsciously fall into a pattern of behavior that is hurtful and sexist. This is what I've been trying to say from the beginning. His comment is textbook mansplaining, and that's a sexist behavior, even if you don't stand up and shout the C-word and tell a woman she should go back to the kitchen. You can be sexist without it being overt sexism, and that sucks. It's happened to me before

But to argue that he ""did nothing wrong"" because he was polite and because his intentions were good is counterproductive to efforts to actually fight subtle/covert sexism. It's important to recognize, even if you think her response was out of line, that his comment fits an ongoing pattern of sexist behavior in our society, and even more egregiously in this community in particular. And hopefully we can agree that that means that, intentional or not, polite or not, he actually did something wrong.

Because if we can't agree that mansplaining is wrong, we're going to struggle to really combat these subtle, pervasive forms of sexism (even if we can manage to deal with the really nasty overt stuff)."

>there is only ONE interpretation, and that ONE interpretation

It's well established that you can interpret rules/laws in ways other than their exact wording. I would point to the US Constitution as an example. 

Do you like your right to privacy? Because it's not explicitly stated as a right in the Constitution, but the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to privacy is encompassed in the wording of the other rights it guarantees. Hmmm, imagine that concept...interpreting a document to have a meaning other than what it explicitly states. HERP DERP DERP.

I have tried really hard not to be condescending, but you're just not grasping that what I'm saying is the important thing is that once you pick an interpretation, you stay consistent within the bounds of that interpretation. 

If your opinion is that their interpretation is unreasonable, so be it. I have no issue with that--everyone is entitled to their own opinion. However, if the concept that rules and laws are not always written airtight with no room for interpretation and shouldn't always be taken at face value is something you see as invalid...well then, I don't even know what to say to that. I'm a lawyer--my entire job is more or less based upon that concept."

"> why people choose an activity many have maligned as ""childlike"".

~~Possibly~~ boring anecdote alert: The Anti Gamer Bro-dude

My wife's friend said something about ""gaming"" one day, and 3 heads turned to me. I said ""What?""

""He doesn't understand 'gaming'.""

He went on this condescending tirade about how gaming was for little kids, and probably even kids shouldn't be playing games. I was in school and putting in 10-20 hours a week gaming.

""Do you watch television?"" ""yeah.""

""Movies?"" ""Yeah of course.""

""I know you play sports, but do you watch them?"" ""Yeah.""

""Why do you care about whether one team of dudes you don't know beats another team of dudes you don't know in a game of sportsball? Isn't that really weird? How about TV shows? Movies? Extremely passive activities. You're just vegging out watching them happen.""

""And what's a videogame?"" He retorts.

""Well for one, you're actively taking part. You're solving puzzles, thinking, adapting, improving, watching, choosing, listening. I'm at least actively engaged in it. Even just reading a book or doing a puzzle is more active than the activities you choose to do. Sure I can just gap out and play some games pretty passively, but I think it's still better than dumbly watching most TV shows, and a game can evoke all of the emotions of a movie or show, or whatever, with the little extra bit of satisfaction of having participated.

""PLUS, I'm usually online with my brother and 3-5 friends, shooting the shit while we play, sometimes playing cooperatively as a group, or against each other. Talking about our wives, kids, or just any bullshit...""

IMO most of the stigma left is from people who couldn't afford to have games, or whose parents were highly against them and thus didn't allow it (helping their kids to inherit their parents' bias)

Turns out my ""friend"" here had never owned a game, and only ever played in arcades, and was really bad, so never got to enjoy gaming at all.

Some weeks later he visited and walked in on me actually playing. He watched for nearly 20 minutes while we chatted.

""YO this is actually really amazing. You really doing all that? How did you know there would be something there?""

""Game logic."" (Lol)

""What do you mean, game logic?""

""You get a feel for how puzzles will be made, how game designers will place things. They want things to be inuititive, want things to be discovered. And there are some standby tricks that they like to lean on because gamers find them fun.""

""Like?""

""Turn around when you first start and go backwards. Some pretty early games did this and gave you maybe a beat of a power-up right at the start, like a chainsaw perhaps, that you otherwise wouldn't have gotten for hours. So putting that in a game is not only a secret, but also a nod to nostalgic games from the past.""

""Yooo, that's really crazy...""

He often has questions about video game stuff now, even though he has no interest in playing, lol."
"> So, you were annoyed because that they would not stop doing the nice stuffs?

Of course not.. I was annoyed because they started showing off too much to the point they started me as impressing me as nothing but attention seekers. Yeah we get it you have big ideals, no need to down people who don't give a shit about these stuffs. They would do something and make a big deal out of it on social medias. For example they would do some social service works like cleaning and share the same photos over and over with different idealistic quotes. I think they have taken the Nayak movie all too seriously. Ujjwal Thapa is a bigger culprit here. Look at his profile and all you find is quotes full of ideals. Its pretty obvious they lack a concrete vision and plan but they never admit to it.

">Look at Cristina Hoff Sommers, she actually calls herself a feminist and is about as fair and diplomatic as she can be, and feminists still dump on her constatantly

While I do think that it's fair to call CHS a feminist, I also think that she's not a part of any feminist movement at all and that distinction has to be made and realized. There's two aspects to every ideology really, the philosophical underpinnings and the political arm to it. CHS, while being a self-proclaimed feminist spends an absurd amount of time criticizing contemporary feminism, and she most certainly has a bone to pick with them.

If you read anything from her regarding gender, it's pretty much always to the disservice of feminism and feminist issues. It's really no wonder that so many anti-feminists and MRAs like her - it's because she's adamantly in the anti-feminist movement category. 

Point being, I don't really view her as diplomatic. It doesn't make her wrong, but I think that many people might view her as diplomatic because relative to other people criticizing feminist ideology she's not nearly so vitriolic, but she does have a condescending tone about her work. "
">>Statement 'b' seems to be self-evidently more realistic than statement 'a'.

No, it doesn't seem to be. I don't mean to sound condescending, but just because you say that, does not make it true. 

Forgive me if I'm misunderstanding you, but you seem to base this on some sort of statistical analysis from your perception - basically, you view the odds of someone having value as not great, therefore extrapolating that across ALL people seems absurd.

I'd argue you can't take a stance from a statistical standpoint given we have zero idea of the probability of someone to have value or a purpose.

I can't see how else you'd arrive at your conclusion, but like I said, I can be narrow-minded. So, if I misrepresent your view, please correct me.

You do get to give up. Does giving up bring you happiness? If yes, right on, live your life man. If it doesn't, you're actively working against yourself for no other reason than thinking something is unlikely. Once again, that's your prerogative. I see that as wasted time and energy. Because it does take energy to give up.

I'm not a fan of your marathon and violin examples. Do you truly believe that there exists a person (barring physical or mental disability) that could not, after several years of practice (and for this thought experiment, I need to define practice as working on the skill with direction and desire), play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star? I think that claim is absurd. People aren't good at stuff because they either don't practice or practice in a useless manner.

>>But, eventually, you also have to be realistic. Some people are too broken to ever really have a worthwhile and meaningful life

"> BG2 had a character that basically had serious self esteem and trust issues that you had to work through before you could get anywhere at all.

What BG2 (and PS:T to a lesser extent) did so well was making it based off time and making it build up naturally. Or mostly naturally.

(Almost?) All your party members talk to you, not just your romance interests, and they talk to each other too. So this isn't some ""MC-senpai you're so special!"" attribute, it's just a gameplay mechanic that's introduced and makes sense logically, of course these people are gonna have conversations and showing us their interactions is fairly understandable. 

And then as you talk to certain party members, if you get on well with them, you'll grow closer, they'll open up more and something can develop. Or, if you've got multiple of them in your party, they'll get annoyed and fed up with watching the other try and get your attention instead. Jaheria and Viconia think Aerie is whiney and annoying, Aerie gets sick of Jaheria's patronising attitude, and everyone gets sick of Viconia's condescending, selfish nature.

Meanwhile in Mass Effect or DA:O it's instead just broken up into an episodic nature, make sure you go talk to your crew after every mission, if you talk to Tali/Morrigan enough she'll fall in love with you. Some of them are written well enough, but it's always clear that this is a mechanic for Shepherd/Warden and it's clearly just a semi-shoehorned in gameplay device. Instead of BG2 where conversations happen naturally as you walk along safe spaces, they only happen in the designated ""TALK TO TALI HERE"" zone.

Basically I liked how it worked in BG2 because it evolved from something that felt natural, it felt reasonable for the characters to strike up a conversation and having it grow through in-game time (and with some events taking MUCH LONGER than others) it felt believable that everyone was growing closer together.

Getting with Aerie only took listening to her, given how lonely she was. It was a simple, light, and relatively happy romance. It was an innocent first love.

Viconia was fast, you could be sleeping together before the end of the second act. But actually staying together rather than falling apart took a lot of time and especially a lot of patience.

Jaheria was fraught with guilt and doubt, and (if it didn't bug out) took goddamn forever. You might only complete it and actually get together shortly before the final parts of the game.

"> It sounds like she herself was an immature person who hadn’t really thought things out clearly

I think her greater point is that modern feminism often encourages that.

The victim mentality and black-and-white thinking in the discourse can lead women to think about these issues in infantile ways, which can lead to warped beliefs going unchallenged (because challenging them makes you a misogynist!). And then there's no incentive to ever think things out clearly. The gender politics debate is very polarized. They don't encourage gray area discourse. Look how quickly she was painted a misogynist for saying ""hey let's try listening to people, some may have valid points too and maybe we can all learn from each other"". The feminist populace wanted none of that. Burn her at the stake! 

Not all feminists are immature. But it means that if you have an immature woman who identifies as a feminist, there's no real means to call her out on her immaturity. She can pull the ""privilege"" card, close her ears, kneejerk react, and never self-reflect. This is exactly what Cassie Jaye admits she did before making the documentary, and she is certainly not the only young feminist to act like that. 

This is not to say ALL feminism is this or that. But feminism, in not allowing itself means to be fairly challenged and scrutinized (challengers are dismissed as misogynists), has created a cocoon that shelters women with immature beliefs and stunts them from gaining a balanced view of the world.

Sadly I know 30-something women IRL who are far more immature than Cassie Jaye used to be. You cannot call them out on their immaturity, because patriarchy. Everything they say must be right, everything a man says that isn't 100% agreement is patriarchal mansplaining and should be ignored. If they are always right about everything, why would they ever bother to reexamine their thoughts or beliefs?"

Patriarchy is more complicated than that, patriarchy is oppressive to both men and women, and it manifests not just at the highest levels of society, but within families and social groups.

In other spheres, there's been shockingly little advance. Men still talk over women in social gatherings, women are still expected to be the primary care-givers to children, men are still expected to be rational and unemotional, male rape is seen as a joke, women are supposed to be sexually passive... and so on.

Patriarchy is the system in which men play the dominant role, and women the submissive. Patriarchy vs feminism is not masculine vs feminine, but masculine and feminine vs not basing those roles on gender.

>Here's the thing. You saying we have a misunderstanding of patriarchy is like Donald Trump saying you just don't understand capitalism. It's rather arrogant. The MRA's that I've heard talking about it (myself included) have done their homework.

It's not arrogance, this subreddit is here to ask about and answer questions from the anarchist point of view, so I speak only from that position. From that position, the way you are using the term patriarchy is fundamentally different to the way that we as anarchists, as feminists, are using it. Unless we bridge that gap, we can't have a dialogue about it, because we're talking about two different things.

>I think Feminists and MRA's are equally guilty of refusing to meet in the middle. And in my opinion that middle ground is some kind of socialism.

Plenty of MRA's are guilty of refusing to listen to feminists, of an irrational hatred and misunderstanding of the term feminism, and in some cases severe latent misogyny.

Plenty of feminists are guilty of being incredibly patronising and condescending to MRA's and of refusing to acknowledge some of their issues publicly (whilst occasionally doing so in private).

In short, I think that MRA's have raised a lot of real issues with real problems that exist and need to be addressed, but they have come up with an analysis and solution to these issues that is often entirely contrary to what needs to happen.

I don't think it's a gap that is easily bridged, but we can begin to do so if we start by taking each other a little more seriously.

"> The Mooch was bizarre.

If you listen to ""The Mooch"" in conversation with reporters, he's actually a REALLY effective communicator, or the best you might expect in the Trump administration. Despite being as anti-Trump as they come, his performance on Real Time a few weeks ago made me actually respect the guy a small amount, because he was so easily able to make Frum and others seem like raving partisans against his calm, reasonable tone. Wheras SHS is defiant and smugly condescends to reporters, Mooch almost makes you want to root for him, even if you hate everything he stands for. 

I was actually shocked because I expected him to be some hot-shot arrogant NY banker type but he's really great at selling Trump's insidious and ludicrous ""policies"" if you can call them that, in a way that an average person would be fooled into thinking Trump is Reagan v2.1.

Yes, yes I can because their response was woefully inadequate. Instead of explaining how there was no agenda pushing and the event would be lowkey, the dev was condescending, and gave us nothing, and even when Jagex did respond 12-24 hours later, they didn't give us any real info about it.

>You haven't named any government agencies that don't live up to your standards, though.

Pretty much all of them, at the federal level. People on the left tend to approach criticism of government by running straight to the things that are legitimate functions of government to defend all functions of government.

To give you the example you asked for, I'd cite the existence of the FDA. If a food company screws up, they could suffer for years because of the public backlash. We get to tell a food company (with our dollars) that screw ups aren't OK. When the FDA screws up, there is absolutely recourse that the public has.

At best, we can elect a congressman who will perhaps join with other congressmen to put pressure on the President to direct his HHS secretary to fire the people who screwed up. 

That doesn't exactly give me confidence, and certainly none of the immediate satisfaction I get when I can immediately switch to another brand in a free market.

Uhh, yeah, it should.

For one, beauty is relative. For another, if I own the land, and I want to cut down some trees, pave the ground, and build skyscrapers, and some guy in Virginia doesn't like that, then he can just get the hell over it.

"> how women find a woman dominated workplace hostile

It's a common and hurtful trope for women to say they hate drama and gossip, that they don't get along with other women, that women are catty, that they're different, etc. instead of looking at their female colleagues as allies. It's comparable to the ""real women do this"" phenomenon, where women feel that they have to compete with and put other women down to prove their worth instead of standing on their own merits. 


Male dominated workplaces can present a different set of challenges, hostility that is more subversive and widely accepted, where ""mansplaining"" is a real thing that happens but people don't see it because that sort of interaction is so common and seen as normal behavior."
"> Men can direct chickflicks or write romantic novels. Just like women can make action movies etc.

You are correct that they can (and do), but a big reason why a lot of women on this thread care about this question is because they don't do it well 100% of the time. The common conversation around women's representation of media is a major effect of this, that men have been the primary content creators and that how women have been historically portrayed in popular media has suffered. Shockingly, women do tend to have a more accurate notion of how it is to be a woman than (most) men do. I get why men might be caught off-guard by this question, but OP (and many women with experiences like hers) are coming from a place of having been dismissed and condescended to by nerdy men and/or expected to be some kind of nerd-fantasy avatar of a woman based on some of the inaccurate portrayals of women in nerd culture. It's completely understandable why, if the OP wants to weed out men like that, a question like this is a pretty attractive shorthand for identifying men who believe women are capable of creating good content and don't say things like ""[Woman writer] might ruin Rick and Morty because women aren't funny."""

Then let's do.

>but the facts behind them are solid and nuanced, definitely not biased.

I'm not sure how you can say that with a straight-face when the impetus for the question from Crocodile Tears Girl was his referring to Israel/Israelis as Nazis. I'm pretty sure that shows both bias and a lack of nuance. ""They're literally Hitler"" is what I'd expect from Tumblr users, not an educated gentleman who studies and speaks on the topic.

>But you cannot ignore key players in any regional conflict

Yet we routinely do when it comes to the situation with Israel and the Palestinians. I'll be the first to admit that the Palestinians got the shaft, but who gave them the shaft? The United Nations, acting on proposals from European nations, who were only too happy to see the Jews shipped off somewhere after centuries of using them as scapegoats with the end result of exiling and/or murdering them as the circumstances dictated. The only thing that finally put an end to it was the bad taste left in everyone's mouth upon seeing how Hitler finally took that history to its inevitable conclusion.

So Europe, through the UN, puts guns in the hands of a bunch of people who had just gone through a genocide, tells them ""this is your stuff now"" and cuts them loose. I've yet to see Europe take any responsibility for this outside of the occasional stern statement directed at one side or the other.

Sure, we can blame Israel and its people. We can blame the multiple Arab nations that don't want to absorb the Palestinians or give them any measurable support (outside of bounties paid to the families of suicide bombers). That happens routinely, but I hardly ever see anyone point back to the people who actually created the entire mess in the first place.

Israel is there, and it's not going anywhere. Palestinians should have there own state, too, but it's not going to happen while Hamas is shooting rockets into civilian populations from UN schools and hospitals. I don't know what the solution to the problem is, and better minds than my own have tried to solve the problem and failed, but the solution isn't calling Israel and its people Nazis and ignoring the acts of Hamas."

Bullshit dude. How do you think the thousands of wonderful bands exist? Queen? Guns n Roses? Rancid? The Ramones? The fucking Beatles? ELO? The tons of others I could name? Did their quality drop when they hit it big? No. Most of them started really making their greater songs once they had the money to support them, giving them the time and resources to really focus on making good shit. Plus you're making the horrible assumption that to these people, their art is a hobby like it is for you. Music, art, etc. is their life, not their hobby. That's why they made it into a career, because it's all they want to do, and they want to get paid for it so they can do it and also fucking eat.

An ""unnecessary sequel"" is more or less your opinion. Maybe the author never thought it was ""unnecessary"" and would have written it anyway.

Maybe that artist was particularly proud of that piece and it just wasn't what you typically find more pleasing.

>No one should aim to build a career focussed on the production of art, if it turns out to be very successful that´s one thing but solely creating art with the intention of making money is just wrong.

It really isn't. Like I said earlier, you're thinking of art purely as a hobby. A huge amount of people do not. It's their life. It's their career. Nobody should tell them ""your art is going to suck because you want to do it for a living."" That's a shitty thing to say. It's a shitty thing to think. If nobody should build a career focused on the production of art, you wouldn't have actors or actresses, film makers, writers, costume designers, set designers, script authors, directors, musicians, clothing designers, web designers, hell you wouldn't even have video game or movie merch. All of those people go into those careers so they can make money doing their art. You aren't thinking of literally any of them.

But the problem is that OP didn't make his intentions clear and there is nothing unreasonable about asking to be paid for your time. The dude replying was kind of rude but there isn't anything wrong with asking for money for your participation in someone else's project.

He murdered and enslaved his daughters to make the first Valk'yre then brainwashed the mortals that worship him to fight and die for his causes. He knows the fate of the universe is on the balance and continues to demand pointless trials for his amusement. He's not all that powerful and if he ever became a problem to Azeroth he would just be a raid boss we'd actually get to kill, instead of just being a raid boss we have to bring to near death.

If we actually tried to attack him, he could just destroy the Aegis as a final ""fuck you, if I lose, you do too"". He also wouldn't take Sylvanas stealing away his Val'kyr kindly; he's extremely petty. Face it. Sylvanas' actions in Stormheim, particularly her deal with Helya, jeopardized literally everything that everyone else was fighting for, because Sylvanas herself is too selfish to see past her own rotting nose.

She's also demonstrated a complete lack of honor given by how she stabbed the living humans of Lordaeron in the back the moment she was given the opportunity without even trying to coexist.

> I like how you bring up how you wonder why the elves can even tolerate the orcs. Probably because they can see the bigger picture and aren't close minded racists? They allied with the orcs despite being enemies

Let me rephrase. The only reason why Quel'thalas left the Alliance at the end of the Second War was because Terenas decided to not exterminate the Orcs. The humans not repaying blood for blood is the sole reason why the Alliance fractured after the Second War. Alleria is shocked that her homeland is affiliated with the Orcs, whom she, despite being a member of the Army of the Light, hates with a violent passion, and even more so that her sister is leading them.

Quel'thalas, who was already pretty condescending to most of the Alliance to begin with, pulled out of the Alliance the moment there was no longer any real threat, and unlike Gilneas, demanded aid when Quel'thalas was later sacked. If they wanted Alliance aid, they shouldn't have left the Alliance.

On top of that, they get all pissy at Jaina when she purges the Sunreavers from Dalaran after they assist the Horde in attacking Darnassus. If anything, the Blood Elves are a faction of traitors.

But sure, by all means blame the entire Alliance for Garithos resenting that."

I can appreciate your response because it sounds like you really love your wife enough to take time out to understand her hair, and a definite kudos is in order. But not to sound condescending, I've been living with my texture for my entire life. It's like someone telling me they know what it's like to be black because they're married to a Black person and read books on it.

>My wife's natural hair takes more work than that by the time it's a >few millimetres long.

If your wife is dealing with new growth while her hair is relaxed dealing with the two textures does take a lot of work, which is why I opted to just cut out all the relaxed parts when it came time to go natural. From what I've seen on others trying to make the straight parts curly or the curly parts straight so that the texture is uniform takes time and work. 

When I had relaxed hair the first days were easy. Yes I could wrap it up and brush it out in the morning, however that goes away when you wash it. To get it back in that state either requires heat or curlers to straighten it. Not to mention dealing with curling irons or other heat implements. I don't even need those anymore. For detangling I can spritz it with oil and water and easily detangle it with a comb. Waking up I can pick it out and just go. After washing it I can let it dry naturally so that it clumps up or I can stretch it out with braids for a more fluffy look. I don't have to worry about rain or humid weather, scratching my head, the ""grow-out"" phase or anything else. 

I can tell you though that when I was younger and when my mother was dealing with it I would probably say everything that you just said. But I as I got older I learned how to properly take care of it, and it's so much easier.

If you're really a bit more curious about my point of view you can check out nappturality.com and see tons of other women dealing just fine with their natural hair of all lengths and textures."

I now known this to be rubbish. It's more that AAs are usually or normally needed, but not 'always needed' but that's not even what I objected to in what you said. You posited that they're mandatory/necessary and that going without them is to a person's detriment.

I personally don't advocate against AAs, though I do gently suggest that those of us not ""desperate"" should consider trying 90 days on E without AA before taking an AA if they have the mental health stability for it. 

It took my blood levels 40 days (on two separate occasions) to drop 95% using E only. That's a far cry from 90 days.

Berners like to pretend that nothing was known about the seriousness before the first Democratic debate in October, but let's take a look:

Press release from TWO inspectors general (State IG and intelligence IG) in July concerning TS/SCI emails:

 http 

> These emails were not retroactively classified by the State department; rather these emails contained classified information when they were generated . . . . This information should never have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system.

CIA/NGA review in September confirming it:

 http 

> Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and the State Department disputed the inspector general’s finding last month and questioned whether the emails had been overclassified by an arbitrary process. But the special review — by the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency — concluded that the emails were “Top Secret,” the highest classification of government intelligence, when they were sent to Mrs. Clinton in 2009 and 2011.

His goal could be to point out to the rest of us that they do. I don't think attempting to persuade feminists would be effective. I am not sure I've ever witnessed a feminist concede any point to a critic about anything, ever.

>2) This is because viciously mocking an individual feminist for expressing a legitimate complaint is unlikely to win her over to your side.

The probability that Watson would ever be won over to Dawkins side through polite criticism is 0%. People like Watson are not receptive to criticisms from ""old white men"" or from anyone they deem a sexist or a non-ally.

So, both your first and second point criticize Dawkins for not doing something that would be completely futile. 

>His letter was tone-deaf in that it implied that Watson had no right to complain about being mistreated while women in other parts of the world were being treated even worse.

I already argued that this was false. Saying that X > Y does not mean that Y = 0.

>. Even a strict Utilitarian should be able to see that we can address both problems at once

Imagine making this argument to a group who called themselves the ""People dedicated to the Ending of Poverty."" They all had decent jobs, but 99% of them complained about how they weren't paid enough. Only 1% worked on poverty relief for people in extreme poverty.

Would it not occur to you that maybe you should criticize them for not working on actual poverty?

This is how I see feminism in the West. Almost no feminists work on the most serious issues facing women. Instead, they complain about ""nerds in the office"" or some other trivial nonsense.

Arguing that you can work on manspreading and women being raped and enslaved is an incredibly feeble response. If there were thousands of feminists working on the latter, I would agree with you, and would not mind the occasional feminist writing about mansplaining.

But I could find 20 articles from prominent left-leaning feminists complaining about manspaining far more easily than you could find 20 articles from prominent left-leaning feminists criticizing Islam. In fact, I could find 20 articles from prominent left-leaning feminists defending Islam faster than you could find 20 criticizing it.

I am not merely arguing that feminists have misplaced priorities in practice. I'm arguing that the net effect of their present actions is actually harmful to women since their efforts to defend Islam cause far more harm than is offset by shaming men for manspreading.

Fair enough. Could you give us some contrast with a survey asking book readers, movie viewers, or any fictionnal media why they read, why they watch movies, why they do what they do? Escaping reality is a common answer everywhere, as I tend to see, but I may be wrong.

I mean, it's a pretty shallow base to argue that ""game are addicitves""; Some are. Some are even created to be addictives, especially on mobile, and there are design patterns to make them addictives, so Game designers should know how to do that.

According to that, yes, video games may have very soon - maybe even now, more than ever before - an addiction problem, at first within the mobile gaming community, but with the loot boxes becoming mainstream in pc games, it may extend to some other platforms.

So yeah, all this to say, prepare some real arguments instead of the survey about reality, because there is more insteresting things to talk about (and I know it kinda feel condescendent here, but it was not my goal at all).

"> Stick to my example bank. Where does gold enter the equation? The bank debits a thing of value (fiat currency or gold) and credits a deposit liability. Whenever I ask questions here people always try to steer it to whatever thing they are currently into (it was bitcoin last time). 

Damn, we need to get on the same level on so many things here to even start a conversation. I feel like you believe people here are “steering” because you don’t see how all these things are connected (money, value, fiat and bitcoin. And I don’t mean any of this in a condescending way, we just aren’t seeing the same picture here. I’ll try to synthesize my view.

Why did I mention gold? Because non-backed currency is an extremely new thing, throughout human history this wasn’t the case, paper money always was backed by some commodity and that commodity was seen as money, while the paper was just a easier way of storing and carrying money. Something resembling paper money was only introduced in the West after the Crusades as a way of transporting large sums of money between Europe and the Crusader States by merchants and pilgrims. Then credit appeared in Italy’s merchant city-states shortly after that.

Why is any of this relevant? Because the value wasn’t in the paper, the paper was just a receipt. The value was in the gold/silver that that paper could return you. Of course, people started using the paper receipt as money because you didn’t need to go to a bank and withdraw all the time. However, and this is the key here, people would withdraw if they felt that the bank was heading south or that it was fraudulent, because, again, the only value that the paper receipt had was in the gold it represented. Keep in mind that private banks in the early days would issue their own notes, state banks only became a thing around the 17th century.

That was sort of a problem in the first year or two of my relationship with my husband. He would condescendingly explain the most basic topics because he didn't know how much I knew. It doesn't help that he's a service academy graduate whereas I'm still working on my associate's degree. He couldn't even begin to guess what I did or didn't know, and wound up assuming I knew nothing because he was trying to include me in conversation.

He's literally one step away from calling for a genocide, if he hasn't already. 


Hates on gays? How's that? Because he didn't support federalized gay marriage? Or just because he doesn't fit in with your view of what gay people should be. Also yep he probably called someone nigger in one of his videos, but can I get the context please, the source? Saying ""nigger"" and ""faggot"" openly is his way of fighting words that are hateful, for example, his college tour is called ""The Dangerous Faggot Tour"". Similar to how homosexuals embraced the word gay. His strict adherence to the rule of only dating black men sorta weakens most of the comments that he hates black people, unless, of course, he doesn't actually date black men right? He must be making it all up, he must hire black men to be with him, and internally he hates black people, why of course, it can't be that he just disagrees with the views you have on black communities. Te right is just using him right? Just how Republicans used Ben Carson, or Thomas Sowell, or Larry Elder. It can't be that someone within a community opposes some of the aspects of that community. Sheer level of anti-Muslim hate? Sure, he isn't a Muslim apologist, and frequently debates those who are, but I'd hardly call him any-Muslim.

Maybe X, but not Ali, there is a fine line. Israelis are ethnic nationalists, are they Jewish supremacists? No. And to say they are both equally racist is ,without being too mean and condescending,(which I have been) laughable. When someone is a white supremacist, try almost always are white nationalists.

So you are wrong, Donald Trump is a racist, and he is connected to the alt right. 

Yea, brought against him, wonder why you used that language there. Maybe because the case isn't clear, and it was settled.( http  His dad was allegedly arrested at a KKK rally, not for being in the KKK, you may not care, but I certainly do.( http  Started the birther movement? Really? He started it? Yea, I'm sorry Trump isn't smart enough for that. Most importantly, there is nothing inherently racist about the birther argument. That's a pretty big deal if the president isn't constitutionally legitimate. He hired Steve Bannon, yes, and I explained to you already about Bannon, and we are yet to discuss his comments on his site. Only lukewarmly disavowed the alt right? Past our own subjective ideas of what the lukewarm is, and the context of the media concerning that, I simply don't think that is a good point to prove that Donald Trump is racist, considering as I have already said, nobody, especially an old man like him who isn't ingrained into internet culture, can truly decipher what the ""alt right"" is. And lastly, saying the KKK ""are good people"", please, source.

Then take the rest of the day paddling along the Florida Bay. Shark Valley is quite a drive just to be up a few stories. I think it's more fun and a better experience from a canoe then a crowded platform, especially since a chunk of your day will be spent driving instead of exploring.

Yes, by definition. Do you support a state? If yes, then you're a statist. Being a statist is a binary state. There are some statists that more rabid, violent, and silly than others, but you either are, or you aren't. 

> I'm Libertarian, but I'm not an Anarchist.

You may call yourself a libertarian, but if you're not an anarchist, you are probably a conservative who is (understandably) unhappy with the GOP. I'm not saying this to start a fight or quibble over semantics, but let's look at the beginning of the opening paragraph from the Libertarianism Wikipedia article:

>Libertarians seek to maximize autonomy and freedom of choice, emphasizing political freedom, voluntary association and the primacy of individual judgment.

If you support a state in any form, you oppose voluntary association and the primacy of individual judgment, because the state is inherently involuntary, and makes judgments collectively. The ideology of statism is inherently at odds with libertarian values - in other words, if you believe that government, even ""limited government,"" is something that should be imposed on others against their will, that is inherently opposed to libertarianism.

> Do I like it? No. It's evil, but it's the lesser of many evil options.

I would disagree, I think it is the worst evil of all options. It removes accountability and disincentivizes mutually beneficial cooperation, among other unintended consequences.

It's okay, though. I thought I was a libertarian for awhile when I was in fact just disillusioned by bipartisan politics. I didn't really have a very firm grasp of libertarian values, and (like most people) I bought into the myth that the state is a ""necessary evil"" because that's what I'd been told by almost every person I'd ever met.

I genuinely hope this doesn't come off as condescending. It isn't meant to be, at all. I'm not saying this to inflate my own ego, or make you feel bad, or make myself feel better, but the belief that the state is a ""necessary evil"" is contradictory to libertarian values. It's okay, though, most of us here probably thought the same way at one time, myself included. I think you'll find that, if you follow the train of thought that brought you to the realization that ""big government"" is a problem, you'll eventually reach a similar conclusion: government itself always makes itself bigger, and relies on popular support to inflict tyranny - by design, not in spite of corruption or poorly worded or enforced legislation. It is illegitimate to its core, and uses disguises like democracy, fairness, scare tactics, and the appearance of cooperation to rule over virtually all people on the planet."

I've had him stop the car and spend a half-hour on the side of the road, shooting (on what's supposed to be a 3-hour day trip) because the light was ""just right"" on something I didn't even notice. If I had to guess, he's got a DSLR on him when he runs to the corner store for a soda and lotto ticket."

"Ok I suppose I'll just quickly go through most of your responses since it seems you put some effort into your post as well. (Also it seems you dislike RD more than you are angry with me so we're all good XD)

> And no, it's not ""uptight"" to not want your friend to physically injure you, get your coat all dirty, and then laugh about it and say ""no need to thank me"" like she did you a favor.

Like I said before, just because she was a bit of a dick in the first episode does not mean she still acts the same way in recent episodes. As for that incident in particular, I wouldn't consider what she did to necessarily cause much pain or ""physically injure"" twilight as she seemed more annoyed than hurt. And Rainbow did put at least a half-hearted attempt towards helping twilight afterwards. I'd chalk the whole situation up to RD having trouble apologizing to others rather than trying to be an intentional dick, as I know a couple of nice people in real life who would act similar.

>You say she doesn't use magic, but all ponies are magical in their own way.

I honestly do not know if Faust has confirmed this to be fact or not, but I simply meant the type of magic unicorns use.

>Twilight Sparkle is the only pony who could soothe Ursa Minor. Fluttershy is the only pony who has control over butterflies.

While probably most couldnt soothe an Ursa Minor, I still believe a select few, such as the princesses, could have stopped the Ursa as well. I do not consider that to be a feat nobody else could have done. In fact, a sonic rainboom kick to the face would probably stop the bear in its tracks as well. As far as fluttershy, I was specifically talking about how I consider RD to be the most awesome and talking to butterflies is not what I consider awesome. (Also it's a little hard to use logic when talking about Pinkie)

As for the apprenticeship of Celestia, that was more of joke, but I still believe there is some merit to it. When Celestia first talked to Twilight, Celestia was not interested in the slightest about Twilight's leadership traits or anything about her personality for that matter. Only her sheer power at such a young age, which I believe RD would have as well if she was a unicorn. Now I obviously think she would have flunked out pretty quickly, but she may have been selected at the start instead of Twilight because she was able to unleash her power alone and before Twilight could. 

>Rainbow Dash says something like ""just stand back and leave it to us,"" NOTICEABLY hurting Spike's feelings

Again, I doubt she does this intentionally and I do not believe it is that apparent as none of the other ponies seem to notice either. I think its obvious that if we are complaining about how the ponies mistreat spike or ignore his feelings, Twilight is the main offender, not RD.

>Rainbow Dash is bragging, whereas there is no scene of Rarity bragging

This is where I believe Rarity is worse than RD with the ego. Rainbow does brag much more than Rarity, but unless its specifically about her physical abilities, I think most would agree she does it more for attention rather than truly believing she is better than others. Rarity, on the other hand, manipulates some of her closest friends (as well as others) to doing things for her. I feel she does this because she truly believes that her problems and concerns are more important than others. She will intentionally put others into very uncomfortable situations for her own personal gain whereas RD just talks a lot. The episode Castle-Maneia is an example that she still does this even in season 4.

Now again, the dragon incident was very early in the show and I believe she is evolving into a much better person as time goes on. For that episode in particular though, I probably would have agreed with RD before we got to see the ending. If I was going into what could be an extremely dangerous situation and someone was so scared they couldn't even move, I sure as hell would not want them coming along and possibly becoming a liability. She did not tell her to her face, nor did she make fun of her to anyone. She was just brutally honest with her feelings when talking to twilight (only twilight) and it seemed justified to me. If she was truly the asshole you seem to think she is, I believe she would have told fluttershy to just fuck off and go home for being useless.



 Another one of things that drives me crazy about most of the reasons people dislike rainbow is the fact that almost every thing is exclusive to the rainbow of the first season / beginning of second season.

>I believe I have already completely disproved this statement with concrete examples.

Not including anything from the earlier seasons, this is (hopefully) every argument you have put into your post about recent episodes.

 Rainbow says something to spike that hurt his feelings
 She brags in a recent episode
 She says ""nice try"" in a condescending tone
 She says something hurtful to somepony
 She brags about being Daring Do's biggest fan when that may not be the case

Looking at this list, i still can't see how you believe she is truly an asshole. I understand that her bragging can be very annoying at times and she may not always think about how her words will affect others before speaking. However, I do not think these are strong arguments towards her being an asshole. In fact, if we listed everything Rainbow has done that was selfless or kind in these episodes, I don't think theses points would hold up very well.

Well this was fun, would love it if you pointed out flaws in my arguments and tried to prove me wrong."

">Thanks for taking the time to respond. I think the difference we are having is that I see “toxic masculinity” as a cultural idea of how a man should be and you’re seeing it as a statement to define all male behavior. For the record I do not think this is an issue for all men or that being masculine is problematic on its own.

You too. I like discussions like these, even if I feel like oftentimes nothing much is accomplished, at least we both leave, in the end, with a broader perspective. Fewer things interest me more than learning about things I find fascinating – and “gender politics” certainly falls in that category :-)

I think you’ll find that it is extremely off-putting to categorize sometimes very typical male behaviour as “toxic”, and it will not yield any positive results or feedback. You may not see it is an attack on men, but it absolutely looks like one, as a man. Why not talk about “breaking old-fashioned gender stereotypes” and “overcoming obstacles for the sake of men”. Make it something positive, to engage the people affected, rather than sticking a very negative label on them? This is being approached as if there is an inherent problem with being a man / being masculine, in how it is written, in my opinion.
>My understanding of damaging and unhealthy means that it would affect their well being and their quality of life. It affects how they navigate the relationships with people around them and the expectations they put on themselves and others. When you grow up in a world that has unhealthy expectations of what it means to me a man or woman you will be likely to develop not so great behaviors to try and accommodate those expectations. Everybody experiences it differently.

But again, these are extremely loosely defined terms. What is “toxic masculinity” to you and what is “toxic masculinity” to the next is not the same. Why not focus on the inherent physical and mental problems that arise, particularly for men because of tradition, and look at them objectively - as we do with everything else? Why do we need a gendered term to define negative traits? It’s the exact same with “manspreading”, “mansplaining” and whatever new-thing else. Everyone can be a jerk, sometimes, whether by filling up seats unnecessarily on the bus, or by explaining things in a condescending fashion. It’s isn’t just men doing it, yet we have gendered terms for it. It is complete lunacy. To combat negative behaviour, you need to get the people doing it, on your side, not push them away, and demonize them. To achieve change, you must want change.
>I agree that obesity should be treated as a serious illness and not celebrated. At the same time a person who is obese should still be able to celebrate other parts of themselves e.g personality, intelligence, humor, style, etc. But in terms of how it applies to toxic masculinity/ “the toxic idea of what it is to be a man” is that they don’t feel comfortable being open about it and just suppress a bunch of negative emotions. I’m not saying they need to be a gushing weepy willow about it but any negative emotion needs some kind of healthy outlet. Especially when it comes to self confidence. If you just let the idea of “I’m gross and nobody will love me” fester inside yourself it will not only hurt your mental well being but also taint how you approach relationships with others.

I know I’m not very “politically correct”, saying this... Again, I must stress: Everyone, regardless of how they look, should be as awesome as they possibly can be. That does not change the fact, that I feel people should be made aware of how damaging being overweight, obese or morbidly obese is to their body. That, and it how it should not surprise them that many people will not find them particularly physically appealing.

In other words: Yes and no.

Yes, they should celebrate everything about themselves (even their obesity, if they so desire), but no, I do not agree that they should not be encouraged to change - for their own sake! If you just re-affirm belief that “if someone loves me for me, they won’t care how I look” and make that a particular outlook, you’re setting yourself up for a lot of failure. None of this should ever be about other people; their acceptance or their lack of the same. It should be about making the most of the one life you have on earth. About not getting diabetes, about feeling good about yourself, about not getting a heart-attack or early-onset whatever disease. It is about being able to fuck for three hours straight without dying too to a shortage of air. It is about living life to its fullest and not selling yourself short. Most of all, a person should look to improve how they look for the sake of themselves. 
>Male friendship definitely takes a different form than female friendship. I can respect and appreciate that. What I attribute to toxic masculinity/the toxic idea of what it is to be a man is the rising male suicide rate and men being less likely to seek out professional help to work through those issues. You are now starting to see prominent male figures being more open and honest about their struggles with depression and mental illness and encouraging others to seek help as well. I do agree that women are much more likely to be open about their emotions but we are more encouraged to do so as we grow up. I wouldn’t say I cry/act unreliable/ switch moods every second nor do most women (but I’ve met plenty who do, just not the majority). But we just might have to agree to disagree on that point. As to whether or not that is toxic femininity I would say kinda? As unhelpful as that is. Toxic femininity is a whole more 10 paragraphs of text lol.

First of all: Of course most women are not what I described, just like most men are not what you’ve described. I reiterate: Instead of demonizing those who are, however, let’s approach it like an obstacle to overcome with them, rather than in spite of them :-) You also need to understand how many men struggle with their identity in these times. I remember writing a paper on this subject back in school, many years ago, and it is a much bigger issue today: Traditionally male virtues, acts and responsibilities are being “appropriated”(awful word) or “shared” by women, these days. Men who, before, found their identity in being the carer and responsible for the well-being of their families, having been raised to fill this role, are suddenly without a place in the world. What you describe as “toxic” parts of masculinity, in this aspect, were often counterbalanced by the less “toxic” part. A man was raised to be a man. Nowadays, a woman is raised to be a self-reliant and independent to a much bigger extent than she used to be, while the man is raised to either fill a function that doesn’t exist anymore, in the grand scheme, or to find his own way in a world where he is told he is the source of all things evil. A world where if he acts like a boy would “typically act”, he is doing something wrong. How feminine values, because they have taken ""positive masculine"" ones as their own, are suddenly the only good ones. They grow up confused, without knowing your place in the world.
>The reason toxic masculinity/”the toxic idea of what it is to be a man” applies to parenthood is because it hurts the men involved. It’s not about the behavior of the men involved. It’s about the cultural perception of what it is to be a man that negatively affects them. People do not expect to see a father take an active role in their child’s life so when a man does he gets pushback.

I earnestly cannot really comment on this except in a theoretical sense, as I am Danish and I do not see this issue here, often. “Housewives” don’t even really exist here. Everyones identity is closely tied to their jobs. Nobody, or at least the vast majority, prefer not to stay at home – regardless of their sex. Those who do, are equally judged by society at large, not because of their gender, which is mostly irrelevant, but because being unemployed is extremely taboo.
>I would also prefer that it not have to be divided up by gender but it's the reality of the world we live in. Men and women are different. They deal with different issues. It’s important we be able to use the language to identify individual problems with both experiences. Fixing this doesn’t fall solely on the shoulders of men. We all need to be involved in changing our societal expectations for both men and women.

Indeed – and look how we approached the emancipation of women: “Women are strong and powerful”, “Women can do anything men can do”, “Women are as independent and self-reliant as men”. That is how we change(d) the societal expectation of women. Exclusively positive. How are we attempting to change it for men? “Men are assailants and need to change”, “Men and masculinity is risky and something to hold in contempt”, “Male behaviour is significantly more dangerous than female behaviour”. We've even gotten to the speak, speaking of manspleaning and manspreading, that ""the way men speak, sit and act is untoward"". Exclusively negative.

It’s no wonder there’s pushback. Look at how the topic is being broached.

"I haven't had a look at foreveralone but my comment was strictly in relation to incel. The sub is toxic as fuck and a lot of the guys on there come across as terrifying future rapists/kidnappers.

I went through a dry spell of a couple of years in my late teens/early twenties so can sympathise, somewhat, with the feeling of loneliness that gradually grows into desperation. I also have a couple of friends who haven't had anything remotely approaching a long term girlfriend in the last fifteen years and I feel terrible for them. I know they want a relationship but, for no real reason that I can put my finger on, they're unsuccessful (though I'm increasingly certain at least one is going to come out as gay).

Now, I'm basing my next comment solely on the comment of yours I'm currently replying to. This may sound trite, unhelpful or a matter of ""well, it's easy to say that"" but...

> being with them makes me feel whole

In my own personal experience and the experiences of those I've observed, the above quote is going to stymie your desire for a relationship. Guys, girls, straight, gay - The best, most successful relationships I've seen seem to always be that way because the individuals don't need a partner to complete them. Rather, a partner complements them, personality-wise. I've seen it time again in my own relationships and those of my friends and co-workers. As you get older and move out of school/uni it's never easy to meet people who you can form a relationship with, either as friends or lovers; in fact it's atrociously hard and increasingly so. 

Out of curiousity (and please don't feel obliged to answer any of this) have you noticed that when you are in a relationship and ""feel whole, it makes me confident, it's great"" that the old adage of girls being interested in you when you're in a relationship holds true? And then when you're single that interest/attention seems to evaporate? 

I found that, as I hit my mid-twenties and became very comfortable in my own skin and increasingly didn't actually care what people thought of me, all of a sudden relationships (both short and long term) became far easier for me. I don't mean that I became an arsehole who didn't give a shit what other people thought but more that I became so comfortable with who I was and what I liked doing/reading/watching that I no longer avoided certain topics for fear of people thinking I was a nerd/weirdo/etc. I was comfortable enough with who I was that it was a matter of ""this is me.""

As I said, I hope that this hasn't come across as trite, condescending, easier said than done or whatever. I just think that if you can get to the point where you feel whole as a person without needing the validation of a relationship to feel as such, you may well be surprised by what comes your way. "

He doesn't come off as deserving special treatment, or that he's better than anyone else. I'll freely admit that he's perhaps a bit overly romantic and falls quickly and hard, but that's not ENTITLEMENT. And, as it turns out, the woman was completely innocent. LaForge is hardly the only officer investigating this, and encourages her to stay and face the trial, so I'd say having someone in the group who's defending her is probably a good idea.

It got out of hand a little bit, perhaps, but no one yells at Riker for having feelings for Minuet, which last much longer than Geordi's for holo-brahms.

>why does it even still exist in the database?

Because it's a diagnostic tool which literally helped save the enterprise from a slow and horrible death? Brahms quotes back the last thing we see holo-brahms say in Booby Trap, and her assumptions as to what Geordi was doing were just that; baseless assumptions. Assuming she just rolled it back directly, it suggests the program hadn't even been run between then and now. Geordi is mad at her for being a condescending jerk; arrogant, dismissive, and belligerent (the first thing she says to him is 'So you're the one who's fouled up my engine designs' and then walks right past him. On HIS SHIP). Both of them are in the wrong in various ways, and Geordi's the first one to admit it.

>I think his character was done a disservice in this way, but I'm not going to pretend that he wasn't often an entitled nice guy creep w lots of women just bc i like him and wish that weren't true. I stand by my criticism

Again, where does he feel entitled to any sort of relationship with any of these women? He's hopeful when he falls for them, and disappointed when they reject him. He doesn't get angry at anyone but himself, doesn't blame anyone for his romantic failures except himself, and all but flagellates himself when he screws up around women. HOW is that indicative of him feeling he is deserving of special treatment? 

I'll grant you creepy, insomuch as you can assign that any meaning whatsoever beyond completely subjective bias; plenty of studies have been done that show the difference between disgusting creep and alluring flirt can often be solely the physical attractiveness of the person making the statement."

>The recipient of a public scholarship is morally justified only so long as he regards it as restitution and opposes all forms of welfare statism.

>The same moral principles and considerations apply to the issue of accepting social security, unemployment insurance or other payments of that kind. It is obvious, in such cases, that a man receives his own money which was taken from him by force, directly and specifically, without his consent, against his own choice. Those who advocated such laws are morally guilty, since they assumed the “right” to force employers and unwilling co-workers. But the victims, who opposed such laws, have a clear right to any refund of their own money—and they would not advance the cause of freedom if they left their money, unclaimed, for the benefit of the welfare-state administration.

Yes. I did click the link, and I was angered by the author who seems to look with disdain on computer scientists, and people who bother to properly define ""regular language"" or ""regular expression"". I deleted a previous post I made, because I realized it was too filled with vitriol.

But I'll say it again here: The author is a moron. She doesn't seem to know much about the proper definition of ""regular language"", nor care. That kind of disdain for well-understood theory astonishes and angers me. I think a software developer should try his or her hardest to understand the theory that underlies their profession. This one writes condescending phrases like: 

>> So you might be surprised (or
disbelieving) to see a regular expression that does exactly that. The
explanation, of course, is that theory and practice are closer in
theory than in practice: Onigurama regular expressions, in common with
many other flavours, are more powerful than the things that computer
scientists call ""regular expressions""

Uhhh...... because they are not regular expression!! You have simply written a parser for a context-free language.

> What about Perl regular expressions? Where are they on the Chomsky hierarchy?

Perl 'expressions' are not regular. They fall firmly within Context-Sensitive languages, which is one step above even context-free languages. This is because they have backreferencing, which allows them to match the same full word twice. Context-free languages can match something like ""abccba"" ( a word and its reverse) but cannot match ""abcabc"", a word repeated twice, in general.

A proper regular grammar must be in this form:

 A -> BC
 A -> a

(Where `A`, `B`, `C`, are productions and `a` is a terminal). That's the actual, theoretical definition of a regular grammar. If you take an example like parenthesis matching, you can never fit into a grammar of that form. It is actually a good exercise to take common grammars of various kinds, like parenthesis matching in CFG:
 Expr -> ( B ) 
Try to put that in proper Regular Grammar form (each production's body is 2 other productions, or terminal). It's a good exercise.

To put in expression (rather than grammar) form, you get grouping and alternation (this|that) and Klein-star. The rest is syntactical sugar.

The last course I took before leaving college was the theory of computation, covering this stuff. I can show you some simple proofs and the basic theory (offline) if you are interested! I would caution you, though... because once you're learn it, you're condemned to see software developers the rest of your life misuse terms in the stupidest ways!

"> Mages are for haste. You can have them cast offensive or heal spells as well, but you need to set tactics up carefully, or they will run out of mana and cancel haste....which is bad.

I disagree... Mages are the most versatile class ingame and I suggest everyone plays through the game with one at least once. 

You have ofc the supporter that casts haste, but she (I usually use Wynne) can cast many other usefull spells inculding (group) heal, buffs, glyphs, and weapon effects. There is the controller, who casts hexes, debuffs, paralyze/stun spells, and who generally keeps the battlefield under control. This is a very fun character to play, but I usually use Morrigan for this role. It combines well with the final ""archtype"" for the mage, which is the damager, who focusses on dealing large amounts of damage, mostly through the elemental branch of the spells. The default tactics settings are plenty for a normal playthrough, but if you plan on playing harder difficulties I suggest simply making a mage character sometime.
(IMO some essential spells for all mages are heal, force field, and mind blast, which are all relatively low level. Haste is a higher level spell and requires spending 3 ability points.)

> Archery is awesome once you get (dammit I forget) Arrow of slaying (I think).

Archery is awesome long before that. I recommend a rogue as archer, you don't need the warrior qualities in order to do high damage and the rogue talents allow you to escape from trouble should you attract attention, which brings me to my second recommendation: keep your archer out of the battle at all times (like your mage!). Pay attention to where he/she is, and if the position is not optimal, move them. Also make sure they have the best equipment you can find. Make sure your archer is foccused on one target, preferably aiding your main damager or your tank (usually a warrior). Set this up in your tactics like: ""Enemy: Target of controlled character/other character"" > ""Attack"". 

You should invest in cunning for an archer since they are not supposed to need defense in the first place, and they make good utility characters. Raise STR to ~14, DEX to ~20, and CUN to ~30 (ignore the other stats). Then raise STR to ~20, DEX to ~30, and CUN to ~40. Continue to raise STR untill you meet the requirements for the highest level equipment, and spend all other points on CUN. As for abilities, assuming you're a rogue, get the lockpick skills as soon as you can, and most of the archery tree. Stealth is also good, if you attack from stealth you get a free critical, and it helps with scouting traps and enemies. The other rogue talents are decent as well, although they are more suited for a dual wielding character. As for specializations, go bard and ranger (or duelist).

> If you have a mage setup like this

Actually, mages are better off aiding a warrior. Usually you should set a damager (2h warrior, archer, dual wielder) with some anti-magic items/talents (templar!) to go after a mage.

I hope I don't sound condescending... I probably spend way too much time playing this game anyway. I did enjoy reading your post, it set me thinking. Ofc everyone has their personal strategy, and I could be wrong for all I know. The only way to find out what works for you is to try things out.

True. For example, so many times he's told others what to do or how to behave. He doesn't really tell you what to do but acts out in front of the others when you don't pay attention to him. It's like if I did something my way, and he didn't approve for some reason, and I completely ignore his condescending criticism, he would end up putting me down in front of the others or point out how wrong I am...

"It seems to me you take some liberty of interpretation here. On the one hand, you quote Romans 6 that the wages of sin is death, but you're commentary on that verse is, ""Sin is similar in that death (punishment) is owed to me after committing it."" I'm not sure if you noticed what you did here - you changed ""death"" to ""punishment."" That is an assumption of interpretation. In the Garden story, we are not told that death was punishment. I would argue it wasn't punishment, but consequences. If I say to you, ""Dude, don't eat that poison mushroom or you'll die,"" it does not therefore stand to reason that I punished you with death when you ate the poison mushroom. 

>God's wrath is vindictive.

So, it serves no remedial purpose? Is this at all the portrayal of the nature of God found in the person of Jesus? 

>The good thing is that God's vengeance is satisfied in Christs death on the cross that we can be at peace.

And so, once again, we come to the notion that God (and however you slice it - there is only One God [to refer back to the Trinity with which you began this comment]) takes out vengeance on himself. If a human were to behave in the same manner as you are describing God, he would certainly not be thought of as good. 

Suppose a king is implacable in his wrath, demanding in his justice to the exact penny, and unforgiving without complete and absolute restitution being made (which being done would not be forgiveness anyway, for satisfaction would have been made). Now, suppose that king, while recognizing the offending party's inability to make restitution, demands it anyway - as if there were some principle higher than himself which required it of him. So the king decides to pay the debt himself.

Now, this is what Anselm taught about soteriology. And it is bad enough. But PSA takes it an ugly step further and changes the word ""debt"" to ""punishment."" God doesn't pay the debt; God takes the punishment. His own punishment. The story becomes one of an unrelenting and demanding king who calls for death for anyone who breaks a single one of his laws (no matter whether it is high treason or a hungry urchin stealing a fig from his orchard) - ""off with their heads"" - one and all. But then, in a rather odd twist, the King himself condescends to die for the lawbreakers. He can't just commute the sentence, he has to be tortured and killed. Not because there is a higher principle than himself, but because it is the only way to satisfy his own anger. 

Really?


If you saw this happening with a human ruler, you wouldn't call him good, you would call him disturbed. And you wouldn't by any stretch of the imagination think to yourself, ""Wow, that guy sure is Christ like.""

Becoming ""white"" was considered the obviously desirable outcome.

The ""new"" idea is to rethink what the desired outcome is and to think of ""whiteness"" as one of many desired outcomes (which, in turn, subverts the entire concept of whiteness and diminishes its power, and this has made a lot of white people very angry)."

I should have specified that I was trying to point out that you only got part of the picture and I apologize that I conveyed a condescending tone. I concede that you were right about the release mechanism that Riddle, Hanson, and Fleckenstein described in the European Journal of Pharmacology in 2007 Link to the article.

Amphetamines, unlike cocaine and other psychostimulants, also prevent the reuptake of dopamine via DAT as explained in PLoS Biology.

So yes amphetamines stimulate the release of DA and block the reuptake but they also inhibit the breakdown via MAO as stated in your source:

""Amphetamine may also act as a direct agonist on central 5-HT receptors and may inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO)."" 

The pharmacology of this was originally described by Clarke, Miller, and Shore in 1979 here.

MAO is the reuptake enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of dopamine (as well as epi and norepi).

There's literally people from the US coming over here to campaign about our politics.

">When someone has a pension that invests in corporations are they then bourgeoisie?

Strictly speaking yes. However I don't think they are what socialists view as the problem per se. Obviously no matter how society is organized there will be those such as the old who need to be cared for. In socialism, capitalism or any other system. In capitalism it is just done in a risky way that utilizes the workers exploitation (this may be a topic we have to discuss) without their choice or direct acknowledgement.

>I don't recall Marx describing the bourgeoisie as you do.

I don't mean to sound condescending, but this is how he typically uses it, as well as how socialists use it. In Capital, the Communist Manifesto, etc, he uses capitalist and bourgeoisie more or less interchangeably. This is how socialists use the word to this day. I will explain more down further.

>""1 : middle class; also plural in construction : members of the middle class 2 : a social order dominated by bourgeois ""

Yes, that is how it was originally used and defined. However, when used by socialists it is meant to mean capitalists or the capitalist class. Capitalts are basically those who own capital. Capital meaning means of production, machines, money, or commodities depending on the stage in which the utilization of capital is at. This is something we may need to discuss. Class is an interesting topic really. Classical political economists used to, and Marxists still do define class not by wealth (although one must acknowledge the correlation between wealth and class) but by a persons relation with the means of production. You can own them, work on them, or a mix. So ""middle class"" really has no meaning in Marxist terminology as it is an idea based on wealth. When thinking in Marxist terms, there are three classes:

1) proletariats

2) petty bourgeoisie

3)bourgeoisie

I can explain further if you want me to.

> ""Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat."" Karl Marx 

I don't know why you added this, as it seems to prove my point. The epoch of the bourgeoisie is characterized by the simple antagonistic relationship between proletariats and the bourgeoisie, or, workers and capitalists, or exploited and exoloiters, or propertied and propertyless.

property referring to productive property- ie factories, farms, machines, etc.

You're right, it sounded more condescending than I intended. There's no outrage, though - I really just meant I'm surprised.

>Women can still be scum even if they hardly ever rape and men rape all the time.

Absolutely. I have no particular interest in making women out as rapists. I don't really care. The thing is I've grown up believing a lot of these feminist statistics, because we're all bombarded with them, told to accept them as indisputable fact and attacked if we dare to doubt them. I did once believe men were violent and women weren't, that women made less than men, that DV was almost always male on female and that rape was something only men did, etc. But when you look at the evidence and the least biased surveys and statistics we have, almost all of those ""facts"" turn out to be pure fabrication.

In the case of rape, the seemingly least biased numbers we have show that it's not a male thing. Women do it as well, and perhaps even in comparable numbers.

There's a pretty well known (in these circles) report by the CDC going around in these threads: 
 http 

This report is trying very hard to make it sound like women don't rape, by defining rape as penetration only. But if you read between the lines, specifically the ""forced to penetrate"" numbers, they show something entirely different.

">Hmm probably a little controversial to say, but is it really that different from fetishising any other (non-""race"" based) group? For example bear, twinks, jocks, femms, mascs, chubs, gingers etc. 

You're close, but you missed one important detail. Take for example, Pornography. Most Porn sites will feature ""fetish"" categories that include specific categories such as the ones you listed; bears, twinks, etc. You will also find other categories such as ""asian, black, latino,"" etc listed in the fetish category. Not only does this imply that certain races/ethnicities are reduced to sexual fetishes, but it also implies that Pornography is tailored to a white male audience, since ""caucasian"" is not listed as a fetish among the other categories. This technically means that certain ethnicities/races are stripped of their cultural identity, in order to entertain the white-male demographic. The ""fetishes"" that you listed are tailored to merely physical traits (since Asians, Latinos and Black people can also be bears, twinks, etc) but the need to specify their race in the first place using labels such as ""interracial"" implies that they are being reduced to sex objects - not just for their sexual acts, but for their race. 

This similar narrative can be applied to dating in general; the need to reduce a person's race/cultural identity to a personal preference (or ""fetish"") does carry racist connotations. No, you're not being intentionally racist, because it's not like you're actively going out of your way to be discriminatory, bigoted or condescending towards any individual because of their race. But nonetheless, it is still racist, because you opt to reduce their race to the same level of desirable/undesirable physical traits, rather than perceive their race as a part of who they are. It is an unconscious form of racism, since you're not actively aware of it. 

And if I truly believe what I just told you, then that makes me a racist by my own words, since I openly admit I don't find most Asian men attractive. However, I don't list that as a preference, but rather a silly and unnecessary filter that will ultimately do more harm than good. That being said, this does not make you a bad person, but it is something you should be aware of. "

>rape culture, 


You mean of boys being raped by older women or male prisoners?

>and women not being taken seriously. 

As what?


I've heard ""as a mother"" taken seriously. As a father, not so much.

Men get longer sentences, are vastly more likely to die at work, on the streets, of a drug overdose, or suicide, they're less likely to graduate highschool due to well known bias against them by female teachers, and make up only 2/5ths of college students. They live shorter lives and get less public health funding (even after accounting for pregnancy).


There are laws that openly discriminate against them (VAWA, Duluth model, selective service, etc). 

Men are the majority of prisoners and homeless.

When a boy is raped by a woman he's told he's lucky. When a male prisoners is raped by another prisoner he's told he deserved it. This pretty much never happens for girls and women in the west.

If feminism were fighting to get rid of these male privileges they'd be fighting for equality.


Instead they seem fine with all that and prefer to focus on manspreading and mansplaining.

">Should we also be up in arms because Peyton Manning likes shitty pizza?

"> Why are you employing the exact same tactics and faulty rhetoric as the people you are disparaging for using those same tactics and rhetoric?

Because I hold the left to a higher standard than the rhetoric they've been using the last year which has gradually become more angry, condescending and vitriolic. The left is pushing these progressive policies and changes in American culture on people who were not ready for it and had no basis for these changes to begin with. The rural community is out of mainstream American culture, is incredibly less diverse, uneducated, poorer and riddled with drug addiction. They're ignorant and lack the perspective gained from more diverse, progressive communities. This is what the left needs to understand and fails to do time and time again. Instead of showing a willingness to discuss these issues, they simply become hysterical that anyone could have these viewpoints to begin with, as their reasoning seems so obvious to them. How could they be so hateful of the LGBT community? Didn't they go to a diverse, liberal college where they were exposed to these issues first hand? Weren't they friends with people growing up that later came out as gay/bi/trans? Don't they have friends who are a part of a minority group? No. They've lived in white america their entire lives. That is the only thing they know. They're lives are markedly different from the typical liberal. It's not as if they shared similar experiences and chose to continue living lives of ignorance and prejudice. They're victims of circumstance, just as black youth in poor, urban communities are victims of circumstance. How come we can so easily accept the latter but refuse to even acknowledge the former? Because they're white? They're a larger demographic? Their ignorance is off putting and confusing?

The left needs to take a deep breath. The left needs to be the first to swallow their pride and open a discussion, and more importantly needs to be prepared for the other side to spit in their face. Change doesn't happen overnight and it doesn't come easily. Trump has muddied the waters of political discourse and the left took the bait. But having an emotional reaction to the views of the right and stooping to their level, engaging in violence, using emotionally charged insults only equals the playing field for backwards views. It only fuels the fire of conflict. Now the right's embrace of white nationalism seems just as rational as the left's embrace of diversity and identity politics. Both are having rallies turn violent. Both are calling the other side nazis and racists and fascists and both sides think they are right. Does the left really think this is the best way to establish change? To reach a shared level of understanding? To bring back the humanity of both sides lost in the eyes of the other due to this tribal mentality? To open lines of communication? The argument of ""well the right does it too!"" is simply a denial of responsibility. The left is supposedly the progressive, educated, level-headed ideology. Well it's time they started acting like it. 

You clearly disagree, but I think social media platforms are a good litmus test for the waters of discussion. The least likely to listen may be the loudest, but the only reason they are the loudest is because the base is propping them up. Every now and then when an LGBT issue is at the forefront of public discussion, I see a large handful of my facebook friends posting statuses saying ""If you think LGBT don't deserve the right to their body/serve in the military/etc. please unfriend me"" which usually ends up getting a lot of likes and support in the comments. What I don't see is people commenting ""I appreciate the intent but this is only making discussion of this issue more polarizing"". In the cases I have, they are quickly shouted down as [insert insult of the week] and their opinions dismissed. I've had numerous people unfriend me on FB for simply sharing an article explaining why we shouldn't use violence even against nazi's and pointing out how it's hypocritical to criticize Trump for using the MOB on a terrorist tunnel network while not saying a word while Obama was handing out drone strikes like candy. These people may not be the majority, but they are driving the conversation. The left is the group protesting speakers from the right and denying them a platform to share their opinion on multiple occasions. Now who is really being stubborn and narrow-minded? It's time the left started calling out it's own hypocrisy.

> Do you believe that a person is not able to see that 10,000 people ""liked"" a ""trump is racist"" meme and understand that while trump might not literally want ever single black person to be subjugated or killed, trump did indeed form a large part of his political platform on toxic discourse and racial resentment?

Sure, this could be easily argued but do you honestly think this is a constructive way to have a conversation? Does this get us anywhere or acknowledge a complexity to these issues? Can't you see the irony in condemning generalizations of minorities (""all blacks are criminals"") while actively taking part in the ridicule and generalization of the opposing party (""if you voted for Trump you're a piece of shit"" ""anyone who supports trump is a racist"" actual statuses I've seen on facebook that received high praise)? They are both lazy oversimplifications of complex issues. Your whole argument seems to boil down ""yeah but look at them"" and condoning the use of language that does nothing but villainize opposing views and further entrenches everyone in their beliefs without actually saying why this is helping the issue. Since when has ""they started it"" ever been a valid argument?"
"For some reason this comment is detached from the thread, Reddit must be having a bad hair day. 

>Alright, fine, I'll insert the Greek.

I guess my point wasn't clear. 

My point is that the context determines the meaning of the action.

If I were to bow down before you, it could mean I was trying to worship you, or it could mean that I was show you a great deal of honor and respect. 

It could mean one, or the other, or both. 

If someone does proskyneo before anyone other than God, then we must assume either (1) they are wrongly worshiping something that is not God, or (2) they are trying to show great honor and respect. 

The words though are identical. 

In the Hebrew scriptures, this act of bowing was extremely common. 

People bowed this way before King Saul (1 Sam 24:8)

...before the high priests (1 Sam 2:36)

...before prophets (2 Kings 2:15)

...before persons of authority (Ruth 2:8-10)

...before older relatives (Gen 48:11-12)

...before angels (Gen 19:1-2)

In none of these examples was there any sense of religious worship. 

Jehovah had completely forbidden anyone to bow down in a religious way to any other god. (Ex 34:14)

So, at Matthew 2:11, and Matthew 28:9 when people fell down to the ground before Jesus, it was not worship, it was just another example of showing high honor and great respect in an acceptable Jewish fashion. 

This can also be seen in another example in Revelation 3:9

""Look! I will give those from the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews, and yet they are not but are lying—look! I will make them come and do obeisance (proskyneo) before your feet and make them know I have loved you."" (Rev 3:9)

Are these ones from the synagogue of Satan worship the Christians? No, they are only bowing before them in honor and respect, not worship. 

So, all bowing must conform to the rest of the scriptures. 

Bowing, or prostrating the body, before anyone other than God is only as a means to show honor and respect, not worship. 

So, although it says that they proskyneo to God and to Jesus, it must have different meanings. 

>The same is true of Revelation 22:13. The Alpha and Omega who is speaking is the one who is coming quickly in verse 12, and that is Jesus. It's not difficult to conclude, it's easy.

As I said, I disagree. 

>And what's with all the condescension?

Sorry, didn't mean to be condescending.

>we call people ""my righthand man,"" but that's clearly not what Jehovah has in mind

In the Old Testament the role of Jesus was not always clearly highlighted, in fact we did not even know about Jesus at all until the New Testament came along. 

Looking for examples that Jesus is God is the Old Testament is going to be fraught with very selective interpretation. 

Every time you ask ""Same nature?"" you're implying. 

Why are you implying? Because the Bible doesn't actually say it.

>We can agree that Jesus was not just a prophet. Prophets spoke words of God at certain times, but their every word was not God's word. Jesus is different, he claims that every single word out of his mouth is God's word, how can that be if they don't share a nature? If Jesus's every word was just a mouthpiece from Jehovah, and everything he did was dictated by Jehovah, then Jesus was a puppet and has no personality at all! Yet we affirm that Jesus has personality, so when he says ""I do not speak of my own originality"" he must mean a cooperative effort between himself and Jehovah. And if that's the case, how can his every word and action be God's word and action AND Jesus's word and action unless they share a nature?

The prophets of old were all sinners, and none of them had a pre-human existence in which they shared life with God in heaven for billions, trillions, untold ages of time, absorbing every detail of his personality, all in heavenly perfection. 

So, Jesus obviously is going to be infinitely better than any ordinary sinful human prophet ever could be. 

Let's say for a moment you were perfect, absolutely sinless.

Let's say you lived in heaven with God.

Let's say you loved God more than anything else, and above all set his will as your absolute highest standard.

Now, lets say that you had untold ages of time to do nothing other than bask in the glory of God, and do his will, and imitate his fine example. 

This is who Jesus is, this is why God loves Jesus more than anyone else, and why Jesus loves God more than anyone else. 

So it is not hard to imagine that God would send Jesus to earth to teach us the truth about God, and to be a perfect example of God for us. 

But that doesn't prove the Trinity.

">Nah

I was playing off the fact that you were insinuating I am a /r/donald shill.

>Your strategy of repeating Comet's testimony is simply to have a lot of bad sounding words attached to Clinton.

No. I am highlighting the severity of the situation.

>To make a careless IT mistake is not the same as being a careless person.

I get your point. I disagree, I think your using of Clinton's campaign as an example is insufficient, not to mention this is the second time she's had to run for president. If she couldn't get it right this time against a socialist atheist Jew with the entire head of the DNC against him, well, fuck lol.

I think her lack of judgement shown in the creation of a private email server in her home, in choosing to lie nonstop regarding these emails, in her vote for Iraq and then her push for intervention and an attempt to establish a failed democracy in Libya, in her lack of attempt to unify the Democratic party by at least not being condescending to Bernie voters, and in her hiring of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz is a recurring theme. 

I don't think Secretary Clinton has the best judgement.

In addition, I think that there is not a small probability that Secretary Clinton built that email server to prevent her emails from being accessed through FOIA. Huma Abedin's emails to her warning her when their communications were going to be publicly accessed are extremely suspicious. They clearly knew what they were doing. Yes, I agree with James Comey's recommendation. It is certainly not enough evidence to indict Clinton. It is not, however, unquestionable.

>But why aren't the nearly three hundred people she was in contact with, who should have known better, investigated by the FBI? Why is Clinton so singled out here?

They were. Of course the focus of the investigation was Clinton herself, as it was her private email server in her home, and it was her State Department.

>And, do you really believe this IT mistake is equal to or greater than dishonoring our vets?

You seem to keep thinking I am somehow comparing this to Trump's Khan incident, or that I am making the argument to vote for Trump. I am not. Secretary Clinton has faults. Faults that should be discussed and should not simply be dismissed as ""an IT mistake"". Trump has faults which are splayed out in the media every day for us to see. I see no need for me to discuss these faults. Everyone already knows what they are."

The scary thing is that this ignorant attitude was probably shared by Hillary herself. It explains the condescending, incompetent and idiotic way she tried to reach out to Millennials. But too many understand it was the young she promised to send into war and condemned to die in climate disasters because she never found the courage to stand up to the oil industry. They saw that Obama campaigned on ending two wars while Hillary promised to expand war while praising Henry Kissinger. Obama thankfully ignored Hillary when she foolishly advised him to be more militarily aggressive on several occasions.

The claim that people become conservative as they age is a popular myth. A majority of boomers were always conservative, self-serving voters. A majority of people under 30 voted for Nixon over McGovern. Boomers voted for Reagan when many were still young, then Bush and now Trump. 

Boomers are a uniquely destructive voting force in American history. They inherited the great New Deal economy from their parents and voted for a series of Presidents (including Bill Clinton) who dismantled it for their children. They deserve to have their kids living back at home. And now even Democratic boomers consider climate change to be a backburner issue not worth dramatic action or political courage. They voted to condemn their children to poverty and their grandchildren to miserable death and destruction in climate disasters. The majority of boomers are the most damaging, self-serving, idiotic asshole voting block in world history. "

">The celebrated cooger has come near entirely from female media. Meanwhile an older man with a twenty year old is a pariah in society.

Literally my point. Women celebrate older women snagging younger men. Men celebrate older men snagging younger women. Imagine for a second, if Hillary Clinton was on her 3rd marriage to a man half her age, admitted to grabbing dudes cocks whenever she felt like it and sneaking into younger men's dressing rooms for lolz. We make infinitely more passes for male sexuality, even when it's gross.

>If women had no abortion rights they would be equal with men.

No. Just no. Just because men have no biological equivalent to this, doesn't mean you get to reduce women's bodily autonomy to less than that of a corpse. Equality is both genders having total control of their bodily functions, not just the one's they share. Most women don't ejaculate, congratulations, the govt just regulated ejaculation. You can only do it once a fortnight, for procreation's sake. You also have no rights to your Adam's Apple, and can be forced at any time to donate it to science.

>Women have more birth control rights and options.

It is also nowhere near as widely accessible as male birth control.

>This is a myth

No it isn't, and I'm not going to argue something that's been debated countless times, and always come to the same conclusion.

>The men they are married to share their wages with them. Men take less out of the tax system than they put in. Its the opposite for women, so large sums of money are transferred to women from men via the state and relationships. So women have more access to resources.

Lemme guess, you're one of the 'housework isn't real work' crowd. Women claim more welfare because they're typically poorer, this only enforces the undeniable fact that the wage gap exists. Plus, if married women get a share of their husband's wages, then their husband's should get an equal share of their welfare, and therefore there is no welfare gap.

>The lesbian premium research shows women are paid more when they work as much as men.

Link? I'm interested.

>Women are the majority of voters so they have more political representation. 

They get to pick between one misogynist and another. Not the same thing. 

>They get a much easier ride when they run for office

Is this why one of the most qualified women lost to the least qualified male presidential candidate of all time? How many senators or congressmen are actually congresswomen. How many female heads of state in the western world?

>Women control 80% consumer spending so the media is slanted towords women.

Yet it seems these companies are unwilling to listen to their consumers. 80% of consumer spending is a broad term, I'm talking about movies and TV here.

>Society excuses womens rapes, not the other way around.

'But he's a good kid', 'Why ruin his career over one mistake', 'She was a slut anyway'

>Rape of men is barely spoken about the numbers arent widely collected or reported.

There is not a single credible statistic that has men as victims of rape more than women. And not one that shows women commit rape at anything like the rate men do. 

>Men and women got the vote at around the same time.

Men were denied it because of wealth. Women were denied it because they were women.

>Men invented this for women, and paid for it. Women tend to object to recriprocal rights for men.

I don't see why men inventing it is relevant, given how women were barred from professional careers even more so then than now. What reciprocal rights do womeb object to?

>Women are more aggressive in this regard.

False. Women are murdered, raped, abused, and assaulted by men far more than the opposite.

>Disrespecting a woman is blasphomy in this culture.

Which is why Mr 'Grab 'Em By The Pussy' is the leader of the free world. We treat women more like children than equals, we either abuse or pedestalise then. Any woman in a professional career will tell you they have to work twice as hard and shout twice as loud. Not to mention the assumption that they're just gonna have kids and leave, the idea that some women take their career seriously is foreign to many (male) employers. Also, as much as the term is abused now, there is a reason the term mansplaining was invented.

>So women have more rights than men in this regard. In most countries a woman cannot be charged with rape at all.

Rape meaning penetration. I don't agree with this definition, and I along with many other feminists want it changed. Either way, a woman can be charged with serious sexual assault, which up until recently, a married man couldn't. And the law doesn't say a man cannot be raped, just that a woman can't commit rape."
"> That's good. It sounds less to me like he's unsure about how sexuality works than he's trying to justify his behavior and objectify you.

That's creepy and fucked up shit to say in any relationship, especially one as unbalanced as this. I'm glad that some of the worst case scenarios are less likely, but he's still sending up about 500 red flags for being dangerous and abusive.

I'll be careful and if I think he's getting abusive then I'll tell my mom or one of our other friends.

They aren't always right, but they're almost always worth listening to.

We had a really bad fight when I came out because she was being so condescending. I was literally shaking because I was so scared to tell her I was gay and she laughed at me when I tried to explain that I didn't feel that way until recently.

I really worry about her judging me or being ashamed if she finds out that I'm having sex. I know I'm out of the closet but I don't want her to know that I've been getting anal, or that it was unprotected. I think I'd want to die of embarrassment if she ever knew.

> It's also ok to be upset. Even if this is an unhealthy relationship, you still have feelings. It's a difficult situation that's going to make you feel difficult things. The important distinction is that just because you feel something, it doesn't make it true. The fact that you care for this guy doesn't mean that he hasn't hurt and taken advantage of you, and it certainly doesn't mean you owe him your body or your silence.

Why didn't Cloud just JUMP up to Shinra tower on disc one instead of climbing up the support structures. Why didn't he JUMP out of the Gold Saucer Prison? In fact, being able to jump THAT high, why didn't he just JUMP everywhere? 

Problem is, FF7 as a game was already inconsistent to begin with, the huge divide between the gameplay and the narrative is what holds the whole thing together. It's the dam that holds back the flood of plot holes. Otherwise, everything falls apart when you start to ask questions such as why characters are able to perform certain feats in gameplay, but not within story. The FF7:AC film, does use a lot of the gameplay elements, so I understand the confusion.
 
In this case, let's say FF7:AC should be consistent with the story of FF7 and not gameplay. Fair enough, but this means that canonically, within the Narrative of FF7, Cloud defeated Sephiroth in a one-on-one fight, using Omni Slash. If we were to impose consistency on the narrative of FF7, restricting the characters entirely to what they had been able to do from story alone. Then there is no conceivable way in which Cloud should have won against Sephiroth and that feat was entirely based on Plot Armour. 

Personally, I choose to believe that Cloud was as strong as what he was shown to be able to do in game, as exaggerated as it was. I believe that there is an extent to which we should accept the inconsistency as maybe operating within the laws of the narrative's universe, and maybe the plot holes are more to do with character's motivation to choose to not Jump Good as opposed to their actual capability of jumping good. Sure, it reduces the fallibility of the narrative. But it also justifies why Cloud never jumped everywhere, not cause he couldn't, but because he simply chose not to until then. And Sephiroth losing to Cloud despite being waaay more powerful than him was simply cause chose not to go all out for whatever reason. My guess is, cause Sephiroth is an arrogant S.O.B.

I mean, it's either that, or acknowledging the inconsistencies for what they are. Flat out inconsistencies that would otherwise break the narrative.

As for game centric things like Knights of the Round, or Meteor or the ancillary items... I'll just ignore them until they're proven to be canon.

>Right, which is why you don't try to. When you do, as I mentioned earlier, that's called pandering and it takes away from the story. I wouldn't have had a problem with them touching on the characters. I personally just feel the way they did it was over the top. In honesty, I would have MUCH rather they had found a way to work those characters into the story itself much more than I would prefer they cut them. But having them show up for 2 minutes all at once just in time to stop Sephiroth was just too much for me.

Yeah, but the movie itself was already pandering to the FF7 fanbase to begin with. That and the whole compilation of FF7 as a whole exists for that purpose. It's fan service. I think there's nothing inherently wrong with pandering to fans. As long as, just like you said, it doesn't away from the story. 

But my question is, how did the appearance of Cloud's old party take away from the story?

Because from my pov, they actually reinforced it in a lot of ways, their presence helped reinvigorate Cloud's old self and fighting spirit, as well as helping him defeat Bahamut Sin. Which was a crucial plot point. Them showing up when Cloud began to realise the importance of not being scared to accept help, really hit the point home. Which was a key theme. The Power of Friendship. Cause these are Cloud's actual friends.

>They all did play important roles in the game. Not in this film. In fact the only main characters who had any real relevence were Cloud, Tifa, Aerith and to an extent Vincent. 

This is a bit much. If the cast was reduced to just those characters, considering the origin of FF7, it would have been far too empty to just omit everyone that wasn't carrying the plot. The side characters were worked well enough into the story that they didn't detract from the main plot point during their appearances. Which was helping defeat Bahamut and providing emotional support for Cloud who was depressed. They were an important enough presence to contribute to Cloud's character development, but not so obtrusive that they completely took away his spotlight. All in all, I appreciated their cameo. But I think you may treating their appearance a little too harshly. Again, I understand that you had expectations which weren't met, and I empathise with that. But it's not like their cameo damaged the overall film in any capacity. They simply didn't show up for as long as you had hoped they would.

>Exactly. The Medium MATTERS.

Indeed, but in this particular case, I'm referring to the length of the run time, as opposed to how game mechanics would canonically translate on screen.

>Not to sound like a dick, but just to clarify, I hold Final Fantasy VII up in my view as one of the greatest works of fiction ever created for multiple reason. I've spent hours reading analyses of the story and characters. I can tell you I 100% grasp the nature of Final Fantasy 7 as a story.

I apologise, that was very condescending of me to say. 

>Clearly you are as passionate about this game as I am. Let's agree that the game itself kicks a ton of ass.

Definitely. All aboard the Midgar hype train.

>On a side note, out of all the Final Fantasy games, VII is the most grounded and realistic, relatively speaking, I think. Which is one of the reasons it's so successful.

Nah... FFX or gtfo. Lol. But for real, I think the success of 7 was thanks to a lot of things including the huge success of the PSOne as a console being revolutionary as a gaming platform. But that's an excuse for a discussion for another day."
">You lack the ability to try to see the other persons perspective.

Of course that's the case. When you don't actually make an argument for yourself, the person you're talking to has no reason to change their opinion- that's how arguments or debates work.

>you'll just tell me that it's irrelevant or point to some other evidence that supports your ideas and say that trumps mine.

That's definitely a possibility- again, kind of how arguments work. It's fine if that kind of thing is an automatic turn-off for you then fine, but it makes it kind of hard to take it seriously when you guys claim to be all about logic and reason.

>You're telling me that if the things I said were true, I'd be quoting you.

Yes. Again, if you have a point like that, it's pretty easy to support with evidence.

Again, you need to follow this sort of thing up with a quote if you want to be taken seriously. Every time I have one of these conversations it's the same story- like you think that if the other person isn't agreeing with you, they're close-minded. No, that just means your argument is shit."

Making bold and unsupported claims doesn't merit a response. But I'll point out the holes if you want to try to fill them in:

> If we don't frack then we have to use more coal. Right now those are the only two options available. 

Source?

> We can order [everyone's AC] turned off (and deal with that problem), burn coal (and continue to kill with that smoke as well as kill mining it as well as cause AGW), or we can frack and burn natural gas which is better for the air.

Source? 

I pointed out your false dichotomy, you chose to ignore it. Ironic given your continued claims that I'm not replying to you substantively.

> As for long term Bernie is anti-nuclear which is a far worse policy than her interim fracking stance.

This is completely irrelevant, but at least gives a lot of insight on why you're so testy about someone raising a calm objection to your homegurl- gotta fight the persecution of the berniebots, those evil fuckers!

If you want to try to support those positions, great (hint: the Heartland Institute isn't a valid source) and I'll be happy to knock 'em down. But if you're going to make a low-effort argument, you aren't deserving of a meticulous and thorough answer. Moving on..

> You sure are sensitive. You gave out at least 10 insults and attacks. What set you off? Near as I can tell your problem was questions you were unable to answer.

Is this revisionist history, intentional naivety, or what? My initial comment was directed at someone else and was not angry or douchey in the slightest. I called out the cute, unprovoked, misplaced arrogance because you're the epitome of what's wrong with political discourse in this county. 'I'm a fucking genius, I'm infallible, anyone who holds a different view is necessarily dumber than me and therefore beneath me'. Nah. You're just another over-confident partisan that would rather insult others than partake in a level-headed discussion and entertain the ideas of others as equal. That obscene lack of maturity is what gives liberals a bad name, and why people equate us with endless condescension. You are toxic to the political process in the country, and deserve to be called out as such.

> And that makes it bad why? How about instead of repeating the situation you actually explain?

You know, I'll concede that this is a logical failure in the argument I made here, touche. I should have separated the two. I want to know what was in those speeches for their content alone. You're right, the content will not reveal whether or not there was an exchange of money for favors, and that will only be ascertained with time. Admitting fault, fucking nuts right?

> Says the guy who insulted over and over because someone was ""uncivil"" to him.

Again, I couldn't care less how much you talk shit to me. I insulted you because I see you as one of the biggest impediments to reversing the unnecessary polarization of American politics. When I type out a calm, respectful response to someone (who isn't even you) and some halfwit comes along to insult my intelligence for holding a different opinion? I don't care that you disagree with me. I care that you share a lot of my ideals, and that people will rightfully be turned off to those ideals once you present them the way you seem to present everything. You can make all the petty attempts to belittle me you want. But stop making liberals look like insufferably condescending pieces of shit, for the rest of us if not for yourself.

>Parental rights are important because they enable diverse forms of social organisation, culture and beliefs to co-exist and reproduce themselves (and occasionally extinct themselves). 

There are two possible interpretations of your logic when taken to this extreme, and neither are tenable:

1. Diversity is inherently a good thing (agree), and any attempts to restrict it are bad for society as a whole (disagree). That viewpoint is ironically quite condescending towards the people whose autonomy you supposedly respect. ""Oh, how blessed are we to share our world with this strange exotic culture, where it's okay to passively allow a child to die so as to not use offensive technology/knowledge. Aren't we fortunate!""

2. Diversity is a good thing, and any attempts to abridge it are dangerous - therefore, we must allow through certain toxic perspectives for the greater good of freedom of thought, for any attempt of restriction causes more harm than it prevents. This is ""better"", but still is quite myopic, for it ignores other principles foundational for modern society, such as everyone being entitled to at least a shot of a happy life. Imposing one's viewpoints on another at their peril is easily bannable without any grievous cost to diversity at large, and is a move that well defends the other aforementioned tenet of freedom, so it's pretty clearly evident as an overall beneficial move.

You need to wake up here. You are not a deep thinker who is making difficult but necessary choices out of some broader perspective. You are simply so incarcerated in inanity you can't see plainly obvious truths. I hope you never come near a child, because you are nowhere near competent to care for another's life."

">What is the point of this subreddit or any discussion if there's no such thing as a ""good"" or ""bad"" movie?

Your mistake is your premise that the purpose or inevitable result of a discussion forum is about reaching consensus. It's not. It's about sharing information, ideas and insights that can mutually benefit the members of that forum by enriching their lives. It's not a political discussion that demands a solution. It's a discussion of art and entertainment, and the day we all decide there can or should be only one approach to these things is the day we kill them both. 

Taking offense or condescending to someone because of what they like is pointless, and strangely enough originates with the human need for connection. It's not so much that we arbitrarily demand that people like what we do, it's that we feel an impulse, a deep desire for connection, and a shared understanding of art or pop culture is a kind of litmus test for that connection; it tells us that we are made of the same stuff, and we use it as a codex for a shorthand that strengthens that connection. Surely you realize that's what Reddit is? Why people beat memes to death. There's a little jolt of pleasure we experience with the inside joke. 

Well, art appreciation is a ""higher"" form of this, if you'll allow. And so we want people to like what we do because it simultaneously validates our self-image and forms a bond with a fellow human. But there's no need for uniformity of opinion. It's not even desirable, if you ask me. Just as there could be no joy without sorrow, perhaps we couldn't appreciate a masterpiece like 2001 as much, if people didn't exist who enjoy Tyler Perry or Larry the Cable guy movies. And as condescending as that might sound to fans of the latter two, I don't mean it as an insult. I mean that different people like different things, because of our personal experiences.

">/r/TrueChristian is great. Whereas /r/Christianity is a place to discuss Christianity, /r/TrueChristian is a community for Christians.

From a non-Christian and non-atheist perspective, that's what those subs are on their official heading and what they'd like to be, but not how /r/TrueChristianity or /r/Christian are in practice.

/r/Christianity is more the community for Christians. Reason being is that I see a lot of non-discussion threads that'd be considered completely rude and disruptive in a discussion setting, and these threads are very successful. Headings like, ""Praise the LORD!"" or ""Jesus is LORD!"" with content like, ""He is!"" and upvotes for miles. Meanwhile regular discussion comments can be harshly criticized (not discussed) and censored by vote manipulation. Here is one where I was downvoted 18 times, passive-aggressively harassed, accused (""why you mad, bro?"" provoking with Christian overtones), and the like for saying that I didn't understand why martyrdom was righteous and why that was. That didn't contribute to the discussion in the opinion of readers, because the discussion isn't the subject of martyrdom, but how Christian norms are great.

Also there have been occasions where I was surprised with mod action, because I was mistaken for an atheist, taken out of context, and shaken down for ""disrespecting Christianity"" (basically, not advocating it, or for viewing it from an historic lens as a faith). I usually just ignore this as par for the course because to say that /r/Christianity isn't experienced how the mods and Christians think it is (probably thanks to regular ""as an atheist"" vanity threads), I understand that I'll probably be banned if I challenge the family myth and get branded a trouble maker for stating a forbidden opinion. I've been threatened here for less, so I generally keep it to myself and let folks believe what they want about themselves and their communities.

But this isn't a place to a forum to discuss Christianity. Discussions happen, but they're tightly regulated by several tiers of influence starting at the community level and escalating to moderation and expulsion. 

You can either be neutral (generally speaking, as there are times you can't as the mods/users will add tone based on their spiritual insecurity), or advocate Christianity. If you're not ""respectful"" to the subject matter, you're out. That's not a place of discussion, that's a community.

On the other hand, /r/TrueChristian is just a silly place where some Christians go to say things they can't get away with anywhere else, and treat people like they can't anywhere else. /r/Christianity has some bullying elements, the most annoying aspect being the attempts to spiritualize it and condescend, but /r/TrueChristian really is just an echo chamber."

Yeah, if the premise is assumed to be true. If you assume the premise that it rains meatballs from the sky at night to be true then the conclusion that it is wise to stand outside with a bowl is valid as well.

>Nationalism and states cause major military conflicts, not individuals or corporations. In the absence of a state, there would be no nationalism, so two major contributors to war would be eliminated.

Nationalism is a new idea, coming from the early 1800's. How could ancapism abolish nations or nationality permanently? Also, wars existed long before states and nationalism. Tribal warfare was one of the leading causes of pre-agricultural death. That's anthropology 101.

I'm not gonna bother with the rest, I don't care and I can't change your mind most likely, but I'll address this.

>you just have implicit bias against ancaps.

Yes. There is no feasible long-term way of not having a state as long as capitalism exists. Disputes of property must be settled by some sort of power with access to violence. 

If you can't accept a state must exist to arbitrate disputes and protect private property, then I cannot debate with you because denying that fact and trying to explain how everything wouldn't be absolutely awful without long extremely complex explanations on how people would always behave in certain situations that don't necessitate a state simply has a level of understanding of how societies and people function that I can't breach. If you can accept the necessity of a state then discussion is possible because you have some sort of understanding of reality and how people function. I can't tell if ancaps simply don't know enough history or sociology or anthropology or any combination of those, but they just don't know what they're talking about and they must realize it on their own. Is that demeaning and condescending? Yeah. Can the same be said by others of communist positions? Definitely. 

For instance, your post simply lacks an understanding of what parents do and what people have done in history. Not all parents particularly care about their kids future. For most of history, children were born to be farmhands. Parents in poverty want their kids to work ASAP to add income to the household. It's not because they're bad, it's because they need money. That's not an opinion, that's fact. When Mexican immigrants take their kids out of free school to go pick strawberries, they're doing so because they have to. "

And that is why I call it ""The Emperor has no clothes"". As we can see, this white privilege, unearned success is nonsense. We should be promoting higher privileges for all, not condemning it.

>When conservatives have this epiphany, they're becoming the people you dismiss when you make a blanket statement about white progressive hypocrisy: white people who try not to be racist and try to be aware of racism.


I'm not saying this at all. All I am saying is don't call yourself an ""ally"" and conservatives the ""enemy"" of minorities. If someone politicizes an issue requires all people to buy in, they clearly are not interested in solving a problem. White progressives are quick to politicize racsim, and they have prevented progress by censoring and holding a monopoly on the conversation regarding racism. ""Racist"" has been used as a political attack so many times between 2016 and 2017, I don't think the word has any meaning anymore.


White progressive elites don't care about minorities. Most them will never even interact with a working class immigrant their entire lives. What they care about is power. Otherwise, democrats and the like would make a concerted at improving their lives. 


One of the things I like about leaders like MLK and Reagan Reagan is how they tapped into the spirits and dreams of the people. These leaders provided something no welfare program ever can, and that is a vision and belief that mankind is meant to control its destiny, not to be victims of the system. Slaves and prisoners are given food, housing, and healthcare--and this is exactly what progressives want to give to the people they claim to want to help. Immigrants and natural born minorities have dreams--there is no quicker way to crush their dreams than to indoctrinate them into believing they are victims of the system and they will never succeed because of ""white"" privilege.

I don't know, I've always looked at those one-line insults as kind of revealing in themselves...if you don't know how to properly articulate your thoughts/arguments to a person, you're probably more likely to stoop to easy, childish insults.

Yeah, society can improve a lot now that magic is involved. I wasn't aware of the rules, I thought we were being realistic in this discussion. That's why I went with just treatment and an unbiased court system. I didn't know we were allowed to cast an honesty spell on everyone.

First of all, stop acting like asserting something confidently will make it automatically true. I know you're probably a lot younger than me so I'll try not to condescend too much... but I'm ""absolutely"" not going to be phased by your confident demeanor. I actually know the meanings of words, you can't bullshit me. 

Second, revenge can be just, and justice can indeed be vengeful. So sorry, but you're once again incorrect. 

Third, I didn't say ""revenge"". I said ""punishment"". You said revenge, probably in an attempt to slander and divert the discussion. Courts don't seek revenge, because the court is never the victim of the crime. If you murdered a judge's daughter, then that judge won't preside over your case. This is done specifically to deter against vengeance-seeking, by the way.

Uh, I just gave you a bunch of examples of it being effective. Besides BASIC COMMON SENSE. If someone is behind three concrete walls... can they rape a woman? No. There's not even an argument here. You're trying to say that locking up someone literally doesn't keep them away from everyone else when obviously it does. Prisons exist. If it didn't work, everyone would just be on house arrest. Let's not be stupid and keep arguing over whether humans can pass through concrete walls like ghosts. 

>most criminals are encouraged by jail time to commit more crime.

Might be true but that's not what you said. You tried to call me out on the claim that prisons don't keep prisoners away from other people. And you failed miserably. You should have just brought up other counterpoints like this in the first place. 

And that's why low-level criminals are usually allowed to stay out of jail. Because of the criminal tendencies that will grow on them. That's why we usually keep prison reserved for serious offenders.

No, literally millions. Because again, people inside can't get outside. So anyone who can't pass through cement but would like to murder again but is in prison, is essentially stopped. Pretty basic stuff.

No. The only game stated to be in a world different from oras is rse. Nothing about the others, therefore the others(except gen 7) are in the same world as both. The franchise always worked this way.

> Any time the games with Mega Evolution have referenced events that we know went down in the other regions. 

This proves the events in the other regions that we saw in those games happened in the world with mega evolutions. It proves my point.

>Point is, the fact that these details, which happened in the games before the whole Megaverse stuff came in, are being mentioned in the games after the Megaverse stuff came in, means that the Megaverse still experienced those events in a similar way.

It means those games also happened in worlds with megas. You arbitrarily decided that these events can't be the same based on absolutely nothing. You just adjusted the facts to your theory.

...Because whether it's a necessity or not is a red herring. Food is a human right and the government doesn't have the right to restrict individual access to it regardless of what it is. When governments violate that right (which they do, let's be honest) people like me complain because it's our job. If no one complains and if everyone adopts the flippant condescending attitude toward those who would be most unduly influenced by stuff like soda taxes like you have, that gives the government leeway to essentially do whatever it is they want.

this Wikipedia article is a good start. If you google ""special relativity for beginners"" you can find many other resources that take different approaches to explain the same thing. It's kind of hard to wrap your head around, as it seems to violate common sense, but it's been experimentally verified many times. 

> Here's another question. Let's take a star that's 7 parsecs away from Earth. WISE 0855–0714 will do - it's 7.2 but we'll round down for the sake of discussion. By your reasoning that would mean that if I could travel there at 0.99 lightspeed, then I would feel it to take a year and my sensors would indicate that only a year had passed since I left.
> But in point of fact, (assuming stationary stars for simplicity's sake) I am traveling the entire distance from Earth to the the Star, am I not?
> So, the time dilation effects the man traveling at high velocity and he is actually traveling 7 light years but perceives it as one year? My question is - given that the distance doesn't change, what happens to the distance in the equation? Is the fabric of the Universe contracted so 7 lightyears gets contracted into 1?

A parsec is actually 3.26 light years, and the last thing we need is another unit of measurement, so lets stick to a hypothetical star 7 light years from earth. From the perspective of the man in the spaceship, yes, the entire universe looks foreshortened while he's moving at .99c.

> Or are you saying that the man will not hit the brakes until 7 years of Earth time is up - as time in his local reference point is happening much more slowly? (That would actually make sense.) 

That's how it would appear from Earth. The ship moved near lightspeed for 7 years, covering almost 7 light years.
 
>But if he's traveling to WISE 0855-0714, he'll still need to cover that distance and he will travel for 7 years at 0.99 and go 7 parsecs and the star's position is still 7 years from Earth. So, then will he need fuel for the 7 parsecs or only one?

I have to get pedantic for a second, only to avoid creating a misunderstanding. We've been talking as if this spaceship has some sort of drive that takes it instantly from 0 to .99c when turned on. This violates all kinds of physics, but it simplifies the discussion of relativity. In reality, the ship would need to use fuel to accelerate to .99c, and then to slow down again. In between, it could switch off its engines and coast at .99c for as long as it wanted, consuming no fuel whatsoever. If we're going to postulate that our magical engine doesn't work like that, but instead moves the spaceship from rest (with respect to Earth) to .99c as soon as its turned on, then consumes a constant amount of fuel until it's turned off, returning the spaceship to rest, then yes, it would need 1 years worth of fuel to run the ship for 1 year as measured aboard ship. To someone on earth, the engine would be seen to use fuel 1/7th as fast, but for 7 times longer.

When the engine was turned off, the astronaut would be just under 7 light years from his starting point, and 7 years would have passed on Earth during his trip.

">They're less likely to be arrested

>Not that I disagree that there can be advantages to being white, but it always blows my mind that the same people using these facts to discuss white privilege are so quick to dismiss them and scream that there is no female privilege.

I think that being a man/woman both have advantages and disadvantages today. Historically speaking, it really sucked to be a female. You're weaker, you cannot defend yourself against most men, you have menstrual cycles, you were denied education, you were forced into marriage, your husband could beat you and there was basically nothing you could do about it, you were not allowed to work (or if you were you were not allowed to do the same things as men). You get pregnant and can't continue working while men don't have to worry about that.

Like I've said in other replies, a lot of this has to do with history. I'll admit that in modern western places, women are a lot better off that in history, and most of the male privilege has been corrected against. The wage gap has shrunk to an almost statistic anomaly. But some stuff still exists, like women being less likely to be promoted to higher positions. 

Men definitely have disadvantages too, I don't think anyone is arguing against that. Men generally are expected to earn money, and are expected to do most of the work when it comes to finding a partner.

I think both sides should come together and recognize that both sides have advantages and disadvantages, the thing is that mostly one or both sides will be extremely condescending and think it's a competition over who deserves more slack. A lot of this probably has to do with the fact that men sort of ""handwave"" history away like women have been able to enjoy all the privileges they have today for hundreds of years- in reality women basically just got all the same privileges as men a few decades ago."
"> Fun fact: every taxpayer in Canada has money taken out of their paycheque, sent to the Federal Government and distributed as a transfer to a province which may or may not be their own (often not) for services they may or may not use.

Let me make this abundantly, extremely and totally clear, so that we can try to put a stop to the condescending cries of 'BUT ALBERTA DOESN'T PAY TAXES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT' that gets trotted out every time equalization comes up. I am aware that the money goes directly from my paycheque the federal government, and doesn't take a stop at the province in between, as do most Albertans. It is an irrelevant semantics point that you guys constantly bring up. We know. It makes absolutely no difference whether a group of people who collectively live in Alberta and pay taxes to the federal government pay more taxes to the federal government than they receive back in Federal spending, or whether the province of Alberta collects money from Alberta taxpayers, remits the money to the federal government, and then recieves less back in transfers. I am the taxpayer, and to me, it makes absolutely no difference, so please, stop bringing up this irrelevant argument.

> This is part of being a taxpayer and part of being in Confederation.

And part of our confederation is also the ability to have free movement of goods without having to pay ransoms or tariffs to other provinces, and also the exclusive power of parliament over interprovincial infrastructure, and here we are. 

>But if your complaint is going to be that ""I don't like money coming off my paycheque,""

I don't like money coming off of my paycheque and being transferred to the people demanding ransoms from Alberta and preventing our goods from getting to market. There is a difference. I'm quite happy to share in the good times - as Alberta has and continues to do through the taxes paid to the federal government by our individuals and corporations and through the billions of dollars every year of income earned in Alberta that gets spent in the economies of BC, Ontario, Quebec and the maritimes by FIFO workers. In return, I'd like to get the product to market.

"> So let's assume for arguments sake that feminists don't acknowledge an empathy gap. We should now ask ourselves why it's important that the narrative be that ""feminists don't"" instead of ""society ought to""? Or perhaps asked a different way would be to ask why it is that feminists not acknowledging it is the fundamentally important part of addressing the issue?

This is actually trivially easy to answer. In at least the realm of gender politics Feminists and Traditionalists hold the most power. 

Traditionalists want to go back to when there was even less care for men as individuals and where women as a group might have had more empathy at time it was an impersonal and condescending type of empathy. So trying to get these people to accept the empathy gap would be futile, even if they accepted it likely they would think it acceptable or unalterable. 

Feminists on the other hand are ostensibly about caring about equality and while I do not think this is universally true of every feminist I do think it might be possible to reason with some and perhaps shame others into accepting this.

The vast majority of people do not have the voice to matter so while it would be great to convince the mass of voiceless people if we can convince those who already have a voice in gender politics they can convince far more people than we alone could. And to be honest even if we can only get Feminists to rail against the idea it's getting more people aware of the issue than would have known about it before."
"> this idiotic idea that rape is somehow different from other crime

It is. I won't go into detail because I've never been raped, but I've heard to many women who have been assaulted to imagine how it feels like: not being safe in your own body. Feeling it's not yours. Losing all trust in your loved ones (because the vast majority of rapists were close to their victims before they aggress them) and in all men, and women because women shame victims, too. It's an horrible, horrible crime that can really be life-ruining. It's not for nothing that rape survivors are called that way.

>that the targets are being ""blamed"" if they are told they should take precautions.

How is not blamong the victims to say if they hadn't dressed that way, walked that late by themselves, smiled at that man, they wouldn't have been raped? It is blaming them, and saying that men couldn't somehow control themselves.

>I shouldn't have to lock my doors at night, but if I left them open and I get robbed? That was stupid of me. It doesn't make the person who robbed me any less of a horrible person... but I could still have protected myself better. And even if I do everything right.. I can still get robbed. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't practice basic home security.

WOMEN ARE NOT HOUSES. Damn, how is that difficult to understand? A man who decides to rape a woman isn't robbing a house, he's violently assaulting another human being and maybe ruining her life, as I said above. Being raped is nothing like having your house robbed!

And how do you suggest women protect themselves? We're not taliking about locking a door when you're away. We're talking about women being told that if they smile at, look at, or dance with strangers, they're taking risks. At that point, everything is ""taking risks"". She shouldn't be alone, as she couldn't defend herself. She shouldn't be with people, as they could rape her. She should walk in the bad parts of the city. But most rapes happen indoors, so she shouldn't stay home either. She shouldn't smile if she doesn't want more, but give us a smile, honey! So what do you suggest to women on how they could defend themselves? Pepperspray? Learn how to fight back? very easy against a man who's 20 or 40 kilos heavier, who made sure you couldn't escape, who took you by surprise or who's threatening to kill you or humiliate you further.

>Yes, there should be a lot of effort to prevent rapists from assaulting people. But there are bad people in this world and pretending their isn't is stupid.

You're saying that like rapists are some kind of rare, horrible monsters who have nothing in common with you or me. Rapists are men (or women, but mostly men) like any other, and they rape women like any others. You may know a rapist or two, or three or four, or more. I hang out mostly with women, and I know way too many who have been assaulted by men. If you hang out with men, you must know assaulters.

>The fact is, there are men out there who prey on women in clubs. Women should be aware of how to minimise the risk of becoming a victim, not shun the idea because they ""shouldn't need to"".

Oh please, mansplain me how I should protect myself. I'd love to hear that.

>Basically, don't be so naive that you confuse the world we live in with the one you wish we lived in.

You're being really condescendant on that one. I know my bit about the world I live in, thank you. I also know that the world I wish to live in is very different, but I know that it's possible. At least I'm trying to et educated and work on it."

>I'm only nineteen

You're only nineteen. I've been nineteen, it's been thirteen years since I was nineteen, but I remember being that age and I know that at that age one isn't generally receptive to advice from older people but I'll try anyway. 

If I had made lifelong decisions based on who I was and what I thought at nineteen, I'd probably regret them now. 

I'm speaking from the viewpoint of someone who has dealt with anxiety and a developmental disorder my entire life, with close family members who have dealt with lifelong depression, just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from. 

>I tried accepting my body for years with no results except for a deeper voice and body hair. I'm not going to rattle off my whole life story, but suffice it to say that I don't consider acceptance bad, just not a realistic option for me or people like me.

I don't want to sound condescending but, you're only nineteen. You haven't come anywhere close to figuring yourself out yet. 

Also body hair and deep voices, plenty of women have those things, wanting to be a woman (I presume) may just be a focal point for something else, some ideal woman are thought to represent. 

>I would love to be convinced that none of this is necessary, but nothing that I've heard seems to indicate that I'm wrong.

"> I think you should be, but the reality is, people suck, so instead of having this unattainable goal here's a more realistic implementation to balance people in proper games.

But why? You just admitted that you can't properly balance games in this system if not everyone is playing their best role. It's one thing to try and be competent at all 5 roles, but why on Earth would you deliberately try and be perfectly equally competent at all 5 roles? What's the point?

""Ah, shit, been getting too good at ADC this past week of spamming this fun new ADC, time to take some time off from Kai'Sa to practice the other 4 roles until I catch up to my ADC skill again, or my ADC skill degrades back down to the level of my other roles"".

Trying to maintain a perfectly equal skill in all roles sounds like the most pointless and biggest waste of time I've ever heard. I don't even like top lane, why would I try and maintain my skill in that role when I barely ever get it? I like mid, adc and support, but not as much as jungle, so why would I go out of my way to maintain a perfectly equal level of skill in those roles when the system is happily going to place me jungle in 90% of my games anyway?

Most people enjoy the game the most by playing only one role, and if you ask any high Elo player the one best tip for climbing you'll hear ""stick to as few roles and champions as possible"".

I don't understand why every time a topic like this comes up these people come out of the woodwork with ""A true League of Legends player plays every role well to climb"". Most people don't want or have to play every role, why would you force them to? It's such a pointless and condescending ideal to try to force onto other people, I don't get it. Can't you just accept not everyone likes to play the game the same way you do?"

 If you really wanted an answer to that question, then you should have actually gone to the lecture about exactly that instead of blocking the entrance to it.

>Men have dominated EVERYTHING for hundreds of years

Let's unpack that a bit, shall we? Until recently, it was royalty who dominated everything. Most men didn't dominate anything because they were peasants...or soldiers sent to the meat-grinder if they were lucky. So really, when you say shit like this, you're pointing to the people at the very top and saying those that shared inherent characteristics with them (e.g. gender) ""dominated"". Men were nobility and, as nobility, they controlled everything. Therefore men controlled everything. But you're forgetting that women were nobility too...like Queen Elizabeth I.

As we moved towards a more equal society, different types of people began to gain power. It's not like all men had power and then suddenly women got power. Do you think the white slave-owning woman had less power than her black slaves? And don't even try to claim said women were simply exercising their husband's power. There were plenty of women who owned plantations and the slaves therein outright.

>Why should men be allowed to perpetuate rape culture? 

Outlining the problems facing men and discussing ways to fix said problems has nothing to do with rape. Furthermore, ""rape culture"" (like ""patriarchy"") is just a conceptual lens through which one may see the world. It's an unfalsifiable explanation for phenomena based on ideology, not some undeniable and proven theory. Until you can prove that it's the only correct explanation, you will just have to accept that other people may see the world differently. What you call ""rape culture"", they might call ""egoism"", or ""the devil"", or whatever. Unless you can rule out the other explanations, it's fucking ridiculous to expect them to give up their rights in deference to your unfalsifiable hypothesis.

So you ask ""why should men be allowed to perpetuate rape culture?"" And to that I say: one's right to speech should not be infringed upon based solely on an irrelevant and unfalsifiable hypothesis. To me, the question is akin to asking ""why should J.K. Rowling be allowed to perpetuate Satanism?"".

"Lol, ignore the sources and respond only to the parts you can. You are basically displaying willful ignorance through confirmation bias at this point.

>But that's not cross-cultural at all - you'd have to make some argument for why maths scores in some countries are at parity and not so in others.

I'd love to see some statistics indicating where they are at parity. Math grades pre-college often tend to be similar, because the material is simple and women are basically given grade boosts for good conduct (not to mention the well-established fact that men mature after women do). I've yet to see equal scores on any tests of problem-solving ability/math aptitude in any location. International math and science olympiad participants are almost wholly male from every country.

>This breaks down your argument a bit, since maths majors have been closer to gneder parity than physics majors

Oh, wow. It's almost as though women comprise 76% of school teachers (that is, math education majors, who do not have to take even the most difficult undergraduate math classes) -- and that the gender parity does not at all continue to the PhD level.

>And this is just about all I need to know about you. Typical undergrad physics major thinks bio and chem is all memorization - there's even a relevant XKCD that I'm too lazy to find. Ooooh you've taken undergraduate organic chemistry, you're totally an expert on the field.

Haha, I would love to know what you do for a living. And in my case, it isn't ""typical undergrad physics major,"" it's ""typical guy who scored a 2400 on the SAT, was valedictorian of a top high school with minimal effort, and will finish 4 years of free college with a master's in physics before entering medical school."" I wouldn't be nearly so condescending if I were a ""typical"" physics major ;)

It's funny: I've also shadowed and talked to several doctors (including 2 researchers who work in my desired field of medicine), who have basically told me physics is more difficult than what they do. 

Note how you didn't actually respond to my completely valid explanation, or the fact that the data I linked supports it -- you simply tried to attack the source as a means to reassure yourself.

>Lol - arguing neuroscience points by pushing soft social science papers.

What? I don't even. The point is that men are even handicapped sometimes throughout the first 12 grades, yet they still have such an innate advantage in math and physics that it isn't enough. It also explains why women are beginning to outpace men in less mathematical sciences. Your ""arguments"" are so bad it's hard to fathom a proper response.

>also you keep posting the grey matter/white matter thing but you clearly don't understand the research behind it, especially the part about how despite the statistical differences between male and female brains they arrive at the same performance which is what astounded the researchers in the study in question.

">Calling out a party for being sexist, is not itself sexist

I didn't say it was. I said creating a negative term that refers specifically to members of a particular gender and associates a negative behavior with them (that is not exclusive to them or ubiquitous among them) is sexist.

>and this particular brand is culturally ingrained and reinforced among men (ingrained and reinforced in them by women as well as men).

I'm not sure I agree. I would agree that perhaps male superiority is reinforced in some contexts, but I don't think being condescending is reinforced. I think anyone who is condescending is an asshole, and I think most people agree with that.

>I maintain that the somewhat comedic and light way that it calls a sexist premise into question as the reasoning for condescension is of value. A form of social progress through humor/satire and it's strength to effect appropriate shamming.

I agree that satire and humor are both of value, and I can even see that value in a term like this, but I think there is too much potential for abuse. The reason being, it's really just a conversation ender, like ""check your privilege"". There is nothing logical in it; it's simply an accusation of someone having a particular stance or motivation - one which you couldn't possibly determine without them explicitly stating it.

So if someone is trying to make an argument to someone who isn't grasping their point, an accusation of ""mansplaining"" fully derails and negates any point they were going to make. The fact that it's a gendered insult means it is capable of silencing and delegitimizing male voices. I'm not cool with that (not cool with silencing any group), personally.

I also think it's of little value in that even if someone is sexist, that doesn't negate any point they were making. That's an ad hominem attack, and it has no place in a rational discussion. The proper response is not to fling an accusation, but to logically defeat their argument. 

Calling out ""mansplaining"" uses someone's gender (and motives) to determine the soundness of what they are saying, which is the exact problem it claims to call out."

Some friendly advice form someone who spent a number of years as a web-admin/moderator for a midsized forum, I offer this not to be condescending, but just for any intellectual benefit it may have for you (and my feelings won't be hurt if you ignore me).

1. Do not take things personally, ever. Keep thick skin, don't feel the need to respond ad absurdum, especially to trolls. Confidence plays a big role in this. The fact you were arguing with some guy for an hour and finally threatened while hurling invectives him means you are not confident, and taking things personally. Just state the facts clearly and let it go, as a mod you have power, don't let yourself get antagonized.

2. Don't confuse confidence with a power high. Power highs are bad. I'm not saying you are power high, but if one doesn't follow rule number one, one tends to go over to the dark side.

Have fun and thanks for being a mod!"
"> I don't believe that they'll give the inspectors uninhibited access for any reasonable amount of time. This is based on past behavior.

Iran's ""past behavior"" has been excellent. Iran has been far more open, accommodating and cooperative with the IAEA than, say, the US has ever been.

> My issue is, what is the difficulty of temporarily suspending enrichment for the chance of greater rewards

Iran did temporarily suspend its enrichment and granted the IAEA full, unimpeded access to the entire country. In exchange for this show of good faith, the US manhandled the IAEA into a highly contentious vote to refer Iran to the Security Council, even though Iran was doing absolutely nothing wrong. 

The 'offer of assistance' extended to Iran was for Iran to cease permanently its uranium enrichment and become dependent on the nuclear 'have' nations to supply it with uranium. This, of course, would entirely defeat Iran's goal of energy independence once its oil supplies run down, and places the power right back in the hands of the global hegemon.

> The schtick with the British sailors may have boosted their standings in the Middle East for the short term; but the majority of the Western world sees it as unpredictable behavior.

Only those people who don't know what happened will come to this conclusion. The British soldiers were in disputed Iranian waters and they were spying on Iran - and this after a long history of provocations. Nevertheless, they were treated well and released after negotiations with Britain. Even a former British ambassador argues that Iran was within its rights. 

Can you imagine the response if an Iranian ship were in British waters spying on Britain, or in American waters spying on the US? 

> As for ""raising"" the level of discussion, I was not the one who initially demonstrated hubris. That lay entirely within your realm. If you want to have an adult discussion, perhaps next time you can disregard your contempt for those you feel are ""sheeple"" and lack your cognizance of world affairs.

So when you decide someone's demonstrating ""hubris"", you're justified to call them a ""condescending prick""? A real ""adult discussion"" is a discussion in which people restrain themselves from throwing around schoolyard insults when their facts and reasoning are disputed (and for the record, I'm not aware that I've ever called anyone a ""sheeple"" - I think the term is idiotic).

The fact of the matter is that you trotted out a straightforward falsehood that is being promulgated relentlessly by the American government and the mainstream media but easily checked. I called you on this and it pissed you off. 

For what it's worth, I believe anyone who is willing to make a reasonable effort can figure out what's going on in most world affairs. My perspective on Iran is by no means unique or even particularly insightful.

>Never had a dog with maggots, or dry skin, or flaking skin...nothing. The worst health problem we ever had was a dog with floppy ears who was constantly getting fungal issues...because of baths. We always tried to keep his head as dry as possible, but shit happens.

It would make sense if it got fungal problems in that said environment. Shit happens man. Health isn't an arithmetic problem, there's variables that can come into play that you can't always control.

Oh boy, I think I might love you for this comment alone. I went on a tirade about this on r/sailormoon because someone bitched that there weren't enough gay-male relationships anymore. 

Its just pandering, I don't know how other minority people don't find it condescending as all-get-out. For instance I'm a girl, but I don't want a female Doctor if the script is crap. It would feel really patronizing ""Look what we did just for you. Its a Doctor with b00bs!"" Don't get me wrong, most shows need to have more deserve characters, but its the difference between Modern Family and the couple of episodes where Phil has a black neighbor/friend and shows like Scrubs, Grey's Anatomy, or New Girl. One is obvious minority pandering and the others have a pretty much seamlessly formed diverse casts (Grey's Anatomy will every once an awhile have a ""push the envelope"" character that they parade around)."
">a hate group that wants to drive women out of games.

Imagine for a moment you're at a party (maybe you're not the social type, but bear with me). You're hanging out with your friends, having a good time. Then a bunch of new people suddenly walk in, uninvited. These are people who used to make fun of you and look down on you before, but now they want to come to your party, so you let them in.

Now this new group wants to take over the place. They start making fun of you, telling you what you're doing is stupid and wrong, and that everything should be done the way they want, in order to please them. So you and your friends tell them to buzz off.

So what do they do? They run crying to the whole community with stories about how ""hateful"" and ""harassing"" you were, and that you need to be stopped. Then they launch a relentless campaign of mocking and harassing you and your friends, while claiming that you are doing it to them. They get their buddies in the media to support them and paint you as the villains, while they are poor innocent victims. If you try to defend yourself or explain your side of the story, you get ridiculed and shut down with terms like ""mansplaining"" and ""sea lioning"". The media (who is friends with their group) won't even listen to you. Anything you say is used as ""proof"" that you're wrong.

And that is GamerGate."

"> Let's say governments around the world start cutting funding for science and denying the existence of man-made climate change (oh, wait...) Would that be science's problem? 

Yes. Whether or not it should be is another story, but science has accepted the problem and spends time and money on it. You don't get to choose the problems society needs your field to work on, unless your field won't produce anything either way. Then I suppose you do get to choose because it doesn't matter.

We figured out the answer, and we told everybody they're dumber than us, when they didn't listen we condescended even harder, there's nothing more we can do! Society should provide servants for us to spread our message because we can't be bothered to leave our armchairs.

It's amazing to see how philosophers are so quick to take credit for everything science does but you look at the glut of lawyers running around and suddenly law is a field that has nothing to do with philosophy. Philosophy has 10x the claim to law than it does science, but since science is popular you spend 10x as much time trying to be associated with science.

> All we're saying is that philosophy is not totally worthless, but notice that we don't then attack science for being totally worthless, or somehow worth less than philosophy. You, however, aren't happy with people acknowledging how great science is. You have to then attack other disciplines for not doing things that it's not their job to do.

If science wasn't tackling the problems society needed it to tackle I'd call them out on it, too. Not only is philosophy failing to get much of anything done philosophers demand to be viewed as the ultimate intellectuals.

I don't attack philosophy to make science look better because it doesn't need it. If you think philosophers don't attack scientists look at the title of the thread."

Trans people have feelings, too. You're basically claiming that they aren't entitled to an emotional reaction to things that are extremely rude and condescending. Maybe cis people should just accept that sometimes we'll piss trans people off, it's going to happen, and we should accept it.

 He defends his points very badly. If someone questions him, he just tells them they didn't understand and they missed the point. He rarely explains himself well.

 Insulting. He does this in every single review and most of his comments. There is no need to call people things like SAOtards.

 His way is the only way. According to him, you can't enjoy a show without taking apart it's themes and storytelling and if they did them good.

So sure, he sometimes has some great points. People would pay more attention if he was not so condescending. People can derive enjoyment from things outside the ""deep themes and storytelling"", despite his beliefs. Honestly, if he didn't just shit over half the community on a consistent basis people might pay more attention to him. It's not that people are not ready for the truth.

"It's hard to debate this topic while remaining respectful, so I feel it necessary to state that I do believe that the Israeli occupation is a massive civil rights violation, and I am disappointed frequently by Israel's actions, it is very easy to get carried away anti-Israel, and I'd like to try to prepare some coherent and agreeable counter-arguments. I don't demand that you believe all of them, but hope that you consider some of them.

> Why jews could not treat muslims who lived there from hundreds of years the same way those muslims were treating them for centuries all over israel?

I don't mean to be condescending, but I want you to realize that your premise is faulty. I don't say this to mock you or to denigrate Arabs, but leading up to the 40's their was violent and substantial Arab resistance to Jewish immigration. I'm not even saying it wasn't justified; just that while Arabs didn't mind (and probably for the most part didn't notice) small Jewish populations during the Ottoman years, they were not happy about the waves of Jewish immigration that had occurred starting at the end of the 19th century, which were continually spurred by pogroms in Russia and growing anti-Semitism in Europe. I also don't mean to suggest it was one-sided; some Zionists committed acts of what would be considered now terrorism in opposition to British limits on immigration.

Long story short, the UN passed a partition plan in 1947 allowing for an Israeli state and a Palestinian state. You can argue motives or the justification, but the problem is that both Jews and Arabs were between a rock and a hard place. Arabs had the majority there for more or less hundreds of years, but Jews had nowhere else to go. Jews celebrated and accepted the two-state plan, Arabs were pissed.

The partition plan in retrospect wasn't that terrible; Mahmoud Abbas has said Arab rejection of it was a mistake. It gave land to Jews primarily where they already were in addition to desert in the south, gave Palestinians control of most of the land around Jerusalem (although Jerusalem was supposed to be neutral). This is not to say no Palestinians would have been displaced, but the magnitude of the displacement was directly due to Arab refusal to accept this partition plan, which eventually resulted in the Arab Israeli War of 1948, and Israel winning significantly more land than had been originally planned (including parts of Jerusalem, although I'm sure you already know that there has been a continual Muslim presence and habitation of many Jerusalem neighborhoods).

It wasn't a matter of Britain, or the US, for that matter (which didn't play a role in the foundation of Israel... I'd be curious to hear what makes you say ""US-backed imperialistic forces""), saying ""all right Arabs, time to scram;"" it was a matter of Britain saying ""time to share"" and Arabs saying ""fuck no.""

I would agree that Arabs were put in an unfair situation, but they pretty clearly made things worse, and when given the chance have tended to double down on this demonstrably bad decision.

The circumstances of Arab migration from Palestine is up for debate; Arabs say they were driven away, Jews say they refused to be governed by Jews. In either case, it wouldn't have been nearly as severe if the plan had been accepted.

conclusion I think a lot of these comments are fair and spot on, but trying to parse through this history is tough. At the end of the day, really all parties should be focused on what is the path to lasting peace in the region, and while I don't think the answer has changed in the last 80 years, I hope the involved parties have and will continue to do so."

Do you have a copy of the exact results? Specifically I am looking to see if it's a ""sensitive"" or ""ECLIA"" or ""LC/MS-MS"" result. The range seems like a sensitive test, but your spelling of E2 seems to imply you're in a country where the sensitive test doesn't exist. There's a huge difference in the results.

In correct. They aren't mimicking a culture, they are mimicking a ""person"". In this case, the singular person from the video in which spawned this ""meme"", who did in fact sound that way.

>The characters poke fun at what they think Ugandan culture involves then stereotyping it.

They aren't doing that. They are referencing a ""singular"" person, not a culture.

>If you can't see how it is extremely offensive and racist then you have an issue with seeing things from a different point of view.

No, you have issues with thinking everything in the world, and everyone in it is set out to be this way. And that isn't the case.

You would have an argument if the people were referencing an entire culture and believed that culture to be below them. You would have an argument if the people were doing it in a condescending way (such as when a bullied person cries, and the bully makes the crying sound after). None of this is true.

It is a reference to a singular video, about a singular person (who btw, we dont know was or wasn't really from there) and was made into a gag about this person and the video. You are taking it to the extreme, putting it into a context it wasn't actually in, making it about something it isn't, and then calling it racist because you have a flawed view of things. If I fattened by lower lip, talked with a slight slur and referenced shrimp and an impersonation. Im not implying all black people are this way. Im simply pretending to be Buba from forest gump. That isn't racist.

The Minstrel Show reference you are making is actually quite different. Because in the show, they imply that the blacks were lesser people, dub-witted and foolish. They implied that ""all"" were this way as well. Your comparison to is is just as flawed as your way of thinking, which is why you are trying to imply racisim. They are two vastly different scenarios. None of this is true for this scenario about the meme.

Again, you are simply confusing racism to stereotyping. At most, the people are ignorant. Most are doing it solely for comedic effect, which, is an alright thing to do."
"> If you look at the note, the start is very ""wavy"", either meant to disguise the handwriting, or the result of high amounts of adrenaline.

But we have no idea who wrote it. It could be an intruder's everyday penmanship or a parent writing it in a deceptive style.

Also, the length of the note is long championed on here as ""proof"" the Ramsey's wrote it. Other kidnappings have had longer notes. Also the ""3 pages long"" narrative is oft pointed too by the RDI side. However remember this was not written on an A4 size piece of paper that comes out of the Xerox machine or printer.

The RN was written on a note pad, designed to fit in a lady's purse. It was about the size of a postcard. Visualize that and it becomes different. 

Was it long? Yes

Is it odd? Very

Is it ""proof"" that any one person was the author? No

Whomever wrote that note either is the killer or knows/knew exactly what happened. I think the biggest thing that points to PR as the author is the tone and content. A RN should be demanding, mean, written in an aggressive ""or else"" way. I think the biggest thing that points to an Intruder as the author is the tone and content as well. If you read it in a voice or style that is demeaning or talking down to someone in a mocking condescending manner the note has a whole different meaning.

This is the part that I can’t grok. Maybe it’s because I was in the Sea Org, but I’m so used to Scientologists being told that the tech is bulletproof and if it’s not working it’s because you have overts or MUs. 

When I was a body router in the winter, and there was no foot traffic, nobody ever said “well, you can’t be expected to get people in when it’s 10 degrees out”. They told me to stop being reasonable and go get upstat. Obviously we all knew that it couldn’t be done, but that was the Scientology party line as I knew it. 

I agree that it’s not possible to change the mainstream church, and that it’s probably not a worthwhile goal for any believer. Could I have changed anything, even when I was in the SO? Absolutely not. 

I really did believe that the tech was bulletproof, but it obviously isn’t. But all throughout LRHs writing are claims that it works EVERY TIME and is the only thing that works at all. A single hole in the bottom of a bucket makes the whole thing useless.

"> I have no STDs, to be clear, as I am not one to expose myself to any.

How do you know? Some STD infections are asymptomatic, and if you are sexually active, you are ""one to expose yourself"" to them - even if you are scrupulous about using protection, certain infections (herpes, genital warts, etc.) remain easily transmissible. Most people believe they're not at risk of contracting an STD until they get one. Not to be condescending, but this is especially true of teenagers.

> Everybody has such a problem with this, I can't get any unbiased or unaffected opinions.

Very few people have expressed any problem with your wish to have multiple sexual partners. Personally, open relationships aren't for me, but if both parties are on the level about it and nobody's being harmed, my attitude is ""whatever floats your boat"". You, however, do not seem to be considering the ""on the level"" part. Everybody has a right to know what risks they are taking when they engage in sexual activity. Therefore everybody owes their sexual partner(s) honesty and respect, and you're not really evincing either toward yours. Put yourself in one of these people's shoes. We'll leave aside emotional attachment and betrayal of trust since you don't seem to identify with those feelings. If you came down suddenly with an STD, and you found out a sexual partner of yours had contracted it from someone else they'd been sleeping with without your knowledge and then passed it on to you, necessitating that you endure the embarrassment and expense of going to get it treated, you'd be pissed off, wouldn't you? Every time you cheat on someone without their knowledge, you are putting them at risk without their knowledge, and that is not okay. Do not do unto others as you would not have done unto you, etc."

I think the root of this hypothetical creature's distastefulness is his incredible social awkwardness. He's either too formal (""May I escort you to the Sbarro in the food court, m'lady?""), or too informal (eg combining a once-dressy hat with shorts). He makes an unnecessary spectacle of himself on facebook when someone mentions faith or religion, as he either mocks the friend/acquaintance's faith, or condescends on how much more enlightened his own spiritual path (or lack thereof) is. He does not know when an argument is over, or when one is entirely inappropriate. He's noticeably uncomfortable around men he perceives as jocks, meatheads, bad boys, thugs, etc. (because ""they do not treat women right""), but his trembling discomfort or jerky demeanor with these people--based entirely on their perceived social identities that speak more of high school clique behavior than the real adult world--reveal him to have a fundamentally adolescent mindset encased within the body of either an under-nourished or overly flabby adult man. While he outwardly declares himself to have all the qualities women desire, he is in actuality profoundly anxious around females, stumbling over his words, sweating profusely, and filling pauses in conversation with clumsy or embarrassing banter (""Your hair smells pretty... like lilacs. I bet you use the same type of conditioner as my mom. You know, I would never hurt you"").

He's uncomfortable in his own skin, and he doesn't have a well-defined sense of his own identity yet, so he relies on certain social/ideological/intellectual crutches to both superficially define his personality and create a smokescreen that distracts from his own awkward unhappiness and self-loathing.

ATMs running on XP and nuclear missiles running off floppy disks and other 1960's era technology. Upgrading or otherwise changing this to better things is ""too much work""

I can't help but look at this from an engineering perspective, and say: if the problem is unsolvable, we are trying to solve the wrong problem.

IMO laziness is condescending way of explaining other people's behaviour. People do things when they have a reason to - not because there's no reason not to. I'm using and old PC right now. There are two reasons: 1) money, and 2) fear.

An observer might say I'm too lazy to read up on how to build a PC, else I would go down that route and safe myself money. What they are missing is that I have other priorities right now. My brain can only process so much information, and around Christmas time family takes up about 80% of it.

The other 20% is divided between washing clothes, basic human interactions, and cooking food. Right now I'm eating slices of cheese from a block of mozzarella as a meal substitute. So you can tell I'm failing on that one. FYI I'm wearing a towel, and being a lot less polite than I usually am - so I'm not doing to well in the other areas either. Happily I succeeded in getting on with my family when I went around to help move furniture today, and that the most important thing.

I don't mean this personally. It's not your fault. Everyone has priorities. Yours might not be the same as mine. But I hate when people look down on others and say ""you should be doing this"", or ""you should be doing that"". Yeah, I'm a smart guy - I know I should probably brush my teeth more. But I don't. The world is full of problems and dammit most of us just do our best, you know?

The problem here is people being lazy. It's manyfold. Humans are complicated. Sometimes they are smart, and other times they are totally stupid.

One reason behind standards not catching on might simply be education. I didn't know there was a standard for versioning until I read this thread. I bet there are mod authors who don't either.

And for those who do know of it, perhaps they don't understand it? Just above we have Enai talking about the system he prefers. If there are people who spend this much time on modding but don't follow the official standard, maybe there needs to be more communication within the modding community to agree on one? How do you get that to happen? I don't know.

Maybe Enai knows he should be using a different versioning, but is afraid that people will shout at him for changing? I know some of them will. What do we do about that?

Maybe we need education and discussion within the community of people who use mods? Only the community is mostly a fairly loose collection of people with similar interests. We're not homogenous, we don't all go to the same places for information.

Do you see how making assumptions about other people's behaviour and motivations can disguise a rather complex one as something very simply - and, incidentally, other people's fault?.

We're all human. We all make mistakes. I've just written more than I intended to. I'm grumpy because I'm tired but I can't get to sleep, because I'm experiencing anxiety. But I'm still trying. So my advice to approaching this standards problem is trying to understand other people. Next time we have a versioning conference, maybe we will account for the human factor better. Or maybe this standard was never intended for gaming mods, and that's why it didn't account for the problems we are facing?

All I'm saying is try to give people the benefit of the doubt. Things may not be perfect, but it we all try our best I think we can make the world a better place - or at least fix little things like this to make them a bit less irritating."

"Well, you certainly didn't include much information like labs, which are quintessential to any method of HRT. Your focus on total testosterone, and zero focus on E2, SHBG, free testosterone, or honestly anything but total, is probably holding you back. 

You need full lab tests done, especially on hCG and clomid. Both are known to raise E2 significantly, with clomid even having an isomer that directly acts AS estrogen, therefore synergising with E2. 

Labs from each step would be helpful. 

> I was put on what I thought was a very conservative dose - 2,000IU 2/week

The E3.5D part is fucking you up, especially for hCG mono. You need it EOD or ED. That large dose at once is really really bad for stable levels. 

> It ceasing to work did seem to correlate directly to my digestive problems

Could be. I imagine you have some form of autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease that makes you feel horrible when it flares. So it's possible that is overpowering the positive feelings of HRT. 

I think that's more likely. Eventually, the clomid is going to be absorbed somewhere in the GI tract. 

> I've seen a couple papers talking about hCG needing to be dosed up to 10,000 IU daily to maintain normal testosterone levels

Why would one even do that? That's a failed organ at that point, the testes are dead, just inject test cyp. No sense in trying to CPR your testes alive lol.

because it hasn't been proven. I don't buy it either.

Honestly, why even try hCG mono over TRT? It offers nearly no benefits to TRT, and is just as suppressive. Clomid at least you're not shut down. 

Significantly less stability, too. Honestly, why? Sincere question.

> I think it would really help to know why I'm having these issues in the first place, but everyone just seems to want to manage symptoms.

Well, full labs from when you felt best on each would be a start. 200mg per week TRT is a LOT. E2 needs to be managed at that dose.

A forum dominated by those who support firearms and knife rights, for example, will invariably be visited by Contrarian Trolls espousing their beliefs in the benefits of gun control. It is important to distinguish between dissenters and actual Contrarian Trolls, however; the Contrarian is not categorized as a troll because of his or her dissenting opinions, but due to the manner in which he or she behaves:

– Contrarian Warning Sign Number One: The most important indicator of a poster’s Contrarian Troll status is his constant use of subtle and not-so-subtle insults, a technique intended to make people angry. Contrarians will resist the urge to be insulting at first, but as their post count increases, they become more and more abusive of those with whom they disagree. Most often they initiate the insults in the course of what has been a civil, if heated, debate to that point.

– Contrarian Warning Sign Number Two: Constant references to the forum membership as monolithic. “You guys are all just [descriptor].” “You’re a lynch mob.” “You all just want to ridicule anyone who disagrees with you.”

– Contrarian Warning Sign Number Three: Intellectual dishonesty. This is only a mild indicator that is not limited to trolls, but Contrarians display it to a high degree. They will lie about things they’ve said, pull posts out of context in a manner that changes their meanings significantly, and generally ignore any points for which they have no ready answers.

– Contrarian Warning Sign Number Four: Accusing the accusers. When confronted with their trolling, trolls immediately respond that it is the accusers who are trolls (see Natural Predators below). Often the Contrarian will single out his most vocal opponent and claim that while he can respect his other opponents, this one in particular is beneath his notice.

– Contrarian Warning Sign Number Five: Attempts to condescend. The Contrarian will seek refuge in condescending remarks that repeatedly scorn his or her critics as beneath notice – all the while continuing to respond to them.""

You are describing the things you have to deprive yourself of, mostly food related. We have to do that too. Depression is horrible and I sympathize with your struggles. Most people with an autoimmune disorder struggle with depression in addition to the following:

Day in, day out debilitating pain. Or the deforming pain of RA or MS. When your body doesn't do what your brain is telling it to do and your sudden muscle weakness sends you crashing to the ground; or worse, down a flight of stairs. When you are exhausted after walking up a few steps even though you are otherwise fit. Insomnia despite bone deep tiredness. Diarrhea and constipation despite a careful adherence to diet. Horrible gut pain that is indescribable and constant enough to make you wish for death. When you need a nap after a shower or bath. Having to isolate yourself from everybody so you don't catch a cold or virus that will kill you. When your meds almost make you feel as bad as your symptoms.

I think we should be aware that some people can't afford software. Especially those in poorer/oppressed nations where £30-50 a month might be a lot of your salary. They still have the right to use software and make creative works. I would be conscious of how to explain this situation in a way which isn't condescending to people who don't earn $500 a day.

Most software companies work on a model where they know X amount will be stolen but the paid subscription makes up for it.

I'm not condoning piracy in any legal sense on this forum, but I think people should be aware this is a debate and is discussed and there are more sides to it.

If we want to talk in terms of stealing then maybe we could talk about the chips in computers/phones/electronics and where they get the raw materials from, and how much they pay for them (and the exploitative labour costs/conditions to manufacture and process), and seriously consider how that can also be - and is - described as stealing.

"> Why isn't the Zionist movement considered racist, or at the very least separationalist? The Jewish community has been ostracized and shunned from many places throughout history. To me it seems like it's no different than Muslim's enforcing Sharia Law, or Mormons enforcing strict values upon their communities...

These seem like three completely unrelated statements.

Zionism began as a Nationalist movement, but it is not seen as racist because race really has nothing to do with it. There are Zionists of all ""races"". (And Israel is a multi-cultural, secular democratic state where race plays no institutional role).

> To me it seems like it's no different than Muslim's enforcing Sharia Law, or Mormons enforcing strict values upon their communities...

What does? Zionism? I don't understand how you could possibly make that comparison, unless you know virtually nothing about Zionism or Israel...

> I notice a ton of people disagreeing on specific things in relation to the Torah, and more specifically a general separation within your own community. How does that affect Judaism?

Those that agree to the basic terms of what Torah means are unified despite all their disagreement. The multiplicity of facets of Torah is part of its beauty and has always been part of Judaism.

Those who take themselves out of the established system completely have started some of their own movements that are unified under their own terms. The traditional movements recognise Jews in these movements as misguided or incorrect Jews, and the Jews in less traditional movements consider the traditional Jews in a similar way. So they don't necessarily view each other as legitimate facets of Judaism, but there is still a sense of national brotherhood.

Similarly, Jews who identify only culturally or ethnically are still part of the nation/culture, and so there is still that sense of brotherhood, even if there is little common ground or unity of purpose.

> Jews appear to form deep communities that are occasionally do not coincide with our modern melting pot

This is only partially true, only in some instances. It's not across the board. In fact it's a tiny minority, and I think even a minority among the strictly Orthodox.

> how can a a traditional Orthodox Jew cry foul on history, and yet at the same time be anti-homosexual? Shouldn't we be promoting minority movements for fear that what happened to the Jews could happen to them?

I don't really understand this. No Jew ever has advocated for genocide or exile/ghettoisation of any group of people, that I'm aware of.

So what equivalence do you see?

Plenty of minority movements are still anti-Jewish. It's not relevant, but you seem to think that minorities would naturally band together over being minorities, which evidently doesn't happen.

Furthermore, I don't think most Jews would support the discrimination against or persecution of any other group, even when they disagree with that group's beliefs or practices, or even when they themselves are racist. And I think Jews have a pretty good historical track record of being at the forefront of opposition to persecution, often actively, but often also just passively (for example, employing people despite social or legal opposition to the practice).

In the case of homosexuality specifically, many traditional Jews are opposed to legalising gay marriage, many believe homosexuality to be immoral. But few would condone hate crimes or employment discrimination or anything like that. And many are in favour of legalising gay marriage and gay rights because they don't believe it's any of the government's business, even if they don't condone gay sex.

> How do I respect your beliefs, your practices and thoughts without coming off as anti-Semitic? 

That's exceptionally easy. The challenge is in not respecting beliefs or practices (or being generally misinformed about what those are) without coming off as anti-semitic.

> I don't want to appear that way, but sometimes the statements I make definitely sound it.

Yup. Not terribly, but a little. It's possible that you're just not phrasing your thoughts optimally, or it could be that even though you don't want to be prejudiced, you have internalised messages from your background, like we all have.

It's no biggie either way (I don't think you are antisemitic, by the way), as long as you're committed to genuinely seeking to understand, and to being more sensitive when you know how to. That's the best any of us can do, really.

And I don't mean to be condescending. There's a good chance that everyone's a little bit racist ;)"

"> Sikhs were the originally land owners of what became pakistan. How is it fair to create a country without and against the wishes of the original landowners?

Maybe you should ask Banda Singh Bahadur; his empire (which I would argue was more directly in line with Sikh ideals however short-lived), actually dissolved the zamindar system completely and created a more democratized system wherein those who actually worked the land owned it. The Zamindar system at that point had extremely favored Muslim aristocrats the Mughals had put into power and Hindu/Muslim workers were put under extreme economic burden. To champion the Zamindar system solely when it favored Sikhs, IMO, does a great disservice. 

Ranjit Singh simply replaced several (not all) of these Mughal Zamindars with Sikh Zamindars. This was typical whenever new rulers came into play. The British actually changed this dynamic by allowing the incumbent Zimidars (Muslims and Sikhs alike) to stay in power. The British also helped enable a new class of Sikh landowners; the canal colonies project recruited Sikhs from Malwa to develop land in Pakistan that they could then keep for themselves. My family was one such group of people, and we had a ton of land in Pakistan Punjab, sure; but it was thanks to the British.

>And whose whole religion and holyland is splitting of that land?

Actually this was given plenty of thought which is why Sikhs were given such a prominent say in Partition dealings and also why aspects of Gurdaspur Tehsil were given to India even if inconsistent population-wise. But keep in mind the majority of Punjab is still Muslim; there is no way they would create a majority Sikh state in Punjab with that dynamic, especially with the Muslim league lobbying. 

Anyway, theologically there's no such thing as a ""holy land"" in Sikhi. Patna Sahib and Hazur Sahib speak for themselves. 

>Obvious to me, as I stated earlier, it was a British colonial plan who had their puppets in place to ensure Sikhs never regained their powerful Sikh empire and political sovereignty.

Sounds like conspiracies to me with no basis in historical evidence. The British de-armed Sikhs and tried to use their martial identity for their own aims (this is well recorded), but ironically this backfired on them when Sikhs started holding guns from their service in the British. This massive military stockpile the Sikhs amassed is a reason why in Partition Sikhs actually were relatively safe compared to other groups. If they implanted spies to keep Sikhs weak, those spies sure as hell were incompetent.

The treachery of Laal and Tej Singh should be recognized of course, but that was a specific wartime occurrence. Not to mention that Gulab Singh Dogra wasn't just straight-up British implant, his aim was to gain control of Kashmir. 

>As for British assistance in 1984....it should have been towards the Sikhs who they had victimised since 1840s it should not have been for the despotic regime of Indira gandhi. Plus the american CIA was already meddling in Indian punjab via their well placed agents and their allies in pakistani ISI so why did British govt military assist a soviet allied country (india) when it would make sense to aid the Sikh rebels in order to create more trouble for the soviet enemies during the cold war.

1) There is no way the British would have supported Bhindranwale. Looking at it from a purely political perspective he was an insurrectionist; unless they were trying to fund Sikh guerrillas to usurp India, it would not make any sense for them to support them. 

2) You're right in mapping out the alliances at the time but keep in mind that Margaret Thatcher and Indira Gandhi were close friends AND Britain's relationship was still cordial with India at the time. Alliances matter to some extent but overall America was the one aggressively making anti-Soviet foreign policy, most of Europe was pretty isolationist in this sense. So it's not far removed for IG's government to have casually approached Thatcher's. 

3) I doubt the CIA itself was meddling in Punjab. It's field of operations with regards to its policy in Pakistan was limited to a specific context, especially in the Soviet-Afghan war. There was no incentive for them to get involved in Punjab whatsoever.

>I think it would be rather extraordinary if anyone understood ""why is there something rather than nothing"" to mean ""how does stuff appear in quantum fields.""

Sure, but I don't think that's a fair representation of the argument. I think most people have the intuition that it is possible to have a box with nothing in it, and what that means is that the box has no physical ""stuff"". No matter, no energy, etc. You remove everything from the box, including the air, and now it's an empty box with ""nothing"" in it.

So Krauss's first observation is that even when you do that, the box still has particles popping in and out of existence all the time. There's even a nonzero average energy to this empty space, which means that it weighs something. I think that's an extremely surprising fact that a lay audience would find illuminating.

So in that classical state that his audience thinks of as nothing, it turns out that something (e.g. particles) can and do pop into existence spontaneously.

So, he could have stopped there, and it would have been interesting, but it wouldn't really have told us much about why there's a universe (or how, I guess, if we're sticking to his adjusted language). It seems like a lot of critics, though, do just stop there and object that the quantum vacuum is clearly not nothing. Krauss agrees, but the principle of particles appearing when they didn't exist before is setting us up for the next definition of nothing, which is no matter, energy, space, time, or even physical laws that govern them. The only thing remaining, as I understand it (and I am not an astrophysicist, so I understand it in the language of flawed metaphors and oversimplifications rather than mathematics) is a principle of quantum gravity that makes even that state unstable such that we would expect universes (full of space, time, energy, matter, and widely variable physical laws and constants) to spontaneously appear where they hadn't before, much like the particles springing into existence in the quantum vacuum.

I think at this point, we're well into the territory of what even a well-informed a layman would consider nothing. If we exclude even this on the grounds that quantum gravity is something, what we're saying is that a fundamental instability that makes it possible for universes to spontaneously leap into existence is not nothing. What this essentially means is that explicability itself is defined to be something. In that event the question has been defined to be unanswerable, so I don't really fault Krauss for not being interested in that version of the question. It just doesn't seem productive to ask questions that are unanswerable by definition.

>Except merely being explicit doesn't avoid equivocation.

"> Jante-law societies

You do realise that this is not actually a thing right? The concept was coined in 1933 to sarcastically describe the ethos in the 19th century. The only people I ever hear talk about it are people who feel oppressed for not being praised as much as they liked, although being fairly mundane people. No one knows that there are ""10 rules of the Jante"" for example.

What OP might experience is that people around him are disrespectful and condescending, but that is just people being douches, not following some antic social norm. There are those people everywhere and before he thinks that he needs to flee Sweden, I would recommend him to simply get a new social circle. Studying at uni will most certainly help since people there tend to be more respecting of personal preferences and life styles."
"/u/doihavetodad is correct. If this is about banning abortions past the point of viability then 20 weeks doesn't make sense. It should be 24 weeks and even then there are significant chances of permanent dysfunction and retardation.

>Anti-abortion activists have coalesced around 20 weeks because, they say, that’s when fetuses begin to feel pain.

Now read the very next sentence:

>The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, however, says that pain doesn’t occur until 27 weeks.

Now we go back to what you said:

>I can't speak for the people who wrote the law, but I'm assuming they did it because...

and

>I'm not a lawyer so I'm not going to read the bill...

And we find that you are very ill-equipped to continue this conversation. You're trying very hard to insert reason and logic, which I respect, into a situation where reason and logic are not at the forefront of the debate and you haven't even read the bill in question nor do you seem to grasp the reasoning behind it. If reason and logic were applied we would find that there are valid, reasonable, logical, and legitimate reasons for abortion after 20 weeks that don't necessarily involve the death of the mother. 

What we're actually looking at is an extension of non-secular beliefs being inserted into secular legislation because of non-secular beliefs wrapped in the guise of caring for unborn children which is being pushed by the very same people who don't give a damn about your health or well being after birth.

And you're just OM NOM NOM'ing it all up and arguing for it. There's a lot more going on here than just 'the fetus may survive after 20 weeks so we shouldn't abort after that'.

"I wrote this in another comment but I'll copy it here, as I mistakenly thought I was responding to you before.

------------------

Only those whose faith is ultimately in Christ will be saved. But it is very presumptuous to believe you know who that is. The purpose of focusing on outward confession is to have the chance to be corrected if you're wrong. But God looks at the hearts of men.

I don't know whether or not those who did not outwardly confess Jesus were saved or not by their inward faith. Abraham didn't confess Jesus, for he did not know him, but yet he was saved by faith in him demonstrated by his obedience to God.

The point is ""the Son gives life to whom he will ([John 5:21 ESV])"".

-----------

> ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.""

> or am I taking that out of context? So how many people accept Jesus as their personal lord and savior and are members of the right Christian sect and have never sinned?

I charitably assume that you are interpreting the verse correctly. The problem isn't in your interpretation of the verse but in your application of your understanding.

The only sure way to be saved is to outwardly confess faith in Christ and to live a life consistent with that faith (for faith without works is dead, [James 2:14 ESV]). Nobody fully knows the motivations of a person, not even necessarily the person themselves. But by looking at their actions and whether they are consistent with the faith they profess they can draw closer or further away from that ideal that they claim they value. But it's not by their actions, even the action of saying that Jesus is Lord ([Matthew 7:21-23]), that they are saved. They are saved by their inward faith in Jesus as Lord and afterward living in accordance with that faith.

Now is it to be supposed that everybody who doesn't physically say that Jesus Christ is Lord is in hell? No. Because Abraham didn't believe in Jesus by name. But he was yet justified by his faith in him (Romans 4 ESV) according to his obedience in the God that was revealed to him. And we know that ""no one comes to the father but by [Jesus] ([John 14:6 ESV])"".

So God chose to reveal ([Genesis 12:1, 13:14, 15:1, 15:4, 16:11, 17:1, 18:1 ESV]) himself to Abraham and Abraham obeyed and demonstrates his faith. God can reveal himself to whomever he chooses, however he chooses, and Jesus is the Word proceeding from God ([John 1:1-7 ESV]) so whoever responds by placing their faith in him is saved.

We don't get to place constraints upon God and say, because I can't see that these people have confessed Jesus as their Lord and God, they are damned to hell. Because that would be making us the judge of whether or not they have faith, and the Bible is very clear that all judgment has been given to Jesus ([John 5:22]).

But it is also the case that the Bible, affirmed as the inspired (by the Holy Spirit) Word of God which gives testimony about Christ, testifies about the faith in Jesus Christ which is able to save. Though we can't say definitively that so and so is not saved because we cannot judge their hearts as God does ([1 Samuel 16:7 ESV]) we can say definitively that if they are saved by faith in Jesus then the faith that they are saved by is consistent, however it is expressed inwardly or outwardly, with the faith that the Bible teaches, because their faith if it is saving is in God who does not change.

For this reason as I said before, it is better to outwardly confess Christ as Lord according to the Bible so that one might be saved. And if there is something wrong with the articulation of their faith, they can be corrected and led to have a faith which is consistent with what is taught by the Bible.

I watched. It's condescending libertarian bullshit. E.g. the internet only exists today because of government investment, regulations, and other interventions, not because of free markets.

I'm not biased against markets, I'm biased in favor of historical facts.

Make sure we all know we're more spiritual than those people who pretend to be spiritual?

Mockery is an undesirable quality, but, by shaming people who try to shame others, you are trying to scare them into acting like they agree with you by using their desire for acceptance and love against them. This is only going to breed shame and repressed anger in them. We're talking about people who are so insecure that they resort to mocking other people in terms of spirituality to make themselves feel good. They don't need your scorn, they need your love.

"So here is my general comment. A commentor threatens violence (or at least professes violent urges) towards people with a minority opinion, and when that group shows up to defend ourselves it's ""condescending"". Even with no exaggerations, no name calling and certainly no implications of violence. We are the problem. Why is that? 

Because our beliefs are so out of the mainstream that hearing them is uncomfortable. Saying what we mean honestly sounds like aggression.

> Other than not responding at all

Well, I don't mind him being angry. However, given the horrifying state of the world I do think it's wrong to be silent given any opportunity to make it known that not everyone thinks that animals are objects to be used. Not just unfortunate, wrong.

Similar to how perhaps if you passed a guy in a progressive area going on a racist or homophobic tirade, perhaps walking around this guy is the right thing to do. No one takes him seriously, he is angry and unpleasant. Move on. I agree.

However, if you are at an event and sitting near someone who is on a tirade about a certain group (especially including language about wanting to strangle them!), but the audience is mostly people who agree, then yeah it would be wrong not to say. ""Hey, I think those people you are disparaging are people too."" Would that be an uncomfortable thing to say? Yes. Would it be condescending? As much as what I have been saying. Is it the right thing to do? Of course. Strangling people you don't like is not a lifestyle choice. And no one (who wasn't a bigot) would look at that situation and call the person who said something ""the problem.""

But beyond that, with animal rights we have not just a society of people who don't believe animals have any rights and who believe animals theoretically should be treated as things, we actually have a situation where people are actively treating animals as things. Killing them, hurting them, violating them. Everywhere. This is unspeakably urgent. 

> If people respond to an angry person by being emotional back at them, things always just spiral out of control

Except that it didn't?

I agree, I could have come in and listed facts about the dairy industry, but that would have been a non sequitor. The response I gave was completely honest, again it's really the case that the lifestyle of the person I was responding to is violent towards animals. 

The only polite way to respond is to say ""well, I respect your choice, but here are fact."" The problem is that abusing animals and killing baby animals who want to live should not be a valid choice when there are other options. Saying so is just saying what is true.

tl;dr What we believe is uncomfortable, that's why you think we sound angry."
">Most definitely yes. You choose what you want to do in life, and to what ends.

I guess all those people who suffer from clinical depression just like not having energy, interest, or will.

I know this is quotesporn, where we don't typically let things like science or rationality get in the way of our happy little beliefs, but ""Most definitely yes"" is just a bit too much bullshit and it's actually quite condescending... We can define ""choice"" in a manner such that on the face of it, the statement sounds true, but just because you're conscious of some decisions being made in your brain, doesn't mean you have actual control over what decisions are being made or how you feel about them. This is particularly obvious when we see how predictable actions are with certain hormonal ""imbalances"" but it's true for all of us."
">You have anecdotal evidence to support your opinion.

No, these are hard facts. Accredited library schools produce about 7,300 librarians per year. About 1,800 of them get jobs as librarians. Source. That means over 5,000 new people every year have to read articles like the OP and fool themselves into believing that they are still a librarian despite working at Starbucks while library assistants doing real library work are not librarians.

>It's as artificial as any other title conferred to someone based on education or experience.

Each professional association is different and has its own needs. For some it's a matter of life-or-death and licenses and accreditation matter. I'm only talking about ALA and the librarian profession, which I personally believe is outdated at this time. No one cares if the person who comes over to fix your toilet is a plumber or plumber's assistant. If plumbers decide to organize differently they should, just as I believe librarians should. Besides, there's been a move towards the title ""information professional"" in recent years. Why not just call everyone a librarian?

>The education IS the difference.

No it isn't. The work is the difference. The article made the condescending claim that everyone who gets an MLS is a librarian even if they don't have a library job. It's a feelgood measure meant to lift the spirits of people competing in a diluted job market, but it's not sane. Who is the librarian... someone with an MLS that works in a sporting goods store or someone who works in a library?

>Do you have a library degree and, if so, from where?

Not gonna answer that out of principle. Pretend I'm either a disgruntled library assistant or concerned librarian. Or neither.

>You've demonstrated that you don't think my education and resulting degree are valuable.

It isn't. The job market proves that explicitly. 

>You know, I get mistaken for a Doctor with some regularity, but that doesn't make me a doctor. How does this support your point?

Because if you tried to practice medicine you'd make horrible mistakes and maybe cost someone their life. A library assistant can help a patron as well as a librarian.

>I disagree. I expect that when we start calling the high school kids we hire to do shelving a Librarian, the faculty of this university to understand Librarian to mean something entirely different. In your vision, Librarian will mean ""I could be talking to a idiot kid. Why am I wasting my time?"" rather than what I think it means to many of them ""I'll call my subject librarian whom I can trust to be educated and experienced in my field.""

So when professors meet circulation librarians are they confused that they are subject specialists in their field? Of course not. It is up to the librarian to establish rapport and help the professor trust that the collection is in good hands. Don't send a high schooler to do this job, send someone with experience. That experience could be a degree. I'm not saying there is no place for an MLS, only that comparable experience should be enough to earn the title ""librarian"".

I don't understand the quotes. Let me know where it is that I lose track:

You contrast ethics and morality with relations to lifeless things here:

> ethics and morality deal with how we treat things that can suffer or flourish based on our dealings with them. 
> We don't have ethical obligations to a rock

I interpret this to mean that ethics and morality is about ethical obligations. I also interpret an obligation as something we should, and an ethical obligation as something we should because it's right (as opposed to wrong).

> We decide how we ""flourish""

> We can decide on our own axioms: who else could do so for us?

Who are ""we""? All of us together, like in a referendum? Or ""humanity"", as in that the discoveries of science will prove it? 

Or ""we"" as in that I decide my axioms and what flourishing is, and you decide for yourself?

I don't mean to sound condescending, but aren't you just saying what you (or this Harris guy) think is an adequate reasoning for going about your business in life?

If so, then I think I know why I don't understand you. OPs question was:

> I'm really interested in the topic of morality, but I don't understand it at all. What is the best argument for the idea that there is an inherent ""right"" and ""wrong"", behaviorally speaking, in the universe?

Define counterproductive though. Would there be blow back from ""rebels/insurgents""? Yes. Would people be asked to sacrifice their lives, risk their friends and families lives? Yes. Horrible shit can and most definitely would happen in a context such as this, so unless it's directly undermining the stated objectives, then I need to ask what else do you see as counterproductive here?

It'll be chalked full of crimes against humanity and other ugly, brutal shit that we typically only think of in the context of happening in some remote part of the world. People are right to fear such a situation. I'm pretty sure at the high of Civil Rights marches and protests, there were a lot of people who weren't sure if they'd make it home each night and that was far more civil than what is being proposed here. 

> If it winds up bringing down violence upon innocent people, what right do you have to do that?

I feel that I could argue this a number of different ways depending on what the specific concerns are but the truth is innocent people WILL be hurt and suffer. It's impossible to promise anything else. Ideally, you do your best to minimize suffering for both sides of the conflict. If you want full on idealism, I wouldn't be participating in this for just myself or my own, but what I believe to be in everyone's best interest ( path to hell is paved in good intentions ). I have no doubts people would disagree with that and with me and my reasons for it. 

Truth is this would be a crucible to forge something different. It's impossible to say what that would look like when it's said and done, but life and perserving life is a risk. It's a gamble. There are no sure bets and better men have tried and failed. I completely realize that, but at the end of the day I would put more faith in comes from the fallout of a conflict than I would in a system that is broken beyond repair without a conflict. I see a system that threatens my childrens' futures. I see a system that is being used to establish all the things that it was initially designed to prevent. I see a system that is failing everyone, regardless of political party.

Where do I shun? I say get the people who are pretty much not following the religion and get them to go all the way.

Purpose served - I don't know, kids not killing themsevles for being gay, the end of genital mutilation in kids, the end of telling kids that ""we didn't evolve from no monkeys"", etc. etc. etc.

He's still being a condescending douche (""Look at me, I have a direct line to god and know what he thinks is good or bad and blah blah blah but guess what it's probably all cool cuz i'm just that smart!"") and he'd be better off learning that religion is bullshit, and he can drop the pretext and just be good without all the nonsense.

I think OP is wrong on this when saying that mansplaining and manspreading ""is just as repugnant as any other slur"". Because there is a very large history of racist slurs being used in order to dehumanize groups. 

But I think certain slurs are more offensive than others. When you say, ""some other slur"" you are equivocating nr with every other slur. This is wrong. 

It also isn't right to say:

>Complaints about rude behavior (referred to in a generalized manner) that are more common as a type of behavior in a demographic that is encouraged to speak out more (typically men)is not the same as calling someone [...] some other slur.

I think it depends on the slur. Just because one group of people is louder, doesn't mean they need to be shut up. It also doesn't mean any demographics have the right to interrupt or to quickly dismiss an argument. I think it means something needs to be changed in order to encourage the other group to speak more.

> Considering you also have the public opinion in your back to feel confident this is just a point where I can't actually support my opinion in any way that'll go over well for me. 

Maybe you should consider that reason you can't actually support your opinion has nothing to do with the argumentum ad populum you just implied (what you did right there? that's bad faith arguing) and everything to do with the fact that you're trying to argue about personal sexual preferences and thus you are being disrespectful of the sexual identity of others.

> the focus of her characterisation in the original wasn't in the form of development but was to reveal all the layers and depth to her character. 

This is a very vague and very generalized statement that could said of pretty much anyone except the Main Character. Depth? She was an edgy teenager that stopped being as edgy after her brother rekt the shit out of her. That's about as simply as I can put it. After that she basically became a background character with little to no development other than being a helpless bystander to what shenanigans Kaneki and co got into. Then :re came along and Touka was less than a side character, she was practically non-existent for the longest time. 

Back in the early days of :re who was everyone praising and rooting for and shipping with Kaneki, I'll give you a hint, it doesn't rhyme with ""rocha."" Eto was infinitely more interesting and involved in the plot than Touka ever has been. Touka was a major player in the first few volumes of the original, and if she had kept pace with everyone else then she'd be a major player to this day and her reintroduction wouldn't have been taken so negatively. But she completely fell off the map and then came back pretty damn suddenly and got pregnant and married to Kaneki. So she went from background character straight back into the limelight given the lamest and most contrived reason of all, pregnancy and a stale love plot. 

Contrived - adjective - deliberately created rather than arising naturally or spontaneously.

Plot Device - A plot device, or plot mechanism, is any technique in a narrative used to move the plot forward.[1] A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the suspension of disbelief.

Her pregnancy/love story is a plot device in almost the most literal way possible. Her pregnancy is basically the fucking One Ring from LOTR. 

If you'll see my above comment, youll see the point I make about being nothing about her being ""uniquely Touka."" There isn't a single thing about her that makes her stand out among other ghouls/humans in the story. The acceptance of ghoul life development she has undergone has been undergone in a more interesting way, by more interesting characters like Hinami. And in every other corner of her development, I could site other more interesting characters who developed the same general things in a much more interesting way.

"> My follow up question would be, do you think that upon going to the higher grades, 9th - 11th that grading was necessary? How do you think that the older grades would have gone for you and your peers if you had continued not receiving grades?

We attend ""folkeskole"" until 9th grade and then we go to gymnasium (high school) For 3 years. I think grading in 8th and 9th grade is necessary to the extent that it prepares you for gymnasium (though not everyone pursues that. Some will learn a trade or something like that. But I guess trade schools have grades too). I think the transition from ""not grades"" to ""grades"" could just as well have been done when I started gymnasium. I think low grades might have demotivated some of the kids in my class who didn't do so well. It's hard on the self esteem if you continue to get bad grades even if you try to improve. Some are just not very acedemically minded but they will still work hard, you know.

It's hard to answer if I would have done better or worse had there not been grades. I think I would have done about the same as I enjoy learning. But the grades added some pressure. Hard to say if that is bad or good. I was always above average both before and after I started receiving grades. But I did kick it up a nudge with my homework in the 8th grade. I remember thinking ""This is my last year to fuck around"" in the 7th grade :P

>I love the idea of the smiley faces, I will totally be using that with my classes in the future.

The smileyfaces are great for younger students. I don't know if it might seem.. I don't know.. Condescending somehow? To high school students that is. Maybe make them rate themselves with a star-system (1-5) when they are high school aged? But I don't know. I am not a teacher - these are just my laymans thoughts on the subject. You could try it out and see how your kids like it!

Another thing.. Even if you in the end choose to keep the normal grading it can be turned around as to not be so ""number-fixated"". I will always ask people if they are happy with their grade instead of asking what grade they got. If they bring up the grade that is up to themselves, but asking if they are happy/content with it puts the focus on the accomplishment and self-improvement instead of putting focus on getting the highest number possible. 

But anyway. I feel that, at least in my country, the external forces are a big factor in stressing out the young people. My niece is 14 (8th grade) and I talked about school with her the other day. A year ago she talked about going to the states for a year after 9th grade to attend an American high school for a year. Now she didn't want to do that because she was scared of getting behind compared to her friends. Right now there is a lot of governmental pressure on young people to not take time off between educations so I think that affects her. I told her not to worry about that stuff. As mentioned above I never ask her about her grades. I have no idea where she's at grade-wise. But to show interest in her learning I will ask her if she is happy with them.

Also, Beau doesn't 'pick on' Caleb more than anyone else. In fact, she's probably had more positive interactions with him than most people in the party.

You don't take an arrow for someone you have zero respect for or bully.

>since if he had left it alone they might have escaped without being caught.

And if Caleb hadn't messed with it at all, like he was supposed to, maybe they would have made it out even earlier. So? (And I think Matt probably would've had them discovered anyway, somehow, but we don't know. Honestly, what happened is probably the best result considering how things went down.)

>suggesting they beat her up as a distraction

...Like that time Caleb actually beat up Nott as a distraction?

Nott's stolen from them and people they want to be friends with, one of their very first interactions with the party was a con job, and Caleb would hoard magical objects and can be condescending when it comes to matters regarding the arcana. It's not like either of them have shown the party plenty of respect, either. Nott in particular doesn't generally make nice with anyone other than Jester and kind of Yasha. Still, the rest of the Nein show signs of respecting them, many different times in many different, small ways including taking damage intended for them. Of particular note, people don't immediately offer to go kill someone's entire village because someone was treated poorly if they don't have some degree of fondness for them-- iirc, it was Jester and Beau in particular who assured Nott that she had a place with the group.

All of the M9 are flawed and pretty much everyone has done something shitty to one of their fellow party members at one point or another. I just think it's gross that Beau and Marisha get shouldered with the majority of criticisms and outrage over it, especially considering, as I said, she didn't do something like threaten Caleb with physical harm or ostracization from the group over it."

It's silly to expect to convert people already using direct from China shops, and the last thing you should want to do is spread awareness of the significant advantages to potential customer's bank balances.

>I appreciate your thoughts, you'll have to expound on this future-time orientation.

Gladly.

We admit maybe 1-1.5 million immigrants into the United States annually. For many of these people, this represents an improvement in quality of life. Wouldn't it make sense, then, to admit 2 million? Or 3 million? Why would anyone stand in the way of helping more people?

I'll tell you why: because our social safety nets cannot accommodate nearly that many immigrants. That many people would quickly strain and then bankrupt many of our services. Then we'd have increased economic turmoil and socioeconomic struggles in our country, and none of this would be limited to immigrants. Now we're torpedoing one economy or country or system to help another - and the victims include any future generations belonging to that nation.

What many liberals/progressives see as ""evil"" or ""inhumane"" or ""a lack of empathy"" in their conservative peers is actually a very sincere interest in the sustainability of relevant systems. Sometimes altruism is short sighted or even reckless. Sometimes interfering with the harsh limiting factors imposed by nature can actually threaten the viability of an entire culture or society.

At the risk of sounding very condescending, I was once a bleeding heart liberal. I used to dismiss conservatives as basically selfish evil bastards. Over time, I've come to realize that their pragmatism is a necessary balancing force in government and society.

Neither side of this divide should ever ""win"". We need liberal sentiments to keep us in the moment, but we need conservative ideas to plan for the future - and neither is more moral or empathetic than the other."

Have they said this just about employers, or grad schools too? I feel like a grad school would still care, even if it's just because your initial application might go into pile B instead of pile A. I have no experience, however.

Anyway, my point is that ""I need this fixed so my application for grad school is more competitive"" may work even when ""This is bothering me"" does not. However, if you've previously indicated no interest in grad school, they might notice the contradiction.

On the bright side, if you are considering grad school, you might be able to turn this into a selling point. They'll probably want to know more about you on your application, and you can spin the change in your GPA with a narrative about how you turned your life around and now understand the value of hard work, bootstraps, and puppies. Given that the before/after is such a dramatic change, and that there's a 10 year gap, that might work.

If you're not planning on grad school but just employment, then yeah, they're probably not going to care too much. So you've got that going for you, at least.

This might come across as condescending, but it's meant as real advice. I'd recommend you make a spreadsheet to keep track of your current GPA and ignore the old grades entirely. It won't help fix your record, but at least it will help you see the difference--and that may help keep your spirits up, if nothing else.

Also keep in mind that GPA is, at the end of the day, less important than how much you actually learn (and who you actually meet). It sounds cliche but it's true.

GPA really only exists as an attempt to measure the actual value of your education, rather than being the purpose of the education itself. It sounds like you're working hard an doing a good job, and you'll come out of this better-prepared as a result. No number will take that away from you."

">Just to be clear, do you believe that Skylar is emotionally abusing Walt?

You are correct in assuming that I am somewhat hesitant to use that term, and here is the reason:

I believe that, for the most part, there are significant differences between the ways that men typically abuse women and the ways that women typically abuse men. Additionally, most resources for recognizing emotional abuse are written with an eye towards a male perpetrator and a female victim. As a direct consequence of these differences and this bias in the documentation, it is harder for most people to recognize emotional abuse perpetrated by women against men.

As an example, a friend of mine runs a treatment group that male domestic violence offenders are made to attend to reduce recidivism rates. He has told me that when men hit women, it is typically in the context of an argument. It escalates from yelling to hitting. When women are the aggressors, the typical scenario looks more like this:

Jane has been struck and terrorized by John for some time, but he hasn't yet been caught by the police. One day, John is fast asleep on the couch, and Jane walks into the room. She sees him in a vulnerable position, is suddenly overcome by rage, picks up a baseball bat or similar object, and begins beating him with all her might. By the time John realizes what is happening, Jane has already injured him enough that it is substantially harder for him to defend himself.

This is a really different scenario. In this scenario:

 The perpetrator has a reason we can understand for being angry with the victim.

 There is no verbal or argumentative component immediately preceding the violence.

 The perpetrator is using a weapon.

This is a really different scenario. Some people might be tempted to judge Jane less harshly or excuse her actions because her reason for beating him is more understandable. Other people might judge her more harshly because she used a weapon and struck while he was defenseless, while still others might see the same facts and consider the use of stealth and a weapon as necessary and understandable compensation for her lack of physical strength.

My purpose is not to judge Jane. It is to illustrate that even when a person has come to thoroughly understand physical, sexual, or emotional abuse from one point of view, that person may still be unable to recognize or understand it in another context.

For this reason, I am a little hesitant to use the phrase ""emotional abuse"" to describe what Skylar is perpetrating against Walt because it doesn't fit most people's mental model of what emotional abuse looks like.

>Can you give some specific examples of when she does that, in addition to the credit card example? I think she's cold, aloof, dispassionate but I don't believe she's controlling or abusing him.

I can, but let's examine the credit card scene in more detail.

If a man were abusing a woman in this way, we might expect him to grab her purse, pull out her card, pocket it, and tell her with a sneer, ""you're too stupid to use this responsibly.""

This fits our mental picture of abuse because:

 He includes a physical component: taking her purse.

 He effectively cuts off her access to funds.

 He makes her feel bad by making a direct statement about her deficiencies as a person.

At the end of the credit card scene, Skylar has not used physical force against Walt, Walt still has access to the line of credit, and Skylar has not (to the best of my recollection) called Walt any names.

A reasonable person who has only encountered information about emotional abuse written from the perspective of a man abusing a woman might examine that scene and think: how on earth do Skylar's actions constitute emotional abuse?

To answer that question, it is necessary to look at the unspoken assumptions that underlie Skylar's statement in order to place it in context.

First, let's give Skylar the benefit of the doubt and assume that there is a good reason not to use that credit card. Suppose they had missed a payment in the past and are now paying the default rate on that card's balance. A financially prudent person would want to pay off that balance first to save money on finance charges.

There are a number of things that Skylar does not do before making her condescending statement to Walt:

She does not attempt to ascertain why Walt used that card. It is entirely possible that the other card with a lower interest rate was not accepted at the vendor where Walt made his purchase due to having a smaller network (e.g. Discover, AmEx, Diner's Club), or that it had been flagged and temporarily suspended by the issuing bank due to suspicion that the card had been stolen. Maybe the primary card number actually had been compromised and suspended legitimately. That would be a very important piece of information for Skylar to have, but she didn't ask about any of those possibilities.

Let's be even more generous with Skylar for a moment and assume that she is omniscient enough to know that none of these relatively common credit card related problems occurred.

Even then, Skylar does not attempt to ascertain why Walt used a higher interest card if he had a cheaper alternative. Maybe he was in a huge hurry and grabbed that card first. Maybe he was having one of his down days due to cancer and it didn't seem too important to him. Maybe he was buying her a surprise gift and was hoping he could get the gift to her before she noticed the charge on a credit card that she wasn't expecting to have to spend much energy reconciling.

But let's be even more generous with Skylar for a moment and assume that she is wise and perceptive enough to somehow know for certain that Walt does not have an intelligent, prudent, sympathetic or positive reason to have used that card.

Skylar expresses dissatisfaction with Walt's choice of card, not the expense of the purchase. With that in mind, let's suppose Walt made a $100 purchase on a card with a blisteringly high APR of 30%, that they have the resources to pay off the purchase by the end of the month, and that the card Skylar expected him to use had an industry standard interest rate of 13%. Let's further assume that the higher interest card has no grace period for purchases.

The difference of the APRs is 17%. Assuming it is compounded continuously (the most aggressive way, compared to monthly or daily compounding), that works out an extra finance charge of:

Pe^rt -P

= 100e^(17/1001/12) -100

~ 100e^(.01417) -100

~ 1002.718^.01417 -100

~ 101.43 - 100

= $1.43

Walt's putative mistake cost the family less than two dollars. Considering Walt is a mental math genius and Skylar has a firm grasp of finances, I would expect both of them to be able to figure this out to within a couple of bucks with very little effort.

Considering all of these points, what Skylar should have done was say, ""Hey Walt, I noticed a charge on the card we don't normally use. What's up?"" in a tone that communicates respect for him.

Instead, the message she sent was, ""Walt: you are stupid, morally weak, lacking in self discipline, thoughtless, and have only a tenuous grasp of arithmetic, especially as it pertains to money. I have no patience for how inadequate, shortsighted and pathetic you are compared to me. You should be ashamed of yourself."" 

From the article about emotional abuse:

> It can be more harmful than physical abuse because it can undermine what we think about ourselves. It can cripple all we are meant to be as we allow something untrue to define us.

This is exactly what Skylar is doing here. The art of Skylar's emotional abuse of Walt is that she can do it right in front of our eyes and fool people into merely labeling her as cold and aloof instead of severely emotionally abusive.

I believe that making Skylar an emotionally abusive person who beats down Walt's self esteem is integral to the plot. After Elliot and Gretchen offer to pay for Walt's treatment, he has to have a reason to continue cooking meth for the show to go on. Without Skylar steadily chipping away at his self respect throughout the show and likely through their years of marriage prior to the first episode, his pursuit of greatness as a drug kingpin wouldn't make as much sense.

"> do you think it's possible that people aren't uncomfortable around you, but you perceive it as that way because you expect them to be uncomfortable around you?

This is a REALLY good question and I really wish it had some upvotes.

Disclaimer: Sorry if my thoughts seem scattered on this. I kept adding more and more thoughts in the middle of other thoughts because I really wanted to give a thorough answer on your question. 

For one, when you are part of a particular group, whether it's social, ethnic, cultural, or sex, people tend to become 'hypersensitive' to things and issues that pertain to that group. You can sort of say that people are 'Tuned in' to when they are being treated differently because of being a part of that group (Mansplaining, talking slow to people with Asian accents, etc...). Especially if said group is minority (as in number of people vs other groups) in whatever environment that group exists in. White males living overseas in non-Caucasian countries would often experience the same thing. It's both a good thing and bad thing. But you're so used to people being uncomfortable that when they are instantly comfortable, it throws you off, and in some situations, makes you a bit nervous and wondering what the motive is, haha. 

Let me say it like this. The first time white people greeted me in a positive manner was in Versailles, MO when I was around or 6 years old. A white family waved when they drove by my grandmother's house and I freaked out and ran inside crying. I just wasn't used to that type of positive treatment from other races and didn't know how to handle it. That's when I got my first speech that there are many, many, good white people who don't view me in a negative way. A few years later, my closest friend was white and that also did a lot to alleviate many of my fears. It is VERY true that in our society, many are bred from childhood to mistrust others that are ethnically different from us. Others simply just don't have any exposure and therefore can't relate. 

As far as the good thing, in order to make things easier, I'm used to reading body language and sensing a person's comfort level and learning how to break the ice in said situations. Most of the time, because I'm 'well spoken', as some people like to point out, as soon as they hear my voice, even though it's deep, you will see many instantly relax as soon as they hear me and instantly no longer see me as a threat. It's both pretty funny to watch and somewhat bothersome, but you can't let things like that dwell, otherwise, you'll have a chip on your shoulder. Besides, most people don't do it intentionally or even realize they are doing it. It's just something that's ingrained in our minds from early on within this society and therefore a natural reaction. 

As far as the bad part, you have to constantly be on guard against yourself that you don't become somewhat bitter and bothered by society when experiencing it day in and day out. And then there's the more extreme and obvious situations that can pretty much shit on your entire week. But you just have to realize that the actions of a small percentage don't represent the the views of the entire race, and I think that's where one of the biggest disconnects in our society lies when it comes to diversity. 


> I mean, you live in Kansas city. I've never lived there. And I'm not a black male, so I really don't know what it's like, but do you think that it's possible that it's mostly in your head?

As I traveled around some of the states, it's DEFINITELY different. On the East and the West coastal areas, in many ways, many more people are used to being in a multicultural environment and you notice it right off the bat. At least in comparison to the Midwest and the South. Just depends on where you're at. I haven't been to Cali yet, but I've met plenty there who are just comfortable around other races. You notice it right off the bat. Here in the Kansas City area, you tend to see 'pockets' in various areas where people feel one way or another, but for the most part, people don't have outright hostile feelings. It's more of a subconscious thing. But this city did have a rampant problem with segregation in housing, and pretty much everyone knows that one of our streets (Troost) was the intentional dividing line between black and white neighborhoods and you still see the remnants of that down to this day.

> As I said already, any action taken by a god is either expected by statistics or is not possible. A natural god could exist that made the universe and did nothing else, but it would not be a wholly rational mind that believes this. They'd be right, but irrational.

Fine,

Global variables should be avoided and considered harmful in all but a few cases for the following reasons:

1) They can be edited by anything in your program, so they're difficult to debug how and where they change. Making your program unintuitive and difficult to grasp. Especially if it's not fresh in your head. 
2) It goes against one of the philosophies of OO programming, encapsulation. A global variable isn't encapsulated and cannot be reused.

This is problematic. Not only are you looking to are you looking to be ""100% sure"" on a very complex issue but you're also looking to come down on a particular side of it.

Both of these things are very dangerous.

For the former, the goal shouldn't be certainty, it should be new information and perspectives. Certainty is seductive, but unfortunately, when it comes an issue as complicated as abortion, being 100% sure of your stance is almost definitely a sign that you've oversimplified and/or misunderstood the issue. 

The latter is just straight-up bias. Impossible to avoid completely, but keep an eye on it and, most importantly, realize that just because you're aware of it and/or acknowledge it doesn't mean you can correct for it. In fact, if you ever feel that you've completely eliminated or accounted for it, that's the surest sign that you haven't.

I see your point, but I've always advocated taking the high road when dealing with unreasonable people (though I admit Notch's use of ""cuntplaining"" to counter ""mansplaining"" is absolutely hilarious). And let's not forget the media outrage over the POTUS's ""nasty woman"" gaffe.

"> I didn't watch the whole clip, I find this dishonest piece of shit just too annoying. The only good thing I can say about this guy is that I didn't see him parroting Nazi propaganda yet (but maybe I just missed it). 

It's ok, I could only make it 8 minutes in, and NAZI propaganda or even antisemitism wouldn't really surprise me at this point. The only reason I started wondering about the money thing 

>It's to me the most reasonable explanation that he's in for the money. But then again, I'd generally tend to assume it's more reasonable to expect a flat Earther is just acting instead of assuming that this utter lack of self awareness is real.

>In case of Jism it's not a secret that he's making directly some money (via patreon, for example) and I remember one case, where he was asking for funding for a weather balloon experiment and someone (I think it was Reds Rethorics) pointed out that he's been assessing ridiculous figures for certain things (like several $k for documentation on camera, Jism claims it's because he hired a professional team).

I agree. I first noticed he cared a bit too much about money when he started bitching about how he didn't make as much on patreon as other YouTube users. And yes, in my opinion, asking for way too much money for a project that will probably not happen (or at least will be lackluster) is a hallmark of fraudsters. 

>Additionally he had to admit mistakes and to ""correct"" his previous claims just too often and in consequence he's just pulling some new bullshit out of his ass (sorry for my language, I find this guy just particularly annoying). It just feels so obvious, that he didn't reach at his conclusions based on trying to figure out, how things are working, but rather because he's looking for a way to avoid admitting when he's wrong.

No worries about the language. He's a total asshole. He's so condescending and sure of himself it can make my blood boil lol. I think his mistake was when he actually started to do experiments. That is why he had to start retracting stuff, the same is true with Rob Skiba. If he wants to avoid admitting he's wrong, he needs to stick to making stuff up. 

>Awesome, I didn't know that channel and after watching for about 10 minutes I subscribed. I haven't watched the full video yet (definitely going to) but I can already tell that he's on spot and entertaining at the same time.

>The really sad thing is that in some places 2 (sometimes 3) publications are enough for a PhD (usually at least one as first author). So if you're cool with your Professor and you somehow manage to get a second person from the PhD committee on your side, you'll actually be able to get a PhD for publishing bullshit. So not only peer-review is not always a good criterion, academic titles can be a joke, too. Flat Earthers are not even so wrong...

Yeah, it can be a complicated mess. Potholer54 goes on in the video to talk about how the process is supposed to work, but it does not always go that way. I hope at least in the long run that stuff gets weeded out. 

Usually I drink Pilsner and Weizen from local breweries. One of my favorites which might just be popular enough that you could come across it in the US is ""Rothaus"".

I enjoy both Pilser and any kind of wheat beer, especially like now in the summer. I'll work outside and then come in and have a beer, so great. I have not heard of Rothaus, but I will look for it!

Reinheitsgebot is one of my favorite things about beer history. When I learned that I was like, ""Those guys are serious about their beer."" lol We call lemonade and beer ""shandy"" in the U.S. instead of ""Radler"". I agree that it can be a bit on the sweet side, but my wife prefers to drink it because it IS sweet lol. I haven't mixed lemonade and beer myself but that sounds like a good idea. 

>There's not too much foreign beer in the supermarkets or pubs. I do like Guinness and I also tried a few Belgian beers, they are having a broader variety of beers. The sweet stuff is not my favorite, but I like some of the other beers, particularly the darker ones. My experience with Beligian beer ranges from is this really supposed to taste like fermented apple juice to damn why don't they sell this stuff over here. They don't sell much Czech beer around here but as far as I can tell they are really good and young Germans often visit the Czech Republic for summer trips, because the beer's good and cheap.

For me, Guinness is ok. Although I heard the beer called ""Guinness"" that they sell in Europe is a totally different beer than what they sell in the U.S. I know what you mean about Belgian beers, I should have mentioned what I liked. I enjoy their wheat beers, lambics, dubbels, sasions, and trappist styles. Of course, even among these there can be large variations even within styles. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a framboise, they are waaaay to sweet. I like mostly Czech pilsners but I especially liked some of the beers from a company called Zatec. I'm not sure if you have had anything from them before. 

I don't really know many American beers, Budweiser is probably the most popular one around here. It's good, but it's pretty expensive and to me it's not that special that it would rectify the price. I tried a few American Lagers (don't remember the brands) to me they are missing something, I prefer a little more ""bitterness"". I recently had a ""Brooklyn Brown Ale"" in a restaurant, I even took a picture of the bootle to help me remember the name, that one was really good.

Again, for me Budweiser is ok. It's sort of moderate to cheep in the U.S., but I don't think it has a lot going on as far as flavor goes. I wonder if there are any differences in what is sold in the U.S. and Europe. Although Bud Lite is just terrible...a lot of the mainstream beer is not really that great. It's getting better, but some leftover prohibition laws didn't get repealed until the late 1970s. It was against homebrewing beer and it really hindered new breweries in my opinion. I feel like in just the last 5 to 10 years people have been opening up their palates. I also agree, some breweries are still getting their footing and a lot of beers seem to be missing something. I feel some breweries in the U.S. overhop beers that don't need it to compensate for that. 

Brooklyn Brown Ale is pretty solid, although I've only had it a handful of times. If you can find them, I'd recommend some beers from Sierra Nevada, Dogfish Head, Leinenkugel, New Belgium, Lagunitas, or Lost Coast. I could recommend specifics, but I have no idea what you can get your hands on! lol"

There isn't anything wrong with ignorance. Wilful ignorance is the problem. You choose to take my information as condescending. That isn't my fault.

> Brazil, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Nigeria and Mexico are among the world's leading meat producers.

Yes some humans would not benefit from an increase in plant consumption. However, many many more would benefit from plant based agriculture. 

""Brazil, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Nigeria and Mexico are among the world's leading slave producers. Poor slave owners who only sell slaves to the western world will surely not benefit from a slave-free world."" 

Sounds absurd right? 

Just because not everyone will benefit from something doesn't mean that something should continue.

This is exactly how inequality is created. You get into a position of power and you abuse the privilege at the cost of others.

No they don't. Most cows live on a diet of fortified soybean feed.

>The study team focused on weather stations that have been operating since 1950. They found that the ratio of record daily high to record daily low temperatures slightly exceeded one to one in the 1950s, dipped below that level in the 1960s and 1970s, and has risen since the 1980s. The results reflect changes in U.S. average temperatures, which rose in the 1950s, stabilized in the 1960s, and then began a warming trend in the late 1970s.


They excluded the last warm cycle of the PDO, wherein the record temperatures of the 1930's (which included the hottest year in the US- 1934, prior to the significant CO2 increase after WWII), to draw their conclusions.

>I'm not sure I understand this one. Are you wondering why Goenka did not allow students to use mantras or count the breath while seeking teachings/instruction from him? Clearly Goenka saw no need for such additional techniques.

That's what I mean. In the discourses, he says that using a mantra or an object to go with your breath helps one become more center-minded, but he is against it since it is not realizing the breath ""as it is,"" which becomes a distraction. In other theravada traditions, even one vipassana ones that are from burma/southeast asia, you are allowed count or note the in or out breath.. at least as a beginner. 

>You are not alone in having that feeling, I have gotten the impression that many people feel frustrated by the relentless simplicity of the teaching Goenka insisted on. If you want personalized teaching a Goenka retreat is not the place to look for it.

Lately, this is what I have been thinking.. it's too simple. It would be okay for simple-minded people who don't question things (and I mean this objectively.. I don't mean to be condescending); but I feel that many students, including myself, need to further understand why we have to do something before fully investing. I'm starting to branch out and look for other Vipassana organizations.. such as the thai forest tradition, which follows closely to what the buddha taught - perhaps even more than Goenka's tradition.

>That was/is simply Goenka's truth, that is what he sincerely believed/knew and it is why he did all the work that he did in order to spread his method of teaching around the world.

After my first course, I thought Vipassana meditation was specifically scanning your sensations from head to toe, toe to head. And this is what I mean; the information is lacking, so lacking that after speaking to some students it was brought to my attention that his scanning method is one among many Vipassana methods.

"Alright, let's do it by parts.

First, the recapitulation: u/Tarcolt started a thread about common pitfalls found in advice articles aimed at men, including accusatory tone and lack of empathy. Then, u/atomic_wunderkind commented that he felt the accusatory tone a lot, especially on ""letters to men"" around the internet (a feeling a sleight of other commentators on this thread also reported getting) and said that the root of the problem might be the fact that these articles are aimed more at women instead of at men. I agreed with this, and said that the concept behind the words ""virtue-signaling"" could help to understand what happened: while the ""letters to men"" u/atomic_wunderkind mentioned were ostensibly aimed at men, they were actually, consciously or not, more about repeating the right words and concepts to an in-group than about reaching out to men and empathizing with them.

Then you came and said the problem with virtue signaling was that anything could be called virtue signaling, and that it wasn't a good argument unless I could prove/show people were being hypocrites or acting in bad faith. I agreed the the words ""virtue signaling"" have been overused and badly applied, but still held that it was a useful concept, and that it could happen without any bad faith or hypocrisy on the part of the authors. In closing, I pointed out that you had elsewhere in the thread made an argument that required people to be acting like hypocrites or in bad faith and hadn't shown evidence of such, and so it was weird of you to demand a similar thing from me. Then you came in and managed to accuse me of being disingenuous, manipulative, using ad-hominem fallacy and making a bad faith argument, all in the span of... five lines, on my screen.

Ok. Now for the second part, your post:

>Declaring something as virtue signaling is to declare it a singular, self-centered, and hypocritical incident, and the one speaking as fundamentally selfish

Not necessarily. As I pointed out repeatedly before, parroting your in-groups beliefs and buzzwords back at them (which is what I am referring to as ""virtue-signalling"", here) is both a natural part of any social dynamic and often done without any conscious decision. It can be malicious, but not necessarily is. 

>standing up against injustice (in whatever form) is specifically an unselfish act

Again, not necessarily. Depending on the how and the when, it can be selfish. Doing armchair activism when there's a widespread societal awareness of some problem (And just to be clear, I'm not accusing anyone here of doing this, I'm just build a hypothetical) can be selfish. There's little to no risk to the ""activist"", and there's a strong probability of gain: being seen as a caring, engaged individual. Standing up to injustice at serious risk to oneself and in face of an apathetic society is another thing entirely.

>Sure those self-centered loudmouths exist and there are selfish loudmouths out there but to paint something you disagree with as such is very manipulative and degrading; it is a cleverly crafted ad-hominem attack

Except... I'm not painting anyone as a selfish loudmouth. I'm saying that some, not all, of those who write articles aimed at or about men and adopt a condescending tone and lack of empathy could do so moved by a probably subconscious drive to sprout the terms and thoughts of their in-group, and actually reaching out to men is secondary at best. 

Let me repeat just for the sake of clarity: I am not saying that everyone who wrote advice articles for men or posts titled ""men, we need to do better"" are selfish loudmouths maliciously lying to their audience in order to win cookies from their in-group. I am saying that, in some cases, it might have been a conscious or subconscious reason for why the tone in these articles often comes off, either condescending, lacking empathy, or assuming the worst about their audience.

>On top of that, ""having conversations about a topic with a group of people who agree"" isn't simply ""in-group performance"" at all- that is literally how we learn and refine our opinions

Obviously not. Thankfully, I'm not saying that ""having conversations about a topic with a group of people who agree"" is in-group performance. I am saying that ""ostensibly addressing/reaching out to the general public while at the same time using the concepts, shorthands, buzzwords and paradigms from your in-group"" can be in-group performance.

>RE: ""Gentlemen""
I don't have to back every damn statement up with hard data or evidence

Great! Neither do I. So I don't have to show how specific authors are acting in bad faith or being hypocrites in order to remark that virtue-signalling/in-group performance is a real, recognizable phenomenon!

>The other issue here is your demand for ""hard data which you will accept as accurate""

One, I didn't actually demand hard data from you. I simply pointed out that, the same way you can make off-hand remarks on a reddit forum and not back it up or demonstrate hypocrisy or bad-faith from the self-described gentlemen you claim are ""often passive-aggressive asshole Nice GuysTM"", I can also make off-hand observations and not back it up or demonstrate hypocrisy or bad faith from people that I believe may be partially motivated by a drive to ""virtue-signal"".

Two, I didn't put the ""which I will accept as accurate"" qualifier on my ""demand"" for hard data. My post is up there and can be read. This is you: a) putting words in my mouth; b) making assumptions about me and c) outright accusing me, again, of being malicious.

>Don't demand unreasonable burdens of proof as a way to dismiss a point just because you don't like the point.

Right back at you, mate. If you don't like my observation that people can and sometimes will just pander to their in-group while ostensibly reaching out to men, don't try to shut it down by claiming that I should show how people are acting in bad faith or that I should think of the impact on the observer (or whatever your point with the Thanksgiving dinner was).

>If you want to see examples of ""Nice GuysTM self-identifying as Gentlemen"", just go pull up /r/niceguys or any number of similar pages. Articles on the topic are equally common, all available through Google

And if you want to see examples of people ostensibly reaching out to men while simultaneously acting condescending and avoiding empathizing with them, just go up to TheGoodMenProject, if it still exists. Or DoctorNerdLove, which has been mentioned here already. Or go to Medium and look for publications aimed at men, like MEL Magazine. Or a number of other places.

">Yup, it's like a covert operation.

"As you said, we probably agree ;-).

My main point in a few short words: There's ""vegetarian"" and there's ""environmentally conscious vegetarian"". 
The former is about as cheap as eating your average meat (if not cheaper), the latter is much more expensive.

> Carbs in the way of bread, potatos and pasta can be got cheap but I'm not sure with the obesity issue we should be encouraging people to cut down on meat and overindulge on those [...]

> Most of the cheap alternatives to meat that you can name are probably not farmed ethically anyway so I have reservations about how big an impact a diet change would even be.

Well, we have to be fair here - we're talking in a post about cutting back on meat because of antibiotics. 
A healthy meat-less diet, ideally environmentally sustainable is definitely more expensive than just grabbing your frozen chicken - but so is a healthy, environmentally sustainable ""meat"" diet. 

That's exactly one of the points I wanted to make in my previous post: 

> you don't need 100% organically grown biological and environmental neutral ingredients

If you know how to cook and create meals using the cheapest beans, bulgur, lentils, etc. combined with rice, potatoes, pasta, etc. which people already do eat on a daily basis you should be as cheap or cheaper as buying the cheapest meat.

Going for ""meat replacements"" like soya puts you in the same situation as buying quality meat - they are on the pricier end of the spectrum. 

> I really don't like this idea poor people are entitled because they buy water-filled mass produced meat and microwave meals when doing their weekly shop. 

The ""poor people are entitled"" in my statement wasn't meant in a condescending way, it usually isn't a conscious choice for them but one out of necessity and ""uninformedness"" (calling it ignorance would have a negative connotation that I want to avoid in that statement). 

There was a time before meat was super cheap; at that time meat was a luxury good and poor people still found something to eat. What would you call it, if entitled isn't the correct word?

> There's a reason most vegetarians are from stable middle class homes.

We both agreed in our own words, that not eating meat is a luxury. I just say it is considered a luxury, you say it is a luxury.

We can probably discuss a lot of factors that influence that (time at hand to prepare meals, education & health consciousness, environmental consciousness, healthy lifestyle/diet in general, shrinking budget quota [of your total income] spent for food , etc.). 
What you should primarily consider is that most of these ""middle-class"" vegetarians also are very environmentally conscious which raises the prices a lot."

>Using the banning of a high profile streamer does not indicate internal mechanisms. Are there any known events of regular SR manipulators catching bans... in unaware of them?

I used the streamer's banning incident as an example but there are others who get banned all the time. Blizzard tends to ban in waves. They've made official statements about how they're cracking down even harder than in the past on these types of infractions. Purposefully and harmfully abusing the system is a bannable offense. There are cases in which a player may appear to be abusing the system when they are not. This is why so many of these situations pass an actual human investigation and cannot exclusively be relied upon by an algorithm to decide. Any algorithm used to help locate abusers is simply an aid to help find the real problem accounts.

>You were mistaken. I am fully aware of the definition of a smurf and don't really appreciate your condescension. You did not answer the question...

Again, wasn't trying to be condescending. I was just trying to clarify and my interpenetration of your statement lead me to believe that you may have been using it incorrectly. I was not trying to insult, only clarify. Past that, I did answer the question. I won't bother typing it all back out. You can re-read the subsequent three paragraphs following your question that I quoted above.

>I think I'm good here tho, your insights are your personal speculation of a pieced together code of conduct. Based on your tone I mistakenly assumed you had concrete info.

No one out side of Blizzard has any actual concrete info. I've stated and repeated multiple times how I gathered my information from official Bliz statements. It is personal speculation, as I've also repeatedly stated. Any argument anyone has as to how any of this works is based purely in their own personal speculation. I only aim to remind people, like yourself, who base any claim or accusation out of a singular assumption that there are other things at play. Even if we don't understand how they work in their fullest extent, we still cannot ignore the other facts we have gathered based on official Blizzard statements. 

So to say that Blizzard is encouraging boosting based on what they said to the guy they banned is an assumption based out of one statement from Blizzard when there are other statements, from Bliz, that contradict that mindset. So I maintain that it's incorrect to assume Blizzard is encouraging boosting just because they're banning a smurf. It's incorrect to assume Blizzard is encouraging boosting just because you can word it as ""playing with my friends."" A high rank playing with low rank friends is not exclusive to boosting. Twisting words and taking things out of context to justify some assertion that they're playing favorites or endorsing some kind of bad behavior is just plain wrong. It's wrong morally but it's also just a wrong assumption."

> This situation is merely a byproduct of how society interprets women as a whole.

I assume you're talking about the stereotypical gender stereotypes of men as brutish protectors, and women as meek, emotional beings. I don't think it's unreasonable for men to have an evolutionary urge to protect an upset woman. It is condescending and/or misogynistic to try to downplay those feelings, or attempt to buffer her from facts, thinking her incapable. It's a delicate line, and one that is often overstepped. In the instance of a woman crying during ticketing, intentionally or not, I suspect the cop would at worst simply not want to have to deal with the socially awkward situation.

> It’s creepy and scary when you’re stopped for a ticket and the clear aggressor/power-holder leers at you and then ‘pays’ for it by not giving you a ticket.

You argued previously that it doesn't matter if the woman consents, the system is still wrong. I agree, but I also think that it's a person's right to use/abuse their abilities as they see fit, so long as it isn't harming anyone else. You could, of course, retort that by using feminine wiles, a woman is hurting other women's social equality, but she might not be aware of that. Worse, she might be aware, but judge that her temporary individual situation is of a greater importance than that of the group, and move forward anyway. In either case, I suppose education is the only fix here, but good luck with that. People with privilege, no matter how slight, don't like to be told that they're privileged, and that they have a responsibility to respect that.

"> Exactly...all of these mention and focus on women in some way.

Only one of them arguably focuses on women. You also seem to have completely missed the topics ""men generally"", ""false rape accusations"", ""discrimination against men"", ""negative assumptions about men"", and ""fathers"", which are not only not about women, but don't mention them. 

Merely mentioning women is a major moving of the goalposts. That is not what you said. You said that we ""only talk about women 99% of the time"" and that there was ""so little actual focus on men"". 

Let's take a comparable look at feminism, using your new, altered, and unfair goalposts. If it's fair to expect the MRM to never mention women, it's fair to expect feminism to never mention men. 

Feminism says that we must dismantle the patriarchy, which is an organization of men that focuses on advantaging men over women. Manspreading, mansplaining, and manterrupting are words invented to describe and criticize men. The wage gap is about a supposed systematic advantage of men over women. Feminist complaints about representation are complaints that men are overrepresented compared to women. Feminist complaints about STEM fields are complaints that there are too many men and not enough women. What is the feminist slogan about rape? ""Teach men not to rape"". Why do they want people to say ""chair"" instead of ""chairman""? Because they don't like the man in charman. What other words don't they like? Postman, mailman, policeman. 

Man, that's a lot. By your standards, feminists ""only talk about men 99% of the time"" and there is ""little actual focus on women"". "

I would argue it's not that they're intentionally making things hard to understand, but that often an academic explanation assumes many concepts which are trivial to the academic but not to the student, making the explanation seem obtuse or unclear (sometimes even condescending).

It's like when I was new to programming. I found documentation impossible to use, because the definitions and examples assume you have basic familiarity with the syntax of the language you're working in and (to a large extent) programming in general. 

If you ask an academic to explain a complex concept to a layperson, their lack of knowledge about how deep your expertise goes makes it difficult to provide an answer which satisfies you (it's like that Feynman video about 'why' questions). 

Thus there is a constant tradeoff between trying to make your information as easy to understand as possible without being too patronizing.

That's hard as hell for us to do as well. It only works once you know the person REALLY well, and they already respect your opinion. Your Fe is above your Ti, so from a ""my point of view"" place, this would be harder to get a feel for. Because you are more receptive to the hidden implication behind tone/ delivery than the actual message and underlying motivations. So, for example, you trust someone's ""blank face"" being more expressive of their thoughts on a subject they're talking about. (When really, it could be the thing that excites them the most)

Not for TPs. Almost no matter the tone, we get the implication of the logic they're sharing before we consider the emotion being emitted. As a matter of fact, TPs are far more aware of scenarios where the reverse happens; someone who is very expressive and tries to be convincing in their tone and body language, but is spewing complete bullshit.

To us, it feels incredibly condescending. Like- REALLY condescending. To the point where in our minds, being an asshole but being fair is the best way to respect someone as an individual.

If you don't want to pretend to be mean- don't. It would just be confusing for both parties. Just don't say something you genuinely believe in sarcastically. The mean comments are meant to point out hypocrisy of whatever outlook you're parodying. The equivalent to ""hurr derr"" humour, but more nuanced and tickling core beliefs. Like how stupid racism or sexism is, or how retarded perpetuating stuff into petty drama is.

>How do I do that when they don't like talking about their feelings?

Soul searching for an INTP is like going from a fog to a nebulous state.

So basically, the thought process starts at ""I don't know"", and ends up at a more confusing but appreciative ""I don't know""

Be prepared to be frustrated, because even the most genuine and well-meaning beliefs end up going under the microscope of scrutiny. It's not by choice- it's just automatic. You say something, and we imagine the reverse scenario. So a response would start at ""Yeah...."" and fade into ""... but actually,""

Their mind is going from ""Let's take on your point of view, let's do this"" and then moving towards ""Is this a good point of view to have; where are the blind spots, where are the weaknesses, what causes this viewpoint to buckle""

So they'll seem harsh and dismissive to the unsuspecting. When actually, they're empathizing and trying to ""warn"" you of potential problems, despite how you might feel about receiving criticism then and there.

If you want to appeal to an INTP, your responses won't be judgemental towards the INTP's character. So if the INTP starts defending Hitler or Donald Trump, you can't say ""How come you think that?"" They don't think that. Other people think that, and they want to test to see how stupid it is. So naturally, you would either juggle both point of views, be open to hearing the opposing side (and know that they aren't actually holding that opinion, despite maybe starting to portray emotion for the first time in front of you about it), or follow along with the INTP rabbit trail and highlight paths they might be missing, or points they may not be considering.

I have a very high IQ, but my isolation from other people began long before I had any idea that IQ might be an issue, in fact I didn't hear about my IQ score until I was out of any kind of primary school for a number of years, because my parents kept the information hidden from me. 

My experience in education was that whatever advantage I had, it was not enough for anyone to find the worth in rewarding me for it, so even though I knew I was a bit smarter than normal, it was kind of a pointless joke that simply doomed me to spend eight hours a day doing this horrible school ritual because it was simply not legal for me to be left to run about in public. It was my experience that the people in the educational institutions in which I found myself spent a lot more time and effort trying to peg me with some kind of mental or behavioral disorder than any effort to find me some work that I could be interested in. 

Though, once I got to be about 14 or so I took the initiative to run around in public on my own anyway. When I had the chance, I took my high school proficiency exam and never regretted never having to go back, even though I pretty much lost all my chances to get merit scholarships for college.

Failing that, maybe arrange a movie night? Find some suitably sexy movies (Secretary is a personal favourite of mine), watch them together and talk about them afterwards. She might admit she found something hot and wants to try it - she might not.

"> Traditional or not, male sexuality is not expressed in a healthy manner by ""saving"" oneself for ""a girl"" who's ""worth it"".

Well why not? Are we still on the notion that we've gotta empty the old sperm tank every so often for the sake of health, and that nocturnal emission (or other automatic forms of emission, e.g. suddenly when just sitting there on the toilet) has no place in the sexual functioning of men? Or are we speaking on ""expressing your sexuality"" as whatever you feel at the present moment no matter who it's with? Either way, both would be misleading. ""The one girl who's worth it"" may be a little condescending of a term, and I think a more accurate representation for the abstinent male should be ""giving my all for the one who means all to me"". Regardless, some people know sex in their lives as inevitable and want to make that realization possible in the most beneficial way for their relationships. And on it being ""tough to pull off"", that doesn't have to be true if you know what your priority is in life. After all, we all thought there was nothing to Nofap or that masturbation was completely healthy, who knows what else you could be proven wrong about when it comes to sex life. "
"> i just cant ever like, talk about it, you know? without getting mocked.

This is exactly why it needs to be talked about. That attitude of ""feminism is worth mocking"" becomes reinforced if we shut our mouths and let the idea fly by. The point in them mocking the idea is to make us stop talking about it. Therefore, if we let the fear of mockery overcome the desire to discuss it, we are letting them win.

So here's some tips for discussion: if you're in a casual context and if someone you talk to is likely to mock you, then the best thing to do would be to reconsider whether you really want to be around that person anyway. There are plenty of people out there, both male and female, that either already hold these ideas, or that would be willing to listen to a new perspective.

The key is to be comfortable in your ideas and in your surroundings. Seek out curious and open-minded people. I do, and our conversations can wander all over the place, including into feminism. If you are casual, comfortable, and respectful of others' ideas, you will be much more likely to get people thinking about your own ideas later on. Rarely do people change minds in the middle of an argument and admit they were wrong, so don't engage in hot-headed arguments. When people are arguing angrily, they're too busy feeling offended and defensive to take in any of what you may say. Becoming aggressive about your point will turn people off from listening to you.

Instead, have a calm discussion and listen to their side (no matter how disgusting it is) before responding with your own points. It will make them feel like they aren't being judged or condescended to. Keeping respect goes a long way toward getting somebody to consider what you've said. Even if someone decides to take offense at such a crazy idea as ""equality,"" refusing to escalate the matter by staying calm and even-tempered works in your favor: bystanders are likely to think your position has more value because you didn't jump into a knee-jerk fit when somebody challenged you. It makes the other person look more foolish for blowing up and, if they reflect back on the event wondering why it bothered them so much, then bam, you've even got the defensive guy thinking about it. Staying calm is a win-win for both you and the cause you're discussing. This is especially important for a topic like feminism, since it already has the stereotype of being followed by ""hysterical, irrational"" people.

The important thing to take note of before beginning these sorts of discussions is to determine if the context is appropriate. At work with a crowd of different people? Probably not a good idea."

But, for myself, I found it a limiting labeled because I didn't like the dogma it entailed.

"> active, believing, orthodox members.

I don't think this is accurate. We have lots of unorthodox people, even some of them are mods. It's not that people can't post contradictory thoughts. We have lots of threads that discuss things that are factual, historical, or controversial. The problem is when people post from their bias that the church is wrong or cultish or whatever.

Exmormons, just like Mormons, have their biases. Most of the time, people come in and probably don't even realize how awful or condescending or disparaging they sound. Here's some samples from our recently removed comments:

 Congrats. Don't let your children alone in a room with anyone from the church.

 apparently, critical thinking doesn't get any time here.

 Can any rational human being, no matter how strong their ‘testimony,’ believe that this is remotely possible.

Some of these were the whole comment. Some are part of a larger comment. 

You could look at these statements and just say, ""Oh, those Mormons don't want us to hurt their precious feelings."" But that's the problem. It's not about our hurt feelings. It's about how the nature of the conversation changes when one party dismisses the other without regard.

I see posts here all the time where someone's TBM family member was rude or dismissive or something. It's the constant refrain of ""they just want to sin/were offended/are lazy/didn't look hard enough for answers"" but in reverse. We don't want to be told that we are brainwashed or dumb or lacking critical thinking or gullible or whatever else.

I honestly think that many, if not most, exmormons don't even realize how their verbiage might be construed. There's obviously some who know exactly what they are doing, but I think most are good intentioned.

So, yes. Come and talk about Kinderhook Plates or Fanny Alger or multiple First Vision accounts or the Spaulding manuscript. Just do it from a place that isn't assuming that we aren't aware of the issues or too stupid to know why we're wrong. "

"Part 1 (of 2):

If you'll permit a Catholic to attempt to address some of your complaints...

> Funnily enough, the topic of papal infallibility, which I am told at certain times ALWAYS applies, and when questioning it that is SOMETIMES applies, wasn't even something until 1869, in which it was declared under infallibility that the Vatican was now infallible.

The authority of the Pope has been held by the Catholic Church since long before 1869. The recognition of a doctrine or dogma by the Church is not the same as saying that they made it up right then. For example, the Immaculate Conception was not defined as a dogma until 1854. But that doesn't mean that Church Tradition (and this would go back even to pre-1054 East-West Schism) never held to the Immaculate Conception. Point being, just because something is defined specifically at a certain point, doesn't mean that the belief wasn't held prior to that. The declaration just seeks to clarify.

>Whenever someone in the church is confused about a topic, or the have a question, both the priest and the members are pretty helpless. More than once, whenever I tried to speak to the priest at moments of spiritual crisis, I was given a one or two sentence cliche response, told to pray 3 hail Mary's and shown the door. Just the other day at confession I told the priest of the doubts I was having and all he could say was that the RCC has been around 2000 years.

Unfortunately that's the case in every Church. Some people just aren't good at explaining the faith. Sometimes that's because they don't know enough about it. Sometimes it's an issue with the question being asked. Sometimes people just have a bad day. But just because Fr. Joe Smith is a bad confessor doesn't mean Fr. Stan Smith is too. I've had great confessions that lasted 2 minutes. I've had awkward, unproductive confessions that lasted much longer.

>When something is asked among laypeople, the question often turns into a round of finger pointing and a competition of holiness.

I don't know that this is always the case. Sometimes, maybe, but again - some people aren't good at explaining matters of faith without tooting the ""Catholics are the best"" horn. I fall into that trap sometimes, despite any best efforts I can put forward. And, some people are just condescending. That's not going to go away just because you're not attending a Catholic church anymore. There are probably lots of hard-headed Episcopalians who are just Episcopalian because they've always been Episcopalian.

>but usually calling your brothers and sisters heretics doesn't help them develop their faith.

I don't recall anyone ever calling you a heretic... That said, if you go into r/Catholicism and ask people about something related to Catholicism, you'd sort of expect them to respond with mainline Catholic teachings. ... beyond that, and without knowing your particular questions, I can't be of much more help.

>Also ask a question regarding church teaching and the response is always a 10 page manuscript of canon law written in purposely vague terms.

Again, if you're asking a question about Church teaching, you'd kind of expect an answer from Church teaching, right? ... with regard to vague terms: it's a law. Civil laws, just like Canon law, is written with sufficiently broad language so as to make it effective. What would be the point of writing a law that only applies to one case in a million? The purpose of laws is to enshrine a particular goal or rule or belief, etc., and to actually be able to apply that law.

>The source for belief in the Catholic church always turns out to be the Catholic church.

That's not really the case. The source for belief in the Catholic Church is rooted in Scripture - Jesus established a church, prayed that it be one, gave the Apostles the authority to forgive sins, to teach in His name, to bind and loose, and gave Peter the keys. That's the basic formula for the Catholic Church.

>Makes me wonder how solid a certain belief must be when we need to refer to a 30 or 40 page document to explain it.

Again, think of civil law. The Constitution has things written down in it. Courts have spilled gallons of ink on thousands of pages on short little sentences in the Constitution. And that's just in 200 years. Now multiply the number of people who are Christian, times the number of passages in the Bible, times all the things people can think about the Bible.

Or think of academia. A doctoral dissertation is hundreds of pages long. How solid can that be if it needs hundreds of pages?

>Hell the other day I disagreed with a Catholic brother/sister at r/Catholicism over the dangers of intertwining the church and the secular government and I was called a heretic for disagreeing with a heresy declared in the early 1800s aptly called ""Americanism"".

I didn't see that thread, so I can't speak to the specifics of what was said.

>I was told that Catholics are discouraged from reading and interpreting scripture.

Again, I didn't see the thread specifically, but as a general note, that's simply not true, and if someone said it, they're flat wrong. Catholic churches have Bible studies just like any other Church. We have certain interpretive guidelines, sure, but so does everyone else, when you think about it.

Sorry to beat you over the head with another American legal reference, but consider the Constitution. The Supreme Court is the final arbiter of constitutional issues. People can debate, and disagree, and talk about, and read the Constitution and laws all they want. But ultimately someone has to make a decision about what goes beyond the bounds of reason. That's the function of the Magesterium.

>I think it'd be just dandy for the church if we were all illiterate again and disallowed from ever opening a Bible then.

Just as a historical point, you say this as though there wasn't discussion or debate regarding Scripture when literacy was an actual issue. I mean, the Ecumenical Councils debated issues where people disagreed and it was done between people who could read. The reason people commonly didn't read the Bible was because there was no easy way to do so until Gutenberg. Making a Bible was a very time consuming process, and a very expensive process, so Joe Commoner couldn't just walk over to his nearest book store and grab his preferred translation of the Bible."

For constructive criticism to work, there needs to be a dialogue and once more, in my experience DE has gotten progressively worse at having that dialogue over the years and seem to care less as the years pass, Warframe being a F2P game saves them a lot of hassle, they can say the game is still in beta thus avoid anything remotely looking like accountability and they can implement things that are unpopular with the community.

"> I see what you did there. You cut out all the text in the middle that said women should get extra consideration over men.

No, simply pointing out the parts of my statements that you had selectively decided to ignore, which make it clear it's ""not just because of gender"", but a variety of societal issues and contexts that need to be considered. Yes, many of them are tied up in the way our society handles gender. We in the Magic community can't do anything about the fact that women are overall exposed to a lot more harassment from men then other men are, but we can account for that when interacting with them in the community.

> I do treat everyone nicely, and I do stand up for anyone who seems like they are being made uncomfortable

Good! Then you're ostensibly not part of the problem! I'm talking about men who are aggressive to those around them, and people who see that aggression and wave it off because they think they'd be okay being on the receiving end of it.

And maybe they would be, because they're confident in their own safety and they enjoy trash talking, with the aggressor in question or in general. Because of external social contexts, it is much more likely that a given woman is going to feel unsafe with a given level of aggresion from a man, especially if they're in a room of other men who are laughing along with the aggressor. Women are also more likely to be conditioned to use avoidance rather than challenging the aggressor as a resolution tool. Females are often taught that, when confronted with an aggressor or potentially unsafe male, they should not do anything that could potentially provoke the aggressor or draw attention to themselves, to avoid risking physical or sexual attacks. Males are frequently taught that the way to deal with an aggressor is to ""stand up for yourself"" and escalate the situation even at the risk of your safety if you have to. Women are typically taught to appease or run away, and to avoid going places alone if they can help it.

I'm telling people that maybe they should take a pause from joining in with what appears to be friendly trash talk and really attempt to evaluate whether the recipient is actually enjoying it or just smiling and nodding to avoid making the situation worse. It's not unfair treatment to maybe do that check twice if the recipient is a woman, just because they're less likely to be confident in their safety in such a situation, and because it's less probable that she'll respond to a situation with slightly lowered safety than a man would.

> ...far more annoyed with the ""special consideration"" given to them because of their gender than any kind of harassment they experience.

Maybe that's because the ones experiencing harassment don't feel comfortable talking about it in contexts where you're around, for instance if this is happening in the store where the aggressor and/or his friends are present, or because many discussion areas, this sub included, aren't always the most supportive places when these issues come up. There could be a reason the girl in this story didn't post to /r/magicTCG instead of or alongside /r/TwoXChromosomes, besides wanting opinions from a wider pool of women.

As for myself, the sort of ""special consideration"" I've heard women complain about regarding these sorts of events are when a guy is ""nice"" to the point of being creepy--really more interested in hitting on her than being friendly, which only serves to make her feel less safe. On the other hand, I've chatted with a couple of women at my LGS's draft night who were still flustered by how a man was talking down to her, or getting more visibly angry when she beat him.

[Note: This is going to break away from our particular argument a bit, back into the general discussion about ""why say women? you should say all people!]

As much as you seem to hate the fact that this thread deals with a specific warning to treat women correctly, there are a nontrivial number of men out there who treat women worse than they treat men, in society overall and in the Magic community. They're more likely to be condescending or creepy, or hostile to a woman than to another man, and in my experience, the hostility directed at a woman can often carry more bile and sexual overtones than when that same person is angry at a man.

This gap in treatment is compounded by the fact that the other men in the room are often rather accepting of the creepiness (""he's just flirting! You were probably being a tease."") or condescension (thinking ""we"" can't blame him for guessing she didn't know how to play; girls don't typically play magic/video games/read comics after all). The same even happens with hostility. I've heard, with my own ears, a woman tell her opponent not to call her a bitch only to have the guys around her saying crap like ""oh get over it. Nobody would care if you called him a dick after all.""

When women bring these complaints up, they are often waved off as above; told either that they shouldn't be offended or that it's probably something they did. We care more about the person's right to call someone a bitch than her request not to be called a bitch. When a particularly bad complaint comes up after the fact, we question why she didn't complain then and there instead of now, and we throw doubt on the story before we're willing to discuss how we can stop similar problems, deciding ""nobody really does that"" and arguing over whether she's lying for attention instead of acknowledging that we've all seen similar issues, even if not this blatant.

I agree that we should all treat everyone nicely. Frankly put, I see lots of men who are otherwise nice to other patrons treating women noticeably less nicely, and receiving no negative repercussions from his peers. There is a real problem with men not applying the same standards of conduct in their socialization with women as with men, and the fact that this gap in treatment is so long lived and pervasive points to the idea that we're not even consciously aware we're doing it and seeing it. The solution to that sort of unconscious acceptance is to point at the gap explicitly and tell people to put special effort into examining whether they're subconsciously accepting a gap in standards in a given situation.

As I said up near the top, people don't step in when they think they'd be okay being on the receiving end, but the answer to that is often based on that implicit gap in how we handle people based on gender. Seeking gender equality isn't demanding that we change all instances of ""Harassing women"" to ""Harassing people"" in warnings. It's seeking to remove our need to point out that women need to be treated well as well, and our need to put a bit more thought into whether we need to step in to a situation."

">Your comments show that you pretend to be knowledgeable at linguistics.

I'm sorry you've gotten that impression. When I make definitive statements, it's always about stuff I am knowledgeable about (often my own dialect). Again, if you were more careful in your snooping, you'd find that I also ask a lot of questions and hedge my answers a lot. ""Pretending to be knowledgeable"" is definitely not my goal.

>Wrong.

No, right. Go to /r/linguistics and ask them what linguistics is. It's not just ""learning lots of languages"".

>They must be fluent at the language that they study unless they study their own languages. [emphasis added]

Which many of them do. Even among those that don't, it's not uncommon for them to only be fluent in two languages. If you doubt any of these things I'm saying, talk to the actual linguists over at /r/linguistics.

Who cares what other kids think? all kids think and say bad things to their classmates, this isn't any different. muslim kids are already eligible for bigotry just because they're muslim or have muslim sounding names.








And why should all kids do the same? why is conformity such a big thing? where is the enlightenment spirit of the europeans?









>It will result in a cultural clash, as we can see it.





it's not the problem of muslims, it's the problem of people in switzerland or other similar countries who believe in values of individuality and freedom etc. and then they go against them when such values open a public space for values or behaviour they disagree with. European society has been changing for 300 years and people were open to it especially in recent decades, but those changes are spearheaded by white people so it's fine, they can eventually identify with them. But when changes suggested by other ethnicities or religions even if these new changes aren't even addressed to the mainstream, these changes become condemned and rejected out of hand.






These new people entered those countries with the invitation of the host families and the desired integration was initiated by their governments. So these governments should take the responsibility for their policies. Identity isn't just ethnic food and unintelligible songs, it's also cultural practices, religion, values and art etc. Governments shouldn't pick and choose what these people keep and what they leave behind unless it's illegal. if they keep condescending attitudes towards their minorities then they'll push them even further

">Long answer, it makes life harder. You repeat classes in college because you didn't learn to program well enough and the exercises tripped you up. It's harder to find a job out of college because you did the bare minimum to get a degree, may have to work unrelated jobs that incrementally approach development.

Sounds like me. I think I would have made a better coder coming into it with a journo or PolSci degree rather than a ridiculously hard computer engineering one that had me in a ""fail, repeat, scrape through"" loop for more than 6 years. Finally got out with a shitty bachelors degree when I was nearly 27. Granted, I don't enjoy coding for a living and am only working in IT. Still - it would have been easier to learn without all the compulsory Java, ridic high expectations and condescending peers (not all of them). "

"> As others have pointed out, the Macintosh OS has a much closer relationship with the mouse than Windows. The mouse, despite inevitable droning about the number of buttons, is a much more considered input device on the Macintosh - for instance: spring-loaded folders, windows becoming key and moving into position when items dragged over them, and Exposé.

Indeed, the mouse is so entrenched in the mac that if it fails, your computer becomes a sitting duck. At least with Windoze, you can have keyboard shortcuts to EVERY menu function. Including shutdown.

Not so on the mac. If you mouse dies, you can’t even turn-off the machine properly!

Way to go!

> To enhance the ability to multitask with a mouse (rather than keyboard shortcuts) windows must not be full screened. Full screen applications completely remove all possibility of easy multitasking with the mouse. To a great degree it's true that with fullscreen apps: Other windows peeking out can't be clicked and brought the the front, files can't be dragged in from the desktop, etc.

This is the lamest explanation I have ever seen for a quite obvious shortcoming. 

Often, you need to see as much as possible in the current window, hence maximize it. Denying it and forcing one to manually move both corners of the window is plain stupid, and if done consciously for X, Y, or Z reason, is condescending and insulting to the intelligence of users.

">But they do have particle shields as a main. Wookieepedia says that bigger ships (like destroyers) have both types of shields. It does say that any object that is slow enough will go through the shields though.

the big ships do have the particle shielding, but primarily in the same fashion that I've listed. Mostly in key areas like the bridge, fighter bays, engineering sections, and in some cases the citadel itself.

>I mean, sorta... They can vaporize steel doors, grates, and sizeable chunks of walls. I know that a lasgun can blow off an arm, but flesh doesn't have the same density as concrete/steel, and we've seen how much crap an E-11 can melt through. Granted, we've never seen someone get hit at this power level, so I like to think that an E-11 and Lasgun are roughly equal.

If the E-11 actually did manage to do most of those things to people, including limb removal then it'd be completely equal. While I'm not saying the E-11 isn't deadly, it's still not as powerful as a lasrifle. Lasrifles do the same things you listed, only with more boom booms, they can put a 0.6 meter deep hole in what is basically concrete on steroids (ceramite infused), and melt stuff too. Biggest advantage is the higher accuracy however. 

>Based on what metric? I know that the Imperium has some pretty crazy tech, but most of their stuff is pretty basic. I know that their pre-heresy battleships and stuff are top-notch, but those are few in number and most of their stuff isn't close to their old levels.

let me put it this way, the main turret of a sword class frigate, has ammunition 6x longer than the thickness of star destroyer armor. They utilize lance weaponry as well in the form of heavy prow lances. 

And that's JUST the frigate, which I must add is about 1.3x the length and a whole measure more of mass of a Star Destroyer. 

No tech in the Imperium is ""Basic"", It'd take too long to list off all of the technology, but I'm going to focus on three vital points for now. 

VOID SHIELDS - These are not like the shields of conventional science fiction. The void shields act as translocators, translating items and energy into the warp. It's not the power of the weapons which bring the shields down, but the volume and durration of said weapons. This is why lance weapons are so potent against void shields, they force the ship to translate longer so the capacitors drain faster. Of course the other reason weapons are so powerful is so that they can do massive damage to the ship in the few seconds the void shields are down, and they need that damage too if they're to burst through tens of meters thick armor. Star Wars weapons wouldn't likely be able to output enough firepower to bring down the first layer of void shields, much less actually punch through the armor....and that's assuming optimal conditions where they aren't being one shotted left and right. 

LANCE WEAPONS - Not only do these out range star wars weapons (sense of accuracy here, as shit usually goes on forever in space) but they also hit vastly harder. A single gothic cruiser could probably destroy 100-300 star destroyers in a few minutes, from far far out of range of the star destroyers. Lunar class cruisers could also probably weigh in here, especially as they're the most numerous cruisers. Macrocannons are also extremely long range and accurate as they're basically super compact railguns, but most usually use them for broadsides (please note that most wikis and even the lexicanum speak of 40 kilometers, that's meant for the ground to space variant which they usually picture)

ARMOR - The armor alone on these warships are at a minimum of 10 meters thick, with cruisers having 10-30, battlecruisers (depending on variants) 10-20, to 20-50 meters thick, Battleships with 40-80 meters thick for ONE layer, and they do have numerous layers. 

There are dozens of other key factors and tech which would shread the star wars universe, but these three are the most basic. There's also the fact that the hacking capabilities of the mechanicus are vastly higher than what star wars has, and we're not talking about the forbidden skrapcode. 

The Star Destroyers would make excellent ramming ships if they manage to successfully defect to the imperium. Reinforcing their superstructures with puncture points of ceremite and iron could see them as hundreds of tyranid invasion buffers. Kinda like the lusyanka and the world ship...that was a heartbreaking moment for me, but also an uplifting one. 

>Mars has a ton of old crazy shit as well, but do they ever deploy it on a large scale?

oh yea, hells yea they do. Not only are there Explorator fleets out there, but the mechanicus itself does maintain its own fighting force, including its own navy. Granted the majority of mechanicus ships are forge ships, which usually tend to hive worlds, but they also co-opt numerous pre-existing designs and retrofit them for themselves. We're not talking an entire navy of Speranzas, but definitely top notch weapons.

"Great post. I trust you and all, but the dailymail is not a good source. In fact its generally a bad source.

With criminalizing tobacco products with the intent to end smoking, I am not sure thats how it works. In fact, Portugals last 10 years suggests that decriminalizing everything, including hard drugs, is better. With needle drugs, offering clean needles for free/cheap is great, because of things like Hep and AIDS. Canada just launched a vending machine for crackpipes, but I am not sure if there is a lot of spread of disease through pipes. With drugs like marijuana, taboo is a big factor. If something is illegal, its all the more ""cooler"" and/or ""hipper"". Marijuana is so overrated, its ridiculous. But I don't see marijuana as a major problem. Alcohol is far more damaging to society, with drunk driving, spousal abuse, general violent shenanigans.

>Including stripping otherwise productive members of society from their family and friends to prop up the for profit prisons systems and mitigate their losses during a period of lost revenue from declining incarceration of other non violent drug offenders

That is such an unfamiliar view that I honestly don't know if you are joking or not. Please don't take that to mean anything condescending, just that I haven't really heard that view before.

">it's definitely targeted at the rural south of the United States.

Why? Who is being dehumanized in the south? Where? What culture war? Have you ever lived there? Let me put this into perspective: I was born and grew up in the rural south, and I've never seen the amount of small-minded clannishness, bigotry and racism anywhere in the south that I've seen in spades from Europeans. Go to any southern rural college town and see if you can find that culture war.

Obama getting a standing ovation by Canadian MPs has nothing to do with how Americans are regarded. Of course everyone loved Obama as a political figure, he was a likable guy, but he wasn't some amazing, uniting force in the US or even around the world. Several times European leaders felt he was condescending. Remember Syria and his famous line in the sand that he drew and no ally would back him, forcing him to renege? He spoke well and was a nice guy, but don't conflate high regard for Obama as a person with high regard for the US or Americans. Obama didn't stop Americans from getting scowled at abroad and made to feel like they had to apologize for things they weren't responsible for.

And yes, anti-Americanism was just as bad under Obama. It's not like people liked us all of a sudden. There was a honeymoon period of about a month after his election, but that was just because he was the first black man elected president. I saw this with my own eyes because I was abroad during his entire presidency.

This past weekend, for example, at a concert after the show, talking with a really cool Swedish guy working with the band. Asks me about my history, why I'm here, etc. We start a good conversation, share many of the same ideas, really cool vibe, lots of back-slapping and finishing each other's political sentences. Really sharp guy and really interesting to converse with. Right up until the part where he got ahead of himself and said the world would be better off if the US and everyone in it just sank into the ocean and died from the rising waters of global warming (I guess because it's all our fault?), that only then would the world be able to start fixing itself. 

Yeah. 

The funny thing is, he caught himself as soon as he said it. I could almost hear what he was saying to himself in his head: ""Why did I just tell this nice American fan that his country would be better off at the bottom of the ocean?"" I thanked him for the company and left.

I couldn't tell you how many times I've experienced this situation. This is what we deal with every day. What you said about just being disappointed in the US is a really nice sentiment. Really, it is. But it's just not true. It's not just criticism anymore; we are hated, and when you take that hostility and point it at us, we feel threatened. That's why Trump got elected, and it's also why I'm kinda afraid he may get re-elected. What you don't understand is Americans have felt betrayed by their allies for the last 30 years or so, but they swallowed it for the greater good. They can't take any more, and Trump is tapping into that anger and frustration by proposing these bad ideas which just exacerbate the situation. 

Sorry, I got a little carried away and ended up on a tangent."
"> there is no such thing as a stabilizer muscle that is better worked on barbell squats vs smith squats. The dif is neurological 

I don't intend to sound condescending, but are you seriously claiming that e.g. abdominals and back would be under equal stress in both smith squats and barbell squats? 

 Smith squats: the bar moves on rails that go directly up and down, no wobbling or tilting of the bar possible, no need or even possibility to stabilize the weight; the only direction you can go is up or down.

 Barbell squats: the bar sits on your back, absolute freedom of movement in all directions at any given moment. You have to hold the bar in place, you have to keep it balanced. 

I don't see how stabilizer muscles wouldn't be worked more on barbell squats than smith squats. And of course the difference boils down to the nervous system, because that is what operates the muscles in ways that the body has been taught to. Barbell squatting teaches the body to handle free weights that require balancing and extra work from the secondary muscles to much greater extent than squatting in 2D plane of motion which does not require balancing or effort for stability.

> Just because you use your lats and arm muscles on squats and deads doesn't mean they're getting trained.

Squatting isn't going to give you a huge back or arms, but claiming that deadlifts wouldn't train your lats is simply false, especially if you know how to use the lats for deadlifting. There is no debating that. But yeah, lats and arms are irrelevant for this discussion because they were just examples of secondary muscle groups that you asked me to list, and I explained why I can be ""serious"" about bringing up lats and arms in regard to squatting. You ask me about lats and arms and then you say they're irrelevant...

"> Is your goal to get policy enacted or to frame things in a way that you like?

The goal is to get meaningful change and achieve societal respect as well. Straight white cismen do not know what it is like to live as a woman or as a minority. 

Do you realize how condescending you sound in all of these examples?

Historically speaking progress in social movements has been achieved by coupling political activism with social activism. The Mattachine Society never really got much traction in their goals of advancing gay rights in the pre-Stonewall era. Once Stonewall happened everything changed because we were taking to the streets and getting in y'all's faces and choosing to no longer be victims of your oppression. Only once that started happening did y'all finally start conceding to our demands for equal rights and treatment.

Again my point is that historically groups that have engaged in identity politics are groups whose voices have not been heard in the national conversation. That's why we band together. So if a straight white cisman is put off by an apparent disregard for his opinions in certain progressive groups it is likely because he doesn't have a dog in the fight. 

He is perfectly capable of wanting a decent society and wanting to see change sure, but he isn't personally affected by those groups issues. If he feels like he isn't valued there, he should try to be a good ally and listen and try to act in such a way that he helps the group to accomplish their goals rather than trying to direct that group."

I've also seen a lot of pro-Octavia posts on Reddit and Youtube and Twitter. Do you call those people out too ? No, you don't because they share your opinion. So it doesn't bother you. Sounds a bit hypocritical, doesn't it ?

Also, like u/Mimi_BTS and u/rosisergio said, it's not wrong to dislike her. You don't get to say what's the wrong or the right idea. You don't get to tell people what they have to think. You know what's wrong ? People who dislike Lexa because she's lesbian or Monty, Indra, Bellamy and others because they're not white (and believe me, I've seen that, unfortunately). Not liking your fave, especially when this fave is depicted as the villain this season, is not wrong. Even Marie said she was worried people might hate Octavia. They knew that would happen. There are so many valid reasons to hate her. Now, you can call out those who are being disrespectful, insulting or condescending with you because you like Octavia. That behavior is wrong.

We all think differently, watch the show for different reasons, love different characters, feel different emotions when we watch 'The 100'. You don't have to agree with those who don't like her, just like I don't have to agree with those who like her. We can all debate about that and respect each other's opinion, can't we ?

Your claim, verbatim, was ""BLM demonstrators are violent and obnoxious"" yet I'm somehow nitpicking and misrepresenting you to interpret that to mean BLM demonstrators are violent and obnoxious.

This is just the slimiest attempt at ""no u"".

>You keep saying that I'm ""pivoting,"" but that implies I'm going away from the topic that was initially presented. As I've shown before, everything I've said has been relevant. You're nitpicking.

You're pivoting when you move from ""They're VIOLENT and OBNOXIOUS!!1! SHOW ME ONE DEMONSTRATION THAT HASN'T GONE THIS WAY"" to ""hey mayb the violence is rare but some of em have signs that hurt my feelings and i dont like it"".

At least acknowledge that you're abandoning your original argument to argue something else. Don't pretend you were right from the start.

Nobody said they don't exist you spoon. I said this in my first comment

It really doesn't.

>My research suggests that there exists a significant portion of the left that is accurately represented by Shapiro's arguments and counterarguments, especially when it comes to social justice.

Your research consists of googling for terms that will bring up disagreeable content (""Cherry picking? I just searched ""manspreading"" in Google just for kicks and giggles"") and watching videos (""I don't need anybody to tell me anything when I can just watch videos of protests and counter-protests."").

Neither of these gives you an idea of the prevalence of anything.

Googling ""manspreading"" isn't research to counter the claim that Shapiro picks the bottom 1% of occurrences to attack.

>Why is it wrong for me or Shapiro to claim certain things if nobody disagrees that they exist? This seems like a pointless attack on my argument.

Because nobody is arguing about whether or not these people exist, as I have stated multiple times. You seem to have forgotten you said ""and then he applies it to the whole of the left""

Not the same concept only because in feminism in the west vs feminism in the east, one needs it and one doesn't.

Feminists now are fighting for laws placed against men who spread their legs too far, and men giving informed feedback whilst women are involved in the conversation at hand (mansplaining). They claim they want equality, but if a man defended himself against a physically abusive woman, they'd attack the man like wolves. They claim they want equality, but none of them give a shit about men who kill themselves, the lack of male domestic abuse shelters, the 99% of sanitation workers being men, or that male genital mutilation is still legal

"He did run away when Wilson started shooting. Even the police said that. And just because ""every bullet hit from the front"" doesn't mean Wilson didn't shoot and miss. And, I might add, one of the entry wounds on his arm accoding to the coroners report might have come from behind. 

>No one says he was running away except for his best buddy, who also said he was shot in the back.

Everybody said that he ran away. They just disagree on the specifics of what happened when he stopped and turned around. 

> and condemning this is wasting time and effort that could be better used condemning real bad cop

You mean like the entire FPD? This whole thing has been building for decades. It's not ""one bad thing"", it's a whole mess of abuse that the local community has gotten heaped on them. That's why it lead to this. There's 53 people in the FPD. Either you were part of that abuse or you protected the people who committed it. There's not enough people involved here where you can say ""I didn't know it was happening"". Their actions in response to the protests just kind of layered on more shit. Even the federal government said they violated the constitution on numerous occasions. 

There's also sketchy shit like this

After Brown was shot there was nationwide protests against police brutality. This is an issue that has been simmering under the surface for a long time, and if it wasn't Brown it would have been some other innocent person. We need the police to be more accountable to the public. Now. We can't keep avoiding the issue. 

This case is symbolic of that. Is the system going to respond to the needs of the people or are they going to cover their asses like always? They're opting for the latter. Whether you think Wilson is ""innocent"" doesn't change the fact that a lot of people think he isn't, and not without reason either. Both because of how vague the case actually is (and it is indeed vague what actually happened here, other then that an unarmed guy got shot by the police), and because of the generally fucked up relationship police have with the communities they patrol. People don't trust them, and they certainly don't trust their investigators or press releases. That the FPD keeps getting caught lying about shit isn't helping heal that division. 

As fucked up as it might sound, if I see poor, marginalized, people coming toe to toe with a fundamentally abusive system then I don't really need to ask myself which side I'm on. What happened in Ferguson shouldn't be swept under the rug. Even if you think Wilson did nothing wrong, then the conduct of the police in the aftermath should have proven to people that something is fundamentally wrong with our country. People talk about the erosion of civil rights a lot. It's a particularly kind of American paranoia to believe that the government is secretly trying to rob us of our rights. Well, this is what that looks like. This is how it manifests itself. You had police, blatantly, even by the government's admission, violating the bill of rights and responding with brute force to people who (despite the media's depictions) were generally peaceful. 

I can't think of a single better reason to be out on the street raising hell. 

>or combating the rates of crime in black youth.

I read an article a few weeks ago about a couple gang members in Ferguson who saw what was happening and ended up dropping out of that life. Their reasoning was that it was stupid to sell drugs and fight with each other for survival when the real reason they're in that position to begin with is because the system has robbed them of opportunities. 

You know what gets people away from crime? Giving them something to live for. Telling them they can do better in a way that isn't some condescending lie. Young people today don't believe that typical spiel about pulling yourself up by the bootstraps. That's not our reality. We instead see hopelessness and oppression, and we aren't wrong in thinking that. The younger generation has far less opportunities then our parents did and we're losing more as time goes on. People in poor and marginalized communities are hit hardest by that. Why not sell drugs? You're black, poor, and society treats you like garbage anyway. What else are you going to do? 

If you want to deal with ""crime in black youth"" then you need to change society and you need to let them interact with it in a way that truly represents them and makes them feel meaningful, and that gives them a genuine way out of the bullshit. 

Taking part in political activism absolutely does that for a lot of people. But if you want to truly solve these problems you need genuine systemic change. Demonizing black communities like white America is so fond of doing hasn't helped. Criminalizing these people hasn't done anything either. 

If we want this country to be better, then we need things like what's been happening in Ferguson. We need people to genuinely feel that the future is in their hands and not some cop or alienated politician who doesn't give a damn about you. 

Tl;dr: We're all getting fucked over, and cynically demonizing social movements isn't helping jack shit"

Yep, so you admit that you ignored the merit of the ideas on their own and just focused on the speaker. Yep that's a pretty textbook fallacy, not sure what really to add here. I'm glad you know what biases are though. Now if you'll just absorb information and make rational decisions you'll be well on your way to being a functioning human being. 

>Firstly, I'm not claiming that because DWD did it, it's correct. I'm claiming that because DWD did it, they believe it's correct.

Nope, sorry, can't weasel out of this one. You stated ""if DWD thought that making the game more generous than it already is was going to make them more money, they would've done it."" No, you can't draw that conclusion. Even if that statement is 100% true, just because DWD is doing something doesn't mean it's correct. Again, you just straight up admit to appealing to authority and act like that's a normal thing.

Oh c'mon you can do so much better if you just applied yourself. There are a least 3 ideas in the original post. Little homework assignment for you, try to find at least 2. Also amusing that, again, you continue to focus so much on the speaker and not the words. 

>If insincerity were logical fallacies, I could just name a bunch of different forms of insincerity and not have to bother responding properly to your post at all.

Well, I think we've already established that you don't know what logical fallacies are so I wouldn't be surprised if you thought insecurity was one.

"> Your car analogy doesn't really apply.

Unfortunately this is a case of a lost cause, speaking with you, that is.

It might help you to go back to the basics of Swift written by Apple here:

 http 

And yes, this was meant to be condescending. You are discussing a well known and documented feature of Swift and saying that implicitly unwrapped optionals are the exact same as optionals. They aren't. Just do your homework to see...

>As to why you would check against nil on an outlet? You really don't have to look far to come up with some sort of example. Consider the following scenario: I have a custom view with a dataSource delegate (similar to UITableViewDataSource) and while there is a default data source at -awakeFromNib, this data source may change - or perhaps even be nil in the future. Here, it would be unwise to use an implicitly unwrapped optional because we know that this outlet may change at runtime.

Again, you did not explain your usecase for the unwrap function. Your unwrap function is useful for checking two or more optionals at the same time for not being nil. Your example talks about only _one_ data source, which you can just write one line of code without this unwrap function to unwrap the optional conditionally with the ""let"" statement.


!!! so, can you give an example of when you would actually use this to do what you intend it to do (unwrap and check more than 1 optional in one line of code?)."

It's analytic philosophy, literally the 3rd or so chapter in any introduction to meta-ethics. If you don't know what emotivism is, you likely have never been in the ""academia"", at least not in any department that has anything to do with ethics or epistemology. Now, I didn't expect you to be, neither do I hold you liable for this as no one is capable of knowing everything and if that was the norm there would be no point in conversation in the first place. My point is just, please don't play pretend with me.

Now to the substance of your post.

>I can't find anything in that text wall that explains how this position could ever hope to achieve a stable, free, fair, and functioning anarchist society.

Firstly, I'm not exactly a nihilist, but let's not get into that. Secondly, the existence or lack thereof of moral facts and the nature of moral language has nothing to do with what forms of organisation ensure a stable, functional libertarian society that conforms with any one notion of fairness. This is an empirical, practical concern that has nothing to do with ethics. The same applies to the strategy that could help us achieve that end while conforming to these values. I don't see what proscribes a non-cognitivist like me from discussing strategy. A lack of moral facts is a lack of reasonable ends, not a lack of reasonable means in association with whatever ends. What do you think your moral values add to this discussion that makes it so that I can't contribute to it? What do you think is the limitation of my perspective? Do not ascribe to me the anti-organizationalist attitude of certain egoists.

>I mean, who cares whether morality/ideology/whatever is external or internal?

What does that have to do with my post? I don't even know what this means.

>Isn't the more relevant question whether or not it's necessary?

Necessary as in ""if god didn't exist we'd have to invent him""? Some nihilist(-ish)s, the fictionalist error theorists actually agree that moral beliefs are useful and could be held because they are helpful in our lives even though they are by definition all wrong, due to the lack of moral facts (like saying ""all unicorns have a horn on their heads"", this is strictly speaking a false statement since unicorns don't exist). However, have in mind that this is an appeal to consequences. Moral facts either exist or don't. If they don't, then the fact that it would be nice if they did, isn't going to change anything. The person that supports this point of view is arguing for everyone to engage in a fantasy because it's a nice fantasy. Besides, I don't really think they are necessary.

>I understand that everyone is driven by personal emotions to some degree. That doesn't change the fact that, without an ideology/morality that's based in reason and held above personal emotions

That's not what I'm saying. I'm not privileging emotions over reason. If morality is a series of ends that are set by reason itself and would thus be chosen by all reasonable agents as such, then the question is whether such ends exist, and, thus, at a first level, whether Reason is an instrument which only has a descriptive/predictive function or whether it can also set ends-in-themselves. If the answer to this is yes, then there are moral facts, and thus we must all accept cognitivism (moral statements are truth or false apt) and moral realism (some moral statements are true). I'm not saying that even though moral facts exist, we should disregard them, and neither do the nihilists. I'm saying that such moral facts don't exist. In fact I'm saying that reason can't set ends, that it's only descriptive and that thus, descriptively speaking and as a matter of fact, all ends-in-themselves are set by our passions even when we pretend that they are reasonable. In other words, I'm saying that all moral language expresses emotional states even though we pretend it doesn't. I'm saying that when you are talking about morality, you are simply rationalising your emotional drives, pretending that what your passions motivate you to approve or dissaprove, to do or to avoid is motivated by reason, instead. Substantiate a moral framework based on Reason, and I'm dropping non-cognitivism faster than I would drop a watered mogwai. The point is that your moral framework is, from my perspective, a rationalised series of emotional urges that form a sometimes coherent system of values.

>What if, one day, a shitload of people decided that they didn't want to be altruists anymore and that giving to the poor made them unhappy?

What would you do in that case? You would argue, trying to change their mind and as I said already, I would also do that, I would try to show inconsistencies between their values -hoping that this would result in the negation of the value that I dislike- and I would appeal to their emotions, hoping to change them, because that's all that I can actually do, regardless of whether I term it an appeal to emotions or an appeal to their moral intuition. Ultimately, if all the people really adopted that perspective, whether you believe in intersubjective morality or don't won't make a difference. If people really felt happy and fulfilled in that world, you could spend all your time reiterating the categorical imperatives to the tune of the imperial march, and at the end of the day you would have just wasted your breath. As I said in my previous post, moral disagreement, after all the nitpicking of inconsistencies, ends in a bare assertion or a bare negation. You just hope that the other side will fall on your side of the fence, which is -in my opinion- only relevant with the emotional drives he has already developed which are very difficult to influence.

>In a Left-wing anarchist society, there would be social codes and institutions, formalized points of unity and group decision-making processes that people could appeal to if they felt that their rights were being threatened by the whims of others.

And that all sounds great to me. I thought you were asking me what I'd do if they no longer wanted to maintain such institutions, if they wanted to tear it all down. I'm personally very fond of organization if that's what you're asking. There is nothing in my meta-ethical views that proscribes it. And how could it, when I have already rejected normativity? I'm definitely not for chaos, neither am I an individualist anarchist, even.

>Even if nihilism isn't technically Ayn Rand

Rand: Moral facts exist, It's a moral fact that you should be a dick, Nihilism: No moral facts exist. Egoism: No Moral facts exist. It's a descriptive fact that we act in the behalf of our ego (this kind of language is what I don't like about egoism) The two have nothing to do with each other. Rand is a moral realist. Rand is the anti-paladin to Kant's Paladin. The nihilists and egoists are the rogues passing by and going meh.

>Maybe there's something I'm missing here, but I just can't figure out what would make the real-world application of nihilist anarchism any different from the ""do whatever you want and fuck everyone else whoo every man for himself""

To say that we are descriptively free to do whatever the fuck we want is not the same as saying we should do whatever the fuck we want. By noting there is no moral law, I do nothing to stop people (myself included) from organising so that our society conforms to a set of ideals, which of course entails not allowing people to do whatever the fuck they want. To assume moral law exists is almost redundant. Only the way we argue to legitimise structures changes and even that change is only a footnote to the process which remains largely the same both in terms of substance and form. As you may have noticed, moral law, unlike the laws of physics, tends to be quite lax. If I could substantiate the NAP tomorrow, beyond the shadow of a doubt, this wouldn't make Ancapistan any less violent. By this I mean, that the existence or lack thereof of moral imperatives does not make anything safer. At most it provides us with a compass that shows us what outcomes we should try to vanguard with real material force. I'm saying that the compass is broken and we should find another way to decide on those ends, no, not even that, that the compass never existed, that we always chose our ends via something other than our reason, we just pretended otherwise. But the fact we need to vanguard our chosen ends with real material force remains the same. If some moral antirealist believes that every man should be for himself, that's his thing. I'm personally with the syndicalists and the platformists. What I'm trying to say, is that you are led to a conclusion based on one meta-ethical framework, the fact I subscribe to a different framework doesn't imply I won't reach the same or similar conclusions as you. Especially considering that my framework can't entail any oughts or ought nots by definition.

If a tornado knocks down trees and they happen to land in a way that spells ""cunt"", and someone explains how it was completely random and mathematically explains how rare the odds were of it happening, it shouldn't be dismissed as ""STEM mansplaining"".

It's unreasonable to expect people to have screened and censored a ridiculous number of theoretically possible yet mathematically unlikely word combinations, but that too is ""mansplaining"", I can already see the circlejerk that will happen when you take this back to that one SRS thread you came from."

>The bigger part of the world doesn't think like that actually. 

Hey dude, I don't want to sound condescending or anything but I'm personally coming from a very salad-bowl family and have immersed myself in a lot of cultures. But once you get married to a person, considering that person the top priority of your life is a constant in every culture in the world - Japanese, Orthodox Jews, Indians, you name it.

If that's how you feel about your wife/husband, you shouldn't get married.

Missing the point. The point is not about ""choosing"". It's about being considered equal or in the top circle of one's life."
"> I don't see how being deaf is a net positive. People aren't saying you're completely disabled, they're just describing that you can't hear anything.

I don't think it's about a ""net positive"", or ""actually we're better off for being unable to hear"". As I understand it, it's more of being identified with an inherently negative label and therefore identification through absence. Deaf does mean 'unable to hear', but avoids the negativity of 'unable'. If you refer to someone in such a way, it can be interpreted as condescending or negative for example a group of marathon runners talking about ""non-athletes"" can give an air of ""not one of us"" because of the negation of ""non"". As for the identification through absence, IIRC (it's been a long time since high school) there was a fair bit of history around women's distaste to their indirect reference with ""...don't have a dick"" as their identity is around the genitals they do have, as opposed to those they don't"

"You go out of your way to help the older person rather than the 25 year older because the older person is in greater need of your help. You just made my argument for me. Chivalry, the idea that women needed to be treated better than men, is a result of the view that women are inherently in need of help. Remember, my original point was that OP was correct, and that feminism (the idea that women are equal to men) is the reason for the decline in chivalry.

Helping people who need help is great. Assuming people need and want your help because of some external characteristic that doesn't correlate to any actual disability is problematic. 

>I don't think men ever viewed women as too weak to put on their own coats, I think it was just expected that men be a little kinder to women. The fairer sex and all that. 

I said that poorly. Women weren't considered too physically weak to put on their own coats, they were considered childlike, stupid, and emotionally fragile. I ought to have said ""mentally weak"" or some such. Because they are childlike and stupid, you are supposed to treat them similar to the way you're supposed to treat a six year old, (I've seen many mothers dressing their children). Because they can't control their emotions, you're supposed to be extra special kind to them to avoid a temper tantrum. ""Fair"" in this context means beautiful (and isn't that a straight man point of view! Women are generically more beautiful than men? One would imagine one's sexual orientation would come into play there.) so I'm not sure how ""the fairer sex"" is relevant to anything. 

>Maybe some of the things, like lifting heavy objects came from the supposition that women were weaker, but generally speaking, in many cases, women do not posses the same level of upper body strength as men, it is just physiological; just as men do not possess the ability to produce breastmilk.

Generalizing people based on what group they belong to is the very definition of prejudice, with all the negative connotations that concept has. Yes, men are generally stronger than women, but that doesn't mean that I am stronger than her. Black people are also statistically more likely to go to jail. That doesn't mean that any random specific black guy is more likely to go to jail than I am. Maybe the woman works out and I don't. Maybe the black guy doesn't live in abject poverty and obeys the law, and maybe I steal shit for fun. Doesn't it then make more sense to judge on an individual level?

Also, men can produce breast milk. All you need is the right hormone. Men have, in extreme situations, breast fed their children before. Did you know baby boys often lactate because they've still got some of mommy's hormones swimming around? 

>Being treated differently because of your sex is just common sense. It will always happen. Women will get maternity leave, not men. Women should get breaks at work to breastpump if they have recently had a child and choose to do so, not men. Men will always be more sought after for laborious tasks, not women. You look at people as if there is absolutely no difference between the sexes - there are countless differences between us. 

Maternity leave is being treated differently because you're pregnant, not because of your sex. One would imagine that a pregnant man would get maternity leave, were such a thing to happen. The thing about laborious tasks I addressed previously. Its not that men and women are always the same, its that decisions should be made based on an individual's strengths and weaknesses, not generalizations about some group they belong to. 

>Why is this a problem? What negative would come from men being nicer to women?

Its a problem because its condescending, and because why should men treat women better than other men? What exactly about being a woman makes you deserving of better treatment? If its not because you're a stupid, fragile child then is it because you're better than me? I can't think of any justification for this behavior that doesn't involve some kind of value judgement about men in general or women in general. Its inherently sexist. ""Better"" is a relative term. Treating women better means the same thing as treating men worse. Maybe not ""like crap"" but worse than women. Treating one group of people generally better than another group of people is inequality, its sexism. Are you arguing that sexism is okay so long as women are benefiting? Or that its okay because its only a little sexism? Note that kindness is totally unrelated to any of those actual differences between men and women we were discussing earlier, you're just flat out saying that, for some reason, women deserve better treatment than men. 

>I don't know if you know what assault is. Not groping, not bumping or shoving, but assault? If someone got rowdy enough and you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, you couldn't do any of these, you'd either haul ass or stand your ground.

I was responding specifically to a comment about a woman punching me in the face and how I would react. That is by definition assault. You might notice the second part of my plan for dealing with an assault was to ""leave"" which I imagine is synonymous with ""haul ass."" I haven't been in a fist fight since I was 12 and that's not about to change. Its difficult for me imagine what I might do if I were forced into a situation I usually put a lot of effort into avoiding, but I guarantee that the sex of the person bothering me won't enter the equation. 

>If you were out at a bar with people you never met around you, you have zero idea how anyone would react to anything, but it is a safe bet if you touch a guy they will care infinitely less than if you touch a woman in the exact same way. (A shoulder push was the only way I could think to describe grabbing someone's shoulder and giving it a bit of a shake, sometimes following or followed by a pat on the back.)

This is so not relevant to my life that its difficult for me to comment on. Regardless, how a woman reacts to a man trying to touch her is very complicated and somewhat outside of the scope of this conversation. If a man touches a woman he doesn't know she assumes, probably rightly, that there's something sexual about it, and stuff gets weird. I personally, am rather obviously gay, and I find the women around me are not shy about touching, but I also am not often in situations where unprovoked touching of strangers occurs in the manner you're suggesting here. 

>We all have strengths and weaknesses, use them to assist someone who could use your strengths, there is nothing wrong with that.

That's completely true. Its a question of me assuming what your weaknesses are based on your gender alone. If you ask me for help opening the pickle jar, that's one thing. But if I see you with a pickle jar and I pluck it out of your hand before you can try to open it on the assumption that you couldn't possibly open it because all women are physically weak, isn't that a bit condescending? Women generally perform worse at math than men, should I assume you need me to balance your checkbook for you? At what point of me assuming your weaknesses because of your sex do you begin to get insulted? Perhaps I should assume you're competent at what you're trying to do until you ask me for help.

That's nice. I was clearly talking about feminism in general, which has pushed for benefit to women time and time again, and simply does not acknowledge female privilege over men, even when talking about men's problems.

>and their actions toward their brand of feminism are reserved predominantly to ""kill all men"" rants on Tumblr and walking into people on the street (I guess you could toss false rape accusations in here too, but I don't think these necessarily align here).

These feminists went to a talk about men's issues, and actively tried to disrupt it, up to and including pulling the fire alarm and trying to intimidate people.

Well, what if there was a documentary on MRAs?

 http 

Nope, that's not allowed either. In fact, feminist protesters got it banned at one Australian University.

There's also things like the Duluth Model, and Predominant Aggressor policies, which amount to little more than telling cops ""the man is guilty, no matter what"".

>The point being, most people who identify as feminists in the real world, not the crazy Tumblr world/gender studies major world, are gender egalitarians, and think feminism is synonymous with gender egalitarianism.

I care less about what they think than what they do. And even ""real"" feminists usually talk about Patriarchy Theory and Rape Culture and all that jazz. Just look at the crap feminists threw at Miss USA 2017 and other female celebs who say they aren't feminists. 

Sure, she's a beautiful, smart scientist and role model for girls, but she doesn't like feminism, so under the bus she goes.

For Pete's sake, some of the biggest feminist memes of the past decade are 'manspreading' and 'mansplaining'. In fact, I recently saw the latter used in the first seconds of a big-name TV show (Dynasty), which a woman used to refer to complete strangers. Confident men in suits? Must be patronizing sexists.

>But if you look predominantly in working environments, which is where people spend most of their waking hours and is a major linkage with social status, sexism seems to have a more negative effect on women both presently and especially historically. 

Feminism makes a big deal out of reproductive rights, even though women in the West often have more than men. In Spain, a woman can completely screw a man over on just an accusation of abuse. The vast majority of gendered government programs in any developed nation are to benefit women.

But hey, lets get back to the workplace. Why does feminism make such a big deal about the lack of women in executive and CEO positions, but much less about the lack of women in blue-collar jobs?

>So the movement for gender egalitarianism HAD to start with basically only things for women because they were second class citizens, (like couldn't vote until the 1920s), 

Not being able to vote doesn't automatically make you a second-class citizen, and women had power and influence before that. Catherine Norton helped push the Tender Years Doctrine (IE ""if kids are X years old, they automatically go to the mother in a divorce""), and several suffragettes were also White Feather Girls. You know, women who shamed men into fighting in WWI.

Actually, when the British suffragates were pushing for the vote, it wasn't universal for men either. You had to have X amount of property, which locked out a full third of adult men. The suffragates just wanted the vote for landed white women. The difference between women's and men's general suffrage in the UK was only a few years.

Speaking of voting, did you know many women opposed suffrage in the US and UK because they didn't want men's military obligations? And guess what; they didn't have to worry. In fact, the Selective Service system in the US is still exclusive to men. Women can't be drafted. 

Feminism has no interest in changing that, and when the possibility arose a year or two ago, I saw a lot of feminists who suddenly insisted the draft should be abolished entirely, but they refused to admit it was currently a gendered issue. And by ""refused"", I mean ""I literally asked some of them point blank and they refused to answer"". And when the attempt fell through, I didn't hear anything from the Sisterhood of the Travelling Goalposts.

>which is why that movement was originally termed feminism. 

You're doing a great job of explaining irrelevant things I didn't ask about, which shows you aren't engaging with my points instead of spouting canned arguments.

Say, do you think male rape and abuse victims were treated any better in the past than they are today? Because they weren't.

">I think if people can just mind their own business and leave other people to make their own choices, then life would be better.

Really, it is in their best interest to let other people make their own choices - if we all made the same exact choices, the criticisers would have nothing to criticise! They'd be lost in life without having anyone to judge and condescend to.

Because there's no actual reason besides getting their snobby, concern-trolling rocks off for someone to be judging my diet - unless they are a doctor, trainer, or other person whose job it is to criticise my diet. If I want criticism on my diet, the person will know, because I'll have either asked for it paid for it. 

I think it's great if people want to be healthy, and I'm happy to give suggestions if someone asks about what I do to be healthy. But I do not have enough space in my brain or in my day to be concerned about what other people are eating. I can't even remotely imagine caring, or why I would care unless it is somehow affecting me. (I wouldn't judge someone for eating ice cream, but I'd probably judge them for eating my ice cream.) I'm not the one invested in their health, they are! I'm invested in my own health. I can't be in a different body than the one I'm stuck in, so that's mostly what I'm concerned with. For some reason I trust people to run their own bodies the way they best see fit. I think I'm just coming from a really different perspective than hyper-critical diet elitists."

Then we're both in the wrong. Pointing out a logical fallacy does not also necessarily mean either party is wrong. Believing logical fallacies nullify any truth in a statement is a fallacy in and of itself.

>I feel the same. ""Support"" doesn't feel so ""support"" more than it feels ""here's an ammo kit and some explosives; do whatever.""

Which is exactly why they are changing the game up. Every class has clear purposes and wide uses, but Support doesn't have any concrete purpose. They're decent at all ranges, but are generally situational and not needed nearly as much as the other three classes.

>You like the idea of these changes because it keeps things fresh (probably not wholly accurate)

Yeah, not necessarily. I don't really mind the base game(grenade spam sucks, but I get used to things quickly so bullshit doesn't bother me easily), and I wouldn't really mind many of the solutions that people have proposed to stop grenade spam amongst other things. The reason I prefer Ammo 2.0 to all of them is that Ammo 2.0 brings along a lot of interesting changes for the game. You're right, they could put this into a new game instead of this title, but now is the perfect time to test it. They have a huge audience with a large variety of players, a game that has a lot of good mechanics that don't need touching so they can focus their game design on fixing and adjusting Ammo 2.0(yes there are other problems like map design and bugs, but I'm pretty sure other people work on that) and hopefully find a way to make it work here and in the next game if all goes well. From there, there are a lot of possibilities, since gadget balancing will be done with Ammo 2.0 in mind, and new interesting squad compositions and strategies can be done. With the Support having a much more proactive role, a great deal more strategic and tactical play can be done.

>I just don't think such a drastic change to what has been an aspect of the game since gadgets were introduced would feel ""right."" 

The game has been mostly just plain Battlefield for 4 games now. Is it too much to want something a little different, a little more interesting? To make being support much that more exciting? To make games much more tense when you're on you're spawning in with minimal ammo and you need to run to that Support?

>""feeling right"" but at the end of the day the ""feel"" that people get from the game is still important.

Here's the thing is that a great majority of players haven't even bothered to even attempt to understand Ammo 2.0, they've just come in knowing it's something different and heard about various mechanics from here and there, or from youtubers. Most people are going in already hating it when they don't even understand what it is or what it is trying to do. Ammo 2.0 has barely been out for three days now, and it's hard to do widespread testing when there aren't that many players, mostly Americans playing on the one populated EU server. How can we possibly know whether it 'feels' good or not yet? Unless we get a huge influx of CTE testers and testing on other gamemodes(mostly Operations and Frontlines), we won't truly know how well Ammo 2.0 will work and feel. It's way, way too early to call it yet.

>Just want to point out it's typically more effective to do two AT Grenades and two AT Rockets to the side, skipping the Light AT Grenade altogether in favor of reloading the rocket gun a tad bit faster 

My strat is to throw the light AT grenade first, since it can be thrown the furthest and fastest, follow up with two AT grenades, go prone and fire the AT rocket as fast as possible. It takes far too long to reload the AT rocket gun twice to fire it reasonably quickly.

>I feel the opposite as you can still have a good sense of teamwork even with a squad full of Assault players trying to tackle a tank.

And that's still possible with Ammo 2.0. What Ammo 2.0 is trying to accomplish is that a squad that is well balanced(or at least has one Support) will be far more powerful than a squad brute-forcing with Assaults.

>Ammo Bags resupplying Assaults better does not necessarily mean better teamwork

Not trying to sound condescending, but I really fail to see how Supporting a teammate with ammo is not teamwork.

>I think there should be a good balance between both instead of focusing so much on positioning. Gun skill should compensate at least somewhat for a lack of good positioning

It still does. Suppression does not completely nullify good aim. SLRs do not lose significant accuracy, they just have much worse aim spread gain when they fire under suppression. The person with better aim can still win. However, it's also bad when someone with terrible tactical sense can just run across a field and win by simply shooting everyone in the head. They want players to have to think more tactically. 

>Sniper if you start getting suppressed you're literally useless, and I fucking hate that feeling

You're not the only one. Like the devs said, the suppression system isn't perfect, and it doesn't really work well for snipers at all. I personally don't get bothered by it at all because if I can get suppressed as a Sniper, that means I was dumb and let myself get seen and should be relocating. The game punished my bad gameplay, and I don't mind it. As long as you relocate, suppression will never be a problem for you.

">I've never seen such arrogance on the internet

Then maybe you should try reading this very thread and see the kind of comments that were posted. It's been a long time since I've seen such condescending, arrogant yet simultaneously petty and jealous people in a game subreddit.

You expect perfect play from a brand new player. When you don't get it, you post nothing but disparaging shit and utterly unreasonable claims. If you cannot see why that is batshit crazy then you're beyond help. Christ get over yourselves, even if you were Sim City experts, which you aren't since all you've played is the limited open beta, your attitude is still utterly unbecoming and borderline sociopathic."
"> You're telling me, had you not known the design intent of the code, you'd be able to glance at that and intuitively know what the purpose and result of all that is?

I believe so.

The macros themselves are not inherently difficult. And in the event that macros are implemented as convenience functions they likely won't be commented at every point of their use because the result is over commenting for simple functionality.

Moving along there is also a structure definition. It's called foo, which means it's probably a contrived example and why it's missing implementation details. It doesn't really matter what or how many fields struct foo has for an arbitrary example.

There's two functions: foo_create() and foo_destroy(). Taken that there is a struct foo it's not a magnificent leap of the mind to assume one creates a new foo object and the other destroys an existing foo object. Or does C# not have constructors and destructors?

The functions take argument(s). It's pretty common to validate arguments as you receive them, which is what some of the statements immediately following the opening do { perform. After all if an argument is invalid there's no point in creating the object or destroying it, is there? Now normally I'd agree that ""magic numbers"" in code that appear from nowhere should be documented, but as this was an arbitrary and contrived example I figured it wasn't necessary. It doesn't matter why arg can't be greater than 10 - because the validation is bullshit filler to exemplify how to concisely bail out of a function early when you know you can't continue to do useful work.

As for the memory allocations, it doesn't matter if it's C, C++, or C#. You use some form of a new or malloc operator, have to check the return value for failure, and typically want to log a message (because running out of memory is a problem), and bail out early. That takes at least 4 lines of code to do neatly, but the usage of the macro condenses it down to 1, so the function body becomes shorter and easier to read and understand at a glance.

Sometimes a function has to do more than one memory allocation or object creation to succeed and if you don't get through all of them you have to unroll the prior ones, else you leak memory. That's what the flags variable is for. Because of the short function body it's easy to see that flags is non-zero at the start, set to zero at the bottom of the loop, and outside the loop if it's still non-zero everything is unrolled. In other words flags is only set to zero if everything succeeds, because every operation prior that can fail will BREAK before flags is set to zero and leave it at non-zero. Yes - I think this is plainly obvious. It's literally 22 lines of code and will fit on the smallest of terminal screens.

> I guess I just learned and have always put into practice the idea of very clear, concise commenting to explain what everything is doing and why it's being done.

There is no clearer and more concise form of commenting than code itself. For example:

 / Create a new foo and exit early if we fail, setting errno to -ENOMEM /
 foo = new foo();
 if( foo == null ) {
 errno = -ENOMEM;
 return;
 }

There is literally nothing useful about that comment, as clear and concise as it is.

Comments should be reserved for pieces of information that are important to maintain or support code at a later date. Why a particular sorting algorithm was chosen over another sorting algorithm, the source of magic numbers, the side effects of statements that may be forgotten, etc. For the code itself, if things are named intelligently, function bodies are kept short (and not overloaded with functionality), and indentation and nesting is kept to a minimum, then the code is easier to read and understand, and commenting can be reserved for things that actually need to be commented.

I don't want to be condescending but with the example I provided, if you really need comments to explain which parts are argument validating, which parts are doing useful work, and how / why the do...while( 0 ) allows for easy bail out and eliminates massive levels of nesting, then you may have just lost your ability to perform critical thinking and analysis."

______

Whether this counts as playing devil's advocate or not, there is a certain amount of (humanly relatable, if not sufficient) justification for such a double standard, not in the case of the really vindictive douchebags but more at the ""well-meaning"" end of the spectrum:

Women coming on to men isn't perceived as a physical threat against the man, and women successfully assaulting cowering men upon rejection isn't an image in most people's minds - if these popular conceptions are wrong, then it's due to selective reporting. But under that premise, people can tend towards reading such male actions as asserting their physical superiority and threat of violence over them, while considering such notions to be absurd in the other direction.

So when she reacts this way, and people see it in that context, it's perceived as a revenge both against the action itself, and its supposed violent/oppressive/condescending implication - which is a natural, common reaction.

In reverse, the people who tend to get furious at women making a rape accusation against a man that rejected her advance, aren't gonna be furious at a man who does the same - there is no built up rage against men doing that sort of thing, and much less likely trouble for the woman as a result.

If you lived in a medieval court, however, all these factors would be different and you WOULD be extremely furious.

As I said - not a sufficient justification, but more than 0 in either case. Also, tough to make estimations when his statements haven't even been heard yet? What if he actually said ""fucking bitch, I was just putting her in her place wtf"", then there wouldn't be any mystery :D"

You don’t call for the death penalty for someone who has not been proven to be guilty. “It’s better to let a guilty man walk free than to punish a hundred innocent men.” mensrights spouts that, but now they don’t when something happens to a boy? Ok…

>You really don't see the distinction? lol.
Remember, intent is important.
One is trying to send a message. The other is trying to raise money for charity.
If I want to ""send a message"" that murder is wrong, I don't go killing people i.e. doing the thing I think is wrong to show that it is indeed wrong. The Blurred lines video was trying to send the message that sexually objectifying women was wrong by sexually objectifying men. That was my criticism.

I disagree that the other was simply trying to raise money for charity. There are many routes one could go to do so, none of which could involve sexualizing cancer. Also, if the original Blurred Lines video was trying to send a feminist message and did so by sexually objectifying women, can I critique that (don't tell me it's satire)?

>If I want to raise money for a good cause? I'd definitely be down with “sucking dicks for prostrate cancer.” Why not motorboating for breast cancer?

Motorboating is in no way similar to oral sex…so, yeah. I wouldn’t be ok with it (also notice how both of those things primarily benefit men. If you want to be at least consistent, you'd need to have a breast/nipple sucking thing for women and a prostate massage thing for men). If someone wants to suck a dick/get their dick sucked, I really don’t care, but don’t do it for cancer. Just be honest. I don't see why it's a controversial opinion to think that people shouldn't exploit cancer to get their kicks.

>But don't attach breast cancer awareness to it.
> >Who wants to censor now? :)

I agree they should be able to do it. I disagree with what was done. Distinct difference (that's how I feel about a lot of things though).

>Definitely not, as long as we're not saying ""you only have to be beautiful"" to attract a good man or ""you haveto be beautiful"" to attract a good man.

I have been told not worry about certain things because “You’re pretty”. How condescending is that? Why aren't we teaching people to be healthy? Seriously, eat right, work out, destress, and laugh. You'll look better doing that than you will starving yourself to be beautiful or using steroids to be swole.

In the words of a rapper:

Look around. I'm sure there's some stuff. If not, start or campaign for your own. My own personal opinion is that we don't need separate magazines about work for men and women. Why should the tips/advice be any different?

…Those weren’t career oriented tips! Not one specifically addressed the workplace. I’m sorry, but no. The tips/advice could be different because men and women face different problems in the workplace. Yes, some problems are universal and yes, some problems overlap, but some are specific to each gender. You are correct that I could campaign for my own, which I would, but it's not a big enough concern for me ATM. 

>We've been over this. He said his words were twisted in that interview, that he was being sarcastic, and that he intended the song to be a feminist movement, with lyrics like ""that man is not your maker,"" etc.

Sounds like someone has a good PR manager ;) Also, you brought up his lyrics, but you originally asked me about the video. Perhaps he intended for the song to be feminist, but what about the video (I don't really have an issue with the lyrics, but I do with the video)? 

>Doesn't change the fact that when women wear it, it's because they think it will make them more attractive.

Why do I wear makeup when alone with my boyfriend? 

>I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one.

I don’t know how to explain that as a shy, easily overpowered, decently attractive woman it is not a flattering or safe feeling being approached by strange men or having strange men make unwanted comments about my body. It simply is not. I don't think you can really understand it until you have someone who could easily hurt you tell you ""Nice tits"" or something similar when you're walking alone at night, happen to be wearing a tanktop which shows off your figure and there's no one nearby. 

>The reason you feel more confident is because you know you appear more attractive -- there's nothing inherent about putting on a mask that makes someone more confident.

Not really. The only people I’m trying to impress are myself and my boyfriend and we have different ideas of what is most attractive for me. So sometimes I wear mascara because I like it, even if I know he prefers me not to. Sometimes (most times) I wear fitted clothes because I like it, even though I know he prefers me in something looser like my sweats or a dress. Sometimes I wear my hair up even though he likes it down, etc. It’s not simply because I think it makes me look more attractive, because if it was, I’d dress for him. I do sometimes, but the majority of how I dress is done because I like it and other people can either like it or not, doesn’t matter.

Also, as someone with fair skin and blonde hair, putting on makeup doesn't generally make me more attractive. We don't need to talk about make-up here, but I can't pull off as much makeup as most other women. Some women do in fact look better with less makeup and even no makeup.

I’m far more intrinsically motivated than most people. 

 >I mean, is that really more of a lie than the woman who wears high heels, a push up bra, and massive globs of makeup? To me, they're the same thing. One is lying about how you look, the other about how much you're worth. If intent is really important as you say, then it's more important that we know why the guy says he makes 400k. Is it because he's trying to deceive her into sleeping with him? Or could it be because he wants to feel emotionally connected to someone but feels like he can't get in the door with his real paycheck? Or because he wants to feel validated, like he's worth something?

I thought I made my example clear that he was saying it just to deceive her into sleeping with her. Intent is very important, but so is honesty and you still need to consider the repercussions of trying to attain whatever is you're looking for.

>Ultimately, you're still relying on guesswork, on feelings and the limited evidence you have. There's no ""hard proof"" of someone's intent unless you get inside his/her head at the moment of the action.

Such is life.

Last edit: I was just walking home and stuff happened and I thought about this and I want to touch on the point I made when I said:

""I don’t know how to explain that as a shy, easily overpowered, decently attractive woman it is not a flattering or safe feeling being approached by strange men or having strange men make unwanted comments about my body. It simply is not. I don't think you can really understand it until you have someone who could easily hurt you tell you ""Nice tits"" or something similar when you're walking alone at night, happen to be wearing a tanktop which shows off your figure and there's no one nearby.""

I'm going to go off on a tangent here. The clothing I wear is indicative of little more than a) the weather b) my comfort level. It's not an invitation for men to make comments, touch me, etc. You seem to have had bad experiences when hitting on women with them being rude to you. I seem to have had bad experiences with men hitting on me with being sexually aggressive. Part of the reason I really dislike the idea of being approached as apposed to doing the approaching is probably a direct result of this. Sure, some guys are perfectly kind and respectful and it's all good. Others, however, are not. Now, I'll bet you're going to say, ""Well, that's to be expected. You just need to learn how to deal with it since it's always going to happen."" The thing is though, is that there can be a fine line between hitting on someone and catcalling/being way more sexually aggressive than common decency dictates and this line is frequently crossed and it seems like many guys just don't get that. 

I get catcalled/groped more than I get hit on. I'd say on average I get catcalled at least twice a week and groped probably once every two weeks. If I could do away with the aggressive stuff, maybe the being hit on part would be better, but it's not. I have to simultaneously deal with both. Imagine if you were told to expect that once every few days a man who could easily overpower you will yell at you while you are walking that he wanted to kill you. Do you think it's reasonable to think that that's an issue that should just be learnt to be dealt with by the victim? Imagine if every two weeks someone who could easily overpower you held a knife to your back or rubbed a blade against your thigh and looked you dead in the eye. Do you think it's reasonable that this is acceptable and no one is doing anything to help since 'people are always going to do it'? 

It's easy to assume you'd like one way (being approached) vs. another (doing the approaching) when you think of just the positives. But when ignore the major ramifications of what being approached can mean, you're going to be biased.

Rereading this edit, it's not coming out the way I want it to, so you can ignore this if you like. It's not really clear what I mean/what my intent is.

Some say I'm out of sight, how ironic and that we're all so blind.

> What problems did you have with LibreOffice?

My last interaction with LibreOffice peeps was more than a year ago, when I found out that LibreOffice's .ppsx support is subtly broken because unlike MS Office, LibreOffice can't convert a .ppsx file to something else. I also, with a little help from my reddit friends, found out roughly what the problem was, and got one or two workarounds (some thanks to fellow redditors), studying which would allow a developer to fix these issues and write a proper import/export filter. 
I would summarise my problems during that interaction as ""Michael Meeks"". 
Of course he's just one of the knights who say NIH and pass the buck back; he's not so special with that attitude – though in exchange for your free helpful information, he will not read your input and proceed to give you a condescending sanctimonious lecture on how special and important he is, and top it off by calling you angry. Suffice it to say that LibreOffice's .ppsx compatibility deficiencies are still unresolved (as of v4.0.2), and if you don't have the knowledge about workarounds that I tried in vain to volunteer to the project, then you're pretty much shafted as a LibreOffice user."

If we even compare a struggle that we face they claim that we have no struggles as a gender and that they just do not exist and are just whining. 

The fact that you ignored the spirit of my post, which was that men face fear of these accusations everyday, even when we did nothing wrong, and then go on to spout off your offense to the part about feminism, convinces me that you hold this belief and probably think that this guy deserves the scrutiny just because......male........dangerous.......we must protect the children.......OMG!!!!!!

"> ~~Its like~~ she is not even listening to this kid. 

That kid had a better head in this situation than a trained operator.

Some emergency operators are incredible, some not so much...

I got one of the latter when I had to call in a bad car accident and fuck she was a total bitch.

Among other things; at one point, a lady who had been trapped in the car, was finally freed by people helping at the scene.

They started to try to get her out of the car, but I thought that maybe they should leave her there (possibility of head/neck/spine injuries - who knows?)

So I told the people to wait a moment and then asked the operator ""should we be trying to get her out of the car or should we leave her where she is?""

She says ""I don't know. I can't see"" in a completely condescending manner.

I couldn't fucking believe it. I didn't argue back, but was thinking ""well, could you maybe run me through some things to check for and maybe some questions to ask the lady?""

>Because most PTSD does not develop from war.

I am still not sure what you are on about here. Unless there is a form of PTSD that did not originate as shellshock that I am unaware of. based on that, everything else here is moot. I mean the fact is people get PTSD on the battlefield, and after traumatic events that happen in their own backyards. How many people are involved in wars around the world at any given moment. Not just soldiers, but civilians that are caught int the crossfire?? Multiply that by decades and the number of PTSD are gonna be pretty darn high.

As for people trivializing triggers, that does happen sometimes and usually because others have made it sound so ridiculous. We see things like ""my father won't let me cut my hair. I am so triggered"". Or The grocery store was out of my favorite toilet paper. I am so triggered"" The second one is a bit of hyperbole on my part, but it illustrates the co-opting of the term by dopey SJWs in which some find more offensive than what we do, especially to people like soldiers or EMS personnel for example.

Most of which, when they actually engage some of us in a manner such as this see we are not as bad as we are made out to be. Even the infamous Idesoflight has admitted we are not so bad. She even did an AMA here that went pretty well.

As far as your abuse in other comments. That unfortunately is gonna happen for several reasons. One is people see a pink tag they downvote on instinct. the other is a lot of SRSers that come here do so in a condescending, antagonistic sorta attitude. People do not like that shit LOL... You sorta had that vibe in the beginning as well. After this though, maybe your perception has changed a little bit and the things you disagree with will be more like our exchange we have going on here now. Probably won't stop all the downvotes, but at least you guys can come here to chat with us. We do not have the luxury of going to SRS subs to talk. "
">People keep saying you can't expect it to be Trek after 6 episodes except every other show was arguably trek after even less.

Like you said, arguably. I'd argue against it personally and I've been a fan for 30 years and started with TOS. I find that trying to undermine other people's opinions on Star Trek because they aren't ""real"" fans or haven't been watching long enough to be a condescending tactic.

You seem fixated on space being vast and it taking a long time to go from point A to point B. The point of exploring the vastness of space isn't the wait between getting from A to B, it's meeting new aliens or seeing something you haven't seen. Seems to me that you could do more exploring with great sensors and an instantaneous drive.

>Take a look at how the Borg were introduced in TNG; a massive jump across the galaxy caused by Q

Going off your point about space being vast, we can say that the Enterprise did no exploring in that episode. Even though they met a new race and learned some lessons, they didn't explore because they didn't have to wait to traverse the space between them and the Borg.

The wait time from point A to point B is not the core of exploring. Otherwise we'd have episodes with starships travelling space for 45 minutes and we can pat ourselves on the back for all the exploring we're doing."
">Just because you can think up a scenario where lump sum would have a better return, doesn’t make it mathematically superior.

Just because you can think up a scenario where DCA would have a better return, doesn't make it superior either.

The fact is that there's decades over decades of research on this, and every quant worth their salt will tell you that DCA is a worse strategy than simple lump sum investing. 

Sorry to sound condescending, but really, it's just in these circlejerks of clueless armchair economists and ""traders"" that this gets parroted as a good strategy. Academics and research has long, long, long proven that DCA is a bad idea. 

>I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not, but investing $10,000 over the course of a year vs $10,000 when you first hear about Bitcoin (and are probably having serious FOMO) is definitively a lower risk strategy.

Again, like the other guy, I'd like you to think about the following scenario, I really hope that will eventually make the fallacy clear to you. I understand it's not easy to understand, because DCA seems to do something, but if you understand and value logic, it should make click at some point. 

Going by your example of investing $10k over a year into bitcoin, say you have done that, you've eased into your position, and allegedly reduced your risk doing so. Doesn't matter what the price did in the meantime, now, after a year, you're fully invested. Let's say you own 5 btc now. You keep them for a few months, watching their value go up and down. For whatever reason, you have them sitting on an exchange, and the exchange accidentally sells them (an intern spilled coffee on the wrong keyboard). 

Now the important part: the exchange offers you to either just give you the 5 btc back (so nothing changed for you), or to give you the proceeds of the sale ( = exactly what your 5btc are worth now, say, $15k).

If DCA made any sense, you should take the fiat, because you are presented with a lump sum, and allegedly, you should DCA to reduce your risk when exposing this sum to the volatile bitcoin market.

But if you really think about it, it doesn't matter if the exchange accidentally sells your btc, you could sell them at any time yourself! So if that's true, why would you even hold the 5btc ever? You should sell them and dollar cost average in. At every. point. in. time. That's the heart of the DCA fallacy. When you understand why that kind of thinking is nonsense, you understand why DCA is nonsense, and why ""reducing risk"" and ""not being exposed to the market"" are not the same thing."

Regardless, you can't judge that a 16 year old girl will do nothing but cause harm and misery with her life. The conceit that you think you could, or that you fantasize about being able to do it is pathological.

>i was referring to a chance they may leave the westboro baptists for another life.

There is a reason people typically use quotes to put their arguments in context. For future reference, copy the salient point and then paste it after a "">"" symbol.

No, you mean that you would state this with no supporting evidence. That is what you've done.

>I could live a vastly better life by doing this and live happily with myself, why wouldn't I?

Most intelligent creatures place value on the well being of others. If you don't, one explanation is that your brain is not fully developed (i.e. you are a freshman in high school). A second possibility is that your brain is damaged and you will never reach a fully human state where you can appreciate the value in other lives.

No, I have a bar. You advocate for actions with no relevant knowledge or forethought. The fact that you would (say you) feel comfortable killing someone without knowing even basic facts about their history is evidence of that. Likewise your feigned belief that it is okay to kill random innocent people.

>Nice ad hominem, real mature buddy

""Ad hominem"" isn't a fancy way to say ""insult"" you dip shit. It is a term that describes a logical fallacy. What it means is that an argument is of the form ""Because you are bad thing X, your argument is wrong"". My argument does not have that form and hence, is not accurately characterized by the phrase ""Ad hominem"". My comments contain descriptions of what I think of you - e.g. that you aren't smart, that you are a coward, that you feel powerless and so on. The reasoning of my arguments, however, isn't based upon your numerous and obvious flaws. The reasoning stands independent of your embarrassing characteristics.

>Also, I'm not arguing from a point of morality, purely self interest

If you mean this phrase to be ""I am pretending to be a psychopath cause I think it will make sound cooler on Reddit"" then sure, I agree. You aren't a psychopath though, as evidenced by your compunctions against killing children or women (""Oh, but it would make me feel uncomfortable... It really is all about me"" Right, that feeling of discomfort is called a conscience...).

Wait, first you say it is moral to kill someone to save the human race, then you say moral absolutes are retarded. What could you possibly have meant by this juxtaposition? The first sentence is an absolute statement about morality (""X is moral"") and the next statement is that moral absolutes are retarded? Are... you saying that your own argument is retarded?

>How is it that you have decided i would NOT kill Hitler?

Because there are genocidal dictators running free today and you take no effort to kill them. Your behavior now is the best predictor of your behavior in the future. The only reasonable expectation that we should have about your behavior in hypothetical situations is that it would be embarrassing.

>great quote, i like it. I was talking about moral absolutes being the white and black. Nothing is intrinsically right or wrong, its all relative to the situation

You have failed to understand the quote. This is not surprising though. The point is that the fact that some things aren't black and white doesn't mean you can't make judgements about the differences in two shades. One action is still worse, objectively, than another. Moral judgements can still be credibly made and be objectively true even if they are on a gradient.

>What else could good and bad mean? Well I don't know man. Anything

No. They can't mean ""anything"". You can't have a conversation about two words if you think those words mean anything. If you have a definition then you can share it and we can talk about why you are wrong. If you don't have a definition, don't bother replying.

This is an easy question. Did blowing up the twin towers improve the well being of conscious creatures? No. Did it harm it? Yes. Was the act ""moral""? No. Not ""it is all relative man, who can say"" but simply ""No"". That was an immoral action. Next question.

>There is no one conception of good and bad.

I have given it above.

>Why do I have to accept your form of morality?

It describes what people intuitively mean when they say things like ""good"" or ""bad"" and you have no alternate definition.

>Why would i care for the well being of other creatures?

I never said you did care for their well being. I said that is what being moral is. Obviously I don't think everyone is moral. If you don't care for the well being of other creatures then you are immoral. See how easy this is?

">What are you even talking about? I have no idea of military tactics? Ive served 8 years in the british army i have done junior and senior brecon and am currently a section commander, i used militrlary tactics in 3 operational deployments. 

Missed the point entirely, wouldn't expect anything else from you, based on your posts.

You say you were a conscript from which country? Did you experience war?or was it just training exercises? Which make you the master of infantry tactics.

Irrelevant to the discussion but apparently you can't understand that. We are not here to discuss war, we are here to discuss an attack with firearms against a guard in ceremy uniform, posted somewhere around a key building for all the public to see. Should you be able to read and analyse texts you'd see that but your ability to do so is currently greatly inhibited by your emotional response. Read my comment on what I did in the military.

>I was never talking about in the event of a full scale armed attack on a royal property.i was talking about a member of the public assaulting a guardsman on sentry, in which case everything i have said is correct it is in part 1 orders.

Oh, so now you change the parameters? The topic was always about an armed attack against a guard which requires firing back at the aggressor. Sad that you can't read, did you sucl at your education?

>And just for your information, in the event of being shot at while on sentry, as i stated, you have no ammunition,all you could do is find cover, which if at the palace there is none, and wait for a reaction force from the guardroom to be deployed, which again i previously stated. And another one for you, even if someone is armed you need to fire 3 warning shots before you can fire on them unless you are 100% sure if you do not fire on them they will kill a royal.

And you are saying that rather than ditch the headgear you'd keep it on? Rather than increase your chances of survival by removing a hindering headgear you'd keep it on?

>You have not called me out on any bullshit, everything i have said is true you are an outsider with no experience other than what you have read on the internet who has no clue, but keep playing call of duty and ""learning your military tactics"" im sure they will help you in real life should you ever have to experience it

And again, an emotional response that overlooks everything I have written. True, my condescending style induces anger and that is its point. Were you a proper soldier you'd be able to overlook any personal attacks and focus on the facts.

Also, I can say the same about you. You have no credentials on the internet.

I have also clearly stated that I have no intention of pleasing you. You are cunt, an idiot and stupid as a boot. You can correct this by disregarding the shit I pour at you and focus on the metal that I also coat you with. Were you a professional soldier you'd be able to do that.

If you still can't read nor understand I will lay it out for you clearly:

If a guard is fired at or if he is otherwise in a life and death situation that requires moving fast and seeing clearly, he will optimise his chances of survival. Most often this includes ditching the fancy headgear of which removal is not that hard.

This is just a copy and paste from a wiki article I have already read...

> So Littlefinger is not in Winterfell 

Neither was Joffrey at the time.

> Has no idea about Bran, or his condition 

Sure he does. They sent word to King's Landing that Robert would be delayed.

> Has no motive to hurt Bran, as his plan to sow discord is already in effect

Not really. This is early in the beginning of the book...

> Lies to Catelyn about the ownership of the dagger, has no access to the dagger, as it now belongs to Robert (during said events), 

He doesn't need access to it...

> Puts Catelyn in mortal danger by not giving the assassin special instructions regarding her safety (you know, since he knows Bran was pushed, he knows Bran saw Jaime and Cersei, he knows they have motive to push him... cause of the spies) 

Well, the catspaw says that she wasn't supposed to be there.

> How would Littlefinger communicate with a petty catspaw? Raven? (Impossible: How could a raven be trained to fly to a catspaw pussyfooting around and living in the stables, and moreover how could the catspaw read the message?)

Raven. Nobody is saying the catspaw is his spy. Somebody working with Littlefinger could have hired him.

> Just for reference, here's that evidence, so we can put this to rest finally:

But it is still just inconclusive evidence. There are plenty of unreliable POVs and characters in the books. That is a large part of how they work.

The other problem I have is that Joffrey doesn't seem to have told Robert about it and if he doesn't tell Robert then Jaime's motive for Joffrey falls apart. So that and the fact that the catspaw wouldn't need to be given a dagger makes me skeptical.

Sanders didn't have any god damn policies, you condescending dipshit. All he had were a bunch of vague ideas, with absolutely no idea how to implement them. Days before the NY primary (at which point the primaries had already been going on for months), when an interviewer FINALLY pressed him on how he actually planned to accomplish his goals for financial reform, he quickly revealed that he hadn't even thought about it and didn't have a clue. That was his pet issue, and he was utterly CLUELESS about it underneath all the bombast. He never, EVER gave the American public one fucking ounce of hard policy details. He's a useless blowhard who just likes to yell and point fingers, without ever having to do the hard work of figuring out how the hell all the nice things he promises could ever possibly come to fruition. He's been in Congress for a quarter of century, and do you know how many tangible achievements he's gotten under his belt during all that time? ZERO.

But surely, our country would be MUCH better off in the hands some do-nothing, know-nothing sack of empty platitudes like Sanders, rather than an experienced policy wonk like Clinton, with real plans and a real track record of accomplishments behind her. It must be so, because a smug asshole foreigner has up and decided that they know our own candidates better than we do.

I will point out that I am absolutely not opposed to higher education anyone if that's what they choose to do. However, I personally believe that there exists a direct relationship between a woman's desire to enter the workforce with respect to her level of education, and because of this belief, which is solely subjective, I would prefer being with a woman who does not hold a Phd. Additionally, I think a woman's attitude changes when she attains such academic heights. I sense that she walks around with an air of superiority as she now thinks of herself as more ""empowered"" by her accomplishment(s). Moreover, from personal experience, I can hear it in the tone of their voices that they think them self more intelligent than others because of their piece of paper framed in their office. I can see their arrogance looking into their eyes. The same can be said about men, but I'm not planning on marrying a man. And while I do respect peoples accomplishment pertaining to things academic, I do not respect arrogance, regardless of gender. I want to show the woman I marry the utmost respect, for she is the mother of my kids; therefore, I would prefer an average educated woman.

> but without premarital sex and cohabitation, that's practically impossible to find out

I agree to a certain extent (the cohabitation part), but disagree with the remainder. Here's why I disagree (I want to emphasize that I'm not saying that you are wrong):

From my experience, I know I can tell a tremendous amount regarding the sexual compatibility between me and a woman without going all the way with her; and likewise, a woman, I believe, even more so than a man, can clearly sense the amount of sexual compatibility that exists without going all the way. She can sense this by how a man touches her, how he kisses her, how he looks at her, how aggressive he is, how dominant he is, and how passionate he is and would be if she went all the way with him. In my past, I didn't need to insert in order to be able to tell the amount of sexual compatibility that existed between us. Indeed, from what my ex, who was a virgin,(and remained so because I would not take her unless we were married which I'm sure she's happy about that now being that we are no longer together) and I did do physically together, was more than telling that we would be sexually compatible if we were to get married. I knew this more than she did, given my previous experience which was obviously more than hers being that she was a virgin and I wasn't.

You reap nothing from its success (aside from maybe a feeling of pride and accomplishment from your freely provided bug reports/feature requests). The developer gains all the reward.

Mods on reddit have very few tools, really, with which to manage these things. Locking a thread is unilaterally ending a conversation. Deleting posts or banning posters totally silences them. The bot overlord seems to be as much of a middle ground as is possible. There are no perfect options.

Combine that with the passion a lot of people have for their favorite franchises and the negative image of third wave feminism as a whole and you have a recipe for trouble.

Yes, this! After my SO spent more than a month in the hospital, I lost all respect for nursing in general. There were some adequate nurses and some wonderful ones, but they were so overshadowed by the aggressively unpleasant ones.

Side note--the ICU nurses were wonderful. Later, when we brought our experiences up with hospital administrators, they would say (condescendingly) 'yeah, the one-on-one nursing on that floor is very convenient.' Uh no, that's not the point: the fact that the nurses were knowledgeable and treated my (incoherent and aggressive to the point of needing restraints) SO with RESPECT. They put up with lots of shit and were total professionals about it. Meanwhile--general floor nurses said that he complained too much when he needed a bandage for his growing bedsore. Exact quote"" You've asked me three times already & I told you I'm coming each time"" - yes, he asked 3 times over 3 hours. And when she finally sent another nurse in, that nurse came with a small band-aid and insisted that he had asked for a band-aid.

Oh it's the truth.

"> but for those who have experienced the friend zone

I don't mean to sound condescending, but if we're assuming the existence of a friendzone and you've spent time there, as a gay man, I very much would have to ask you for rent. =p

Now, I can't judge your interaction with the girl that you mentioned, obviously, because I'm not privy to the whole thing, but there's a few things that strike me from what you said.

> In my experience I was led on and used.

> Long story short she just wanted to fuck my best friend

I don't think the latter implies the former, but that predicates on your meaning of and motivation for the word ""just"". Can you clarify? Do you think (or more concretely, have evidence for the idea) that she was using you to sleep with your friend? If so, I don't think the problem you should have with her is one regarding friendzoning. That's downright manipulative. If, however, she just incidentally slept with your best friend, more power to her. She can do what she wants and sleeping with your friend doesn't preclude a friendship with you. If that's the case, I can't see your not speaking to her again as being justified. Now, that's not to say that, if she was aware of how you felt, being mindful of your feelings would have been going astray, but she's not obliged to do so.

> I was very bitter and I believe it was within my rights to be bitter.

I wholeheartedly agree. But if you're being bitter at her and she didn't nothing wrong, I'm afraid I can't agree with that specific point. Be bitter at the unconscious world and get your anger out there, but I just feel it's not justified blaming her for not liking you and liking someone else.

> I do expect someone to tell me they're not interested when I approach them so I can continue on with my life and pursue other relationships.

I think this is very different in the case where you try to build and friendship and in the case where you openly pursue the person romantically. My initial thought reading that is that you were being dishonest in your friendship. If it would not exist without the hope of developing into something else, then I don't think it's right to pretend it's a friendship. If you're pursuing someone romantically and only romantically, sure, move on, find someone else. But if you befriend someone under the pretense of friendship and drop them when you realise it will only be just that, is that not a bit disingenuous?

> it is very real and can be very painful.

I don't disagree with this. In fact, I can empathise with it. But the way it's mythologised on Reddit is nothing short of portraying someone as an evil puppeteer for simply not reciprocating romantic attraction. That's the part I take issue with. And, to a lesser extent, the hyperbole, as if the friendzone is the worst thing that could happen to someone. That is a personal bone of contention to me, of course, and doesn't come from such a rational place."

You probably quit, and I imagine the number of players that quit because they feel like their time is being wasted after a certain leveling point is quite large.

"> It's a good assumption since without the gender context he has absolutely no reason to defend the gatekeeper in a sub dedicated to mocking gatekeeping.

I don't think it is that good of an assumption. He has plenty of other possible reasons, like being new to this community because he came from /r/all, having been through this situation with a friend, or having been himself overly defensive about some question as well in the past. Heck, he doesn't even need any reason. I see plenty of blatant and non sarcastic gatekeeping examples every day on this sub, and if some of them are sexist, some have no better reason to exist than this one and don't even have the gender context to justify them.

This assumption can be actually pretty dangerous, because by assuming that every criticism made towards a woman (even poorly made ones) is motivated by sexist reasons, you suggest that women can't be criticized because any single argument towards them, good or bad, becomes automatically invalidated. It's benevolent sexism, and it fuels sexist opinions. Just like mansplaining is used to invalidate any dissent towards women.

> His ""i mean for both genders"" is a weak backpedal for his already stupid opinion

Again, not arguing the stupidity of the opinion. But I fail to see how applying an opinion to both sex is sexist. It's exactly the opposite of sexism, it's basically saying ""I don't care who it is about, I'm talking about the situation, not the people""."

">I don't know how you go through the process of deciding what is an acceptable level of offending people and what isn't.

This is just the sort of thing you have to get a feel for by living life and figuring out how to get along with others, I guess. Importantly, the standards of acceptability will vary wildly from community to community, which is something that I think is lost in this debate when people want to just broadly condemn certain sorts of speech or expressions.

Suffice to say, part of what I find frustrating about these debates is that it's not really about protecting the offended, because as I said no one would care if I get offended over being labeled a misogynist, etc. The obvious reason I'd object to the term is that it's a label that's meant to end the debate - once it's established that you're an unrepetant sexist/misogynist, then any sort of scorn or abuse can be justified. I most certain can say things that ""make me seem like a misogynist"" while caring about being called a misogynist, for the same reasons that people often care when they do stuff that causes them to be mislabeled negatively (eg. are women allowed to care when they wear a tank top to FNM and get labeled as a slut? ""But she was wearing the uniform!"", etc.)

>There are people who would rather put people down just so that they can seem superior to them. They want to show that they have a better understanding of how things should work.

The problem with this is that posts on this site complaining about this group being a circlejerk are most often way, way more angry than the recent converts in this group.

I often see confused people here, people making pleas for help, people who are isolated and trying to connect with other atheists, people who politely seek answers, and yes, also, people who are angry at religion. There's a wide range of discussion and emotion here, which I think is good.

"> If you're a man over 50 years old when you think of women you think of wives, girlfriends, mothers, sisters, and daughters. Lovers, helpmates, people in need of help/protection, or pains in the ass. Or some combination of the above. So that is what they write women as.

That's a little sad. Maybe this is presumptuous but if you're a writer I think your job is to write characters as autonomous people, not in how they relate to you. At least that's what they told me in every creative writing class I've ever taken. Your assertion that men are only capable of writing women as stereotypes doesn't speak well to their writing ability. It's also sad that men apparently can't see women as friends or authority figures.

I'm no great writer, but I think if I were to write a screenplay I wouldn't need to write every male character as a masculine stereotype. thats just not interesting. How hard is it to write people as... People?

>SJWs accuse writers, including Rice, of all kinds of things when they write novels with a protaganist or antagonist of a different race or gender from their own complaining that the writer is ""misappropriating (someone's) voice"" or whatever PC crap term they use to describe it. Rice complains of ""censorship"" (of course it's not really censorship) and threats. But this is what you think male writers should be doing more of. But it is probably at least one reason why male writers in their 20s and 30s don't want to.

People are constantly calling me an SJW on this site when I have the audacity to call out gender bias. I find it a condescending and meaningless term meant to invalidate my opinion as melodramatic hysteria, rather than trying to relate issues that affect me in my daily life. I digress.

Perhaps there are some critics of Anne Rice making unfair assumptions of her writing. I don't read her books so I wouldn't know what the claims are. For all I know, her depictions of people of color are totally racist and just bad writing. Again, I don't read her books, so I can't comment on her complaints about her critics, because she's just as capable of misrepresenting their opinions as they are of unfairly criticizing her writing.

I will say that I virtually never hear about this kind of thing anywhere other than reddit. I truly don't hear about the over the top ideas ""SJW""s have, and I run with a lot of feminists, until someone who hates SJWs is trying to discredit them.

That said, her critics would be wrong to criticize her only in the basis of writing characters that are different from her. I will say, however, that the vast, vast majority of gender and racial equality activists have no such complaint. Most of them greatly encourage all writers to depict their groups and give better representation. I've literally never heard a black person complain about white people writing black characters, unless the depiction was racist, stereotypical, and one dimensional.

I think Anne Rice is trying to deflect accusations of racism by misrepresenting her critics. I can't be sure, but from an outside perspective, I'm just going to take her account with a grain of salt. Based on what I've seen, it is not at all a trend within the community you're attempting to reference.

I've seen nothing but praise for writers like Paul Feig and JK Rowling for their gender characterization. As far as white writers writing fleshed out black characters... I truly can't think of one off the top of my head.

As far as male writers not wanting to write women for fear of criticism, they're going to get a ton more criticism for not representing women, from critics of actual esteem. It's just not a good mark of a writer to write a story with so few women in it when over half the world is female. It's just denial of reality."
"> If it were meant to be gender invariant it wouldn’t invoke a specific gender in the word.

Do you think men can't be feminists, or think feminism doesn't mean ""social movements to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social equality of sexes""? 

The existence of a gender in a word doesn't automatically exclude the entire other gender. Instead, it speaks to something about the origin of the word--women were pushing for women to get equal rights before everyone got on board and started thinking about equal rights broadly. That's why the movement was called feminism instead of egalitarianism. Mansplaining was coined to describe a behavior dynamic primarily carried out by men towards women, but the definition is (I always thought), exactly as the ManWhoWasNotShort said above: technically gender invariant, but ""often"" traveling in one direction. The context of the term's origin or how it is often applied doesn't mean it's sexist, anymore than feminism is sexist for having a gendered name despite fighting for equal rights. "
"> you are mistaking a person's general rational self-interest with Evil, or you just have an unconscious bias against lawyers.

I would never mistake someone's rational self interest with any idea of Evil. I would even go so far as to say that I condone greed at times. Like I mentioned before, I've interacted with ruthlessly driven individuals who are obsessed with wealth, which I find odious at times. But what distinguishes them from the lawyers/prospective lawyers I met is that I rarely got the sinister vibe from them, that I had to be wary about them should I ever be deeply involved with them in any way. It doesn't help that I found a lot of them to be disgustingly obsequious to superiors, but rude and condescending to those beneath them.

> if you're an atheist and have had this said to you many, many times with clear body language that it's been meant in an insulting way

You're presuming body language, too. We're just talking about ""I'll pray for you"", when the pray-er is aware that the pray-ee is an atheist.

> How would you feel if when you said, ""I'll pray for you,"" atheists responded, ""And I'll use reason for you.""

That'd be cute. I could see if it was done in a condescending body language, etc. that it could be offensive, but of course if someone is trying to offend you, then that's fait accompli. Just the words, if not snarked, are not offensive. If the atheist truly was intending that following the exchange, they would ""reason"" on behalf of another person (whatever that means), then that sounds good to me.

> Between a believer and non-believer, it's not a shared cultural expression, and its often not offered out of love, but as a snide ""I'm better than you evil heathen"" type of comment.

Sure, culturally different perspectives matter. But again, you assume that the believer is snide.

> Ultimately, being polite usually means doing to someone as they wish, rather than as you wish... which in this case should be to offer the non-believer a good day (which doesn't stop you praying for them in private, but does ensure you don't insult them by presuming).

Fair enough, I'll cede that point of polity. But for two open-minded individuals, if someone offers you something that you know is a common expression of care from their culture, and it's not common / polite in yours, is the polite response to accept it graciously and think ""how quaint, we don't do that where I'm from"", or is it to throw your hands up in disgust and offense? 

> We have real life experience where its not meant in good ways (likely far more often than you imagine).

Again, fair enough. From one human to another, and in the sincerest expression of reason, logic, and sociologically founded principles, I wish you the opportunity to overcome prejudice and stereotype by keeping your mind open to the hope that the person you meet today is not the embodiment of the experiences of your past, even within a cultural group. This has been a core tenet of Christianity (do unto others as you would have them do unto you), and in that spirit, I will endeavor to be careful with how I express my I'll-pray-for-yous going forward.

Gender segregation, even if it's for a ""good"" reason, is extremely condescending when put into practice. I do not want to see my female comrades regulated to the back of the room either today or in a future society.

Also, there are plenty of religious institutions where men and women are integrated which do not have an issue of ""less focus"". That entire premise (that women are inherently ""distracting"" and must be controlled) hurts progress towards female emancipation.

"> I'm simply interested in how you determined that Catholicism was true.

I didn't. I don't know what is true. I believe things are true. I believe reason is connected to reality. I believe that the scientific method is a valid approach to pursuing the answers to some topics. 

But largely, I have accepted all my beliefs through socialization. And when I approach people of different religions, I don't approach them with the condescending approach that I'm right and they're wrong. I simply talk to them. We compare beliefs and respect each other's beliefs. When people have changed their beliefs, it's never been 180's. Everyone changes bit by bit. I talk about Catholicism the way I talk about home birth and healthy eating. I feel that it offers something that I want to share and offer to others. 

 It's not like what I believe or why I believe has remain static. When I was in high school. I wanted compelling evidence. The stories of the incorrupt bodies of various saints, Eucharistic miracles and apparations of the Blessed Virgin and stories other teens came back with after attending a Steubenville Retreat (being exposed to the charismatic movement within Catholicism) really had a profound influence on me. Now, though? I don't know what to make of that stuff. It's weird, but it's not essential to my faith.

At another point it was about private spiritual experiences I had when I was in prayer. I take those experiences with a grain of salt. A lot of times when I share my experiences with others, they're more impressed with it than I am. 

I think ""evidence"" is just data. It can be interpretted to mean a lot of different things, much like how statistics can be easily manipulated. There are a lot of logical ways to interpret evidence, but there's no one way to know if you've interpretted it correctly. You just have to go with what seems true to you. What speaks to your heart? Because your head only will take you so far. 

What you believe is what you believe. I could argue with you about the historicity of whether Jesus was real. I could argue with you about a lot of things. I haven't come across a new refutation in awhile. And the thing is, I find both explanations valid. I have had to decide on my own which I personally find more convincing.

">I have met many who would beg to differ.

I would wager most feminists would beg to differ - the thing is, you can't necessarily judge a movement based on the opinions of its supporters. Since feminism has branched out into so many varying subgroups, it's very easy to make the argument that you can't generalize the movement - but as with any movement, there are certain cohesive underlying themes throughout. We can judge it by the words and actions of its largest advocacy organizations - the legislation they've pushed for / against, the causes they've petitioned and protested for / against.

I've heard the argument that even the largest feminist advocacy groups in the country somehow don't represent feminism; but the reality is they do. Just like how the Democrat party represents Democrats - it isn't representative of everything every Democrat believes, but it does represent their party nonetheless. 

>This has not been my experience outside of places such as Tumblr and younger feminists. Also, their.

Mansplaining, manspreading, the male gaze, Patriarchy, toxic masculinity, rape-culture, colonialism. Feminism has blamed all the ills of the world upon men - these topics cited are among the mission-statements of some of the largest Feminist advocacy groups. 

I make an honest effort to be reasonable. I like playing devil's advocate, even against my own arguments. I believe in intellectual integrity - but when I see the largest feminist advocacy groups blaming almost everything wrong in the world specifically on men, I find it hard to see how one could reasonably argue that feminism doesn't ""hate men.""

>I agree, the wage gap is dumb, but again, the vast majority of feminists neither blame nor hate men, and the issues you're listing are far more complex and nuanced than that.

Some things really aren't that complicated. Manspreading is a very clear and focused shaming campaign against men specifically. Feminism has branded masculinity itself as being inherently toxic, and the cause of the worlds ills."

The public isn't responsible for the abuses of powerful people. End of story. It doesn't matter who you vote for, the cops in NYC are a political force in and of themselves. New Yorkers found that out with ol' Bill. 

>Got anything to back that up?

 http 

There's another story like this every week. The police are a source of revenue for the city and they are instructed to ever increase the amount of that revenue. In practice this means shaking down working people and trying to find a way to take as much of their cash as possible for as many reasons as possible. Often if you haven't done anything illegal they'll make something up. And good luck trying to fight that 500 dollar bullshit ticket you got in court. 

>It's immoral until you need them when you get robbed

Oh look this shit...

The cops didn't stop me from getting robbed, did they? Oh no, they show up after the fact, act condescending, and then go back to beating the shit out of teenagers with spray paint. Meanwhile the guy who mugged me is long gone and will probably never be found. And if he was, so what? What comes off it? Some junkies gets chucked into Rikers for stealing a credit card and has his life utterly ruined, maybe dies, and what do I get out of this? Certainly not ""safety"", there's a million and one people who would steal my shit in this city. And there always was and always will be. The pool of such people self replenishes. Part of the nature of poverty and desperation. 

I don't consider the ""solutions"" of cops, generally speaking, to be solutions at all. In fact I consider them part of the problem in the vast majority of cases. 

>Then run for congress, etc. Stop bitching about it and actually do something about it.

Only thing that ever made New York somewhat livable was the people in it, in their better moments. No politician is ever going to get people to live as a community and care for each other, and you know it. 

Let me tell you a story: One on the train, I see a drunk with his shirt off running around the carriage and generally threatening to beat the face in on anybody who looked at him wrong. Truly erratic, threatening, individual who was clearly ready to commit violence.. 

We need the cops right? 

No. 

What happened was one rather large man gets up, has a cordial conversation with this crazy ass gentlemen, asks him what's wrong, and then calmly escorts him off the train. 

Now if the NYPD was involved the train would have been stopped for a long time, everybody questioned, drunk guy beat up and thrown in jail. All at massive cost to taxpayers. 

I'll take the other guy's approach. "

Doesn't mean ""I'm our Dm"" it's basically either telling the reader to put themselves in the shoes of said individual, serve as an introduction point for said individual, or simply indicate this person as the focal point of the story. It varies as the direct interpretation of its use varies. Most importantly ""Also be me"" is the clearest indicator that he's not the DM, and that they are giving a description of themselves right there. Assuming OP is not suffering from head trauma, can safely guess after this point any other descriptions will be directed at the group mates. The only bit that is, in my opinion, poorly constructed is:

>Our group: me, a guy she works/worked with, and a soon-to-be married couple.

Because it leads with ""Me"", a common thought pattern is to expect the bit following the comma to be a description of ""me"" not the beginning of a list.
I don't intend to come off as condescending or anything like that, but I don't think OP did a bad job getting his point across. Except where describing his group. And even then it's not the worst flub I've seen. Greentext isn't meant to be master prose after all.
"
"i see a lot of phrases like this thrown around as justification of tipping: 

""that's how it works here, tip or fuck off"", and ""that's how the restaurant bushiness works here in the USA, if you can't understand that then eat elsewhere"". 

i think these people have been abused for so long that they mistake ""works"" for ""works well"". just because there is a system in place, the way it works, does not equate to ""it works well"". it's more honest to say ""that's how it is"", because then how it is does not mean that's how it should be if it's not good enough. 

>That's how a business works. 

clearly not for restaurants: 

>Most restaurants are already not sustainable. 

that may be the way restaurants ""work"" in the USA, but that does not equate to them being sustainable. i will not invest in an unsustainable practice like tipping. i'll eat there, and that makes sure the other staff get paid in the kitchen and the bar, managers, etc but i will not invest into the tipping scam that continues to propagate the manager's abuse of their waiters. 

let the waiters get of their asses and riot/strike for their rights to a better wage. i see no reason why every other country is passionate enough to demonstrate exactly how they feel when unhappy with abusive regimes and practices, so why do people in the USA passively lay down and take it up the ass repeatedly? 

when did the idea of fighting for your right to desired life, with people fighting with their lives and making pledges of allegiance, to use arms to secure themselves from a corrupt government, etc all get replaced with a sense of passivity and finger-pointing ? 
since when is suing each other and blaming each other the better way ? if you want a better life for yourself, don't vilify innocent strangers who choose to accept the options your employer advertises. 

there are plenty of underpaid and over-worked jobs in the USA, and 3rd-world countries, but do us customers condescend waiters and ask them to tip the workers of the world? no, we come in for food and the service as it's advertised, and we don't abuse the waiter and call/think of them as a cheap ass because they don't sent money to Asia for all the sweat-shop workers who made the waiter's electronics and clothing. 

i have a desired lifestyle, and so does the waiter, so where the fuck does a waiter get this sense of entitlement to tell me how i should spend my money ? since when is it OK to take my wages, then add tax to what i buy WITH those left-over wages, and then waiters expect a form of ""welfare"" to go directly into their pocket ?

waiters are not that rare or skilled a resource that you can't get some one who will do the job without bitching, or eventually replaced by robots. either way waiters have no right to ""expect"" from customers, that which customers had no hand in arranging: their employers wages system. 

>I'd suggest you're eating at the wrong restaurants. If you feel like the food (and or service) is not exceptional, by all means don't go back.
 
you're missing the point, it's good enough to enjoy the food, it's not good enough to justify tipping. so i eat, pay the price leave no tip. i'm happy with the menu price, if you have a problem with that speak to your employer. i have options. i choose to eat and not tip as it is offered to me. 

if you see the customer as the cause of the low wages for waiters, you are deluded and naive. to vilify the customer is one of the very finest things any business can do to destroy itself, just look and the RIAA/MPAA, and content protection in general. the moment you start blaming your customers for your bad management, you are in trouble. 

>Your waiter has a market value, the same as any other profession. You can disagree with what that value is (and I assume you do), but the service industry is the only industry where you can take advantage of the services provided, and then determine what you're willing to pay for it. You cannot hire a lawyer and then say ""$100/hour is too much, I think I'll only give you $50/hour."" 

bullshit analogy, here's why. 

>... the American service industry is the only industry where you can take advantage of the services provided, and then determine what you're willing to pay for it. 

FTFY, don't generalise as though the USA is the only country on the planet, and that everywhere has this problem. this is a USA problem. if the lawyer is $100/ph, i can choose to pay that advertised price, what HE can't do is advertise one price, then ask for MORE on top of that because ""i have kids to feed"", etc. 

that is false advertising. you either explicitly state the price, or you don't expect to get what you didn't initially ask for. so your analogy is moot because if you want to equate a lawyer's fee, then you have to admit that waiter's do not have legally mandated fee's explicitly stated to the customer as part of the menu price that can not be negotiated. 

 
you make the product, you set the prices, you advertise the experience, and if you are still in trouble in such a way you can't pay your staff enough without asking the customer to pay more than the advertised price, then you have problems you should look to a lot closer to home. 

blaming the customer for low staff wages is the most bone-headed business mentality that explains why in the USA: >Most restaurants are already not sustainable. 

while the rest of the world has no such problems, doesn't vilify their customers, and business flourishes. 

so go on, tell me again that all the other countries with sustainable restaurants and well-paid waiters are doing it wrong, and that blaming the customer in the USA is ""how it works"".
"
">What they do as a regular user of Reddit outside of that is immaterial, and I'm not sure you can convince me otherwise.

To an extent I would agree with this. When they are reposting posts from this sub elsewhere to make fun of them or insulting and belittling posters here on another sub that crosses the line into being quite material. Also I disagree that mods are only expected to maintain a level of decorum when posting here with the tag. You don't magically stop being a moderator when you take that tag off. If someone in a position of power is being rude and condescending it's going to reflect poorly on the community whether that little M is there or not.

You asked for examples of her behaviour? Here she is calling a poster in this sub a moron, admitting abusing her position and moderating their thread because she thought they were a moron, and belittling them as a person and a parent despite being wholly ignorant of their situation.

Do with that what you will, and I'm sure it's not the only example, but the worst thing you can do is ignore it and pretend it isn't a problem. Do you really think people are comfortable posting here when one of the most active users who is also in a position of power is just ready to take their post and shit all over them in a different sub?

Edit: Another example.

Edit 2: Example of her being rude to someone on this sub. While not unprovoked it still doesn't show the level of decorum expected from a mod. Interestingly it was in reaction to someone calling her out on her condescending attitude. She also then posted it to CJC because calling them a loser here wasn't enough for her.

Edit 3: Oh hey let's use autism as an insult! What a great person you have moderating this sub! /s

Edit 4: Last one for now.

There's definitely more and I know I skipped over a few that weren't as egregious but still not really acceptable. And I'm not even going to try to crawl through her comments but I'm sure there's plenty of examples there for anyone willing to put the time in. I think I've made my, and the dozens of others complaining about Laika, case though. These opinions about her don't just come out of a vacuum. And again the worst thing you can do is ignore them, doesn't matter how much you try to spin it that you're looking at improving matters. No one is going to believe you while you stick your head in the sand and ignore the elephant in the room.

Edit 5: I just remembered a situation from a community I used to moderate years ago that's somewhat similar to this. There was a user that was active in two communities, related but separate. One was effectively the forums for a website, one was a chatroom. Neither was managed by the website though and so we were autonomous and somewhat independent of one another while sharing a lot of the same userbase. I was the admin of the chatroom (and I was originally one of the forum admins but I'd become inactive there by the time of this story) and a user that frequented that chatroom had been banned there. The mods of the forums tried to have them banned on the chatroom and I pushed back on this. Now I didn't even like this person particularly, we'd clashed a number of times on opinions and I didn't respect how they constructed arguments. But I believe in fair moderation and so I told them that while they continued to behave themselves in the chatroom they would be welcome there.

This is why I agree with you to a point. It's not a mods job to police what someone does outside their own community except when said user is attacking said community. However if this user had been using the chat to belittle and mock members of the forums they would have been banned. Had they been using the forums to belittle and mock members of the chat they would have been banned or at the very least told to knock it off. And if they were one of my mods I guarantee you I would have stripped their mod powers in a heartbeat regardless of which scenario it was. Even if I liked the person I would have done so. I've demoted mods I'd call friends before because I believed that they weren't acting responsibly. It's not fun but as an admin my responsibility was to create a welcoming community, not an insular hangout for my cronies.

At any rate if after reading all this you're still going to pretend that what laika is doing elsewhere on Reddit is irrelevant to JapanTravel then to be blunt you probably shouldn't be a moderator here either."

Trumps temperament is not good enough to be president.  
His economic policies will be bad for our economy.  
His immigration/muslim policies will not nearly be as effective as he claims they are, furthermore, the immigration/muslim problems are not nearly as big as he claims.  
He would be way too thinskinned and way too easily baited to be commander in chief.  
He is borderline racist and often comes across as sexist.  
Trump (his policies/supreme court picks) will not be kind to LGBT people.

">I feel like I can't break up with him because no one would like to have the chance of herpes in their genitals from one blowjob you know.

This is a very irrational belief. Remember that more than half of all people have oral hsv1! And on top of that, many people who have it don't know they have it. For the vast majority of people out there, having a partner with oral hsv1 is a non-issue. It is *not* the case that people with oral hsv1 have any problem finding partners because of having oral hsv1.

>Idk I feel like I probably have it genitally.. hopefully I don't. 

It is *extremely* unlikely that you also have it genitally. Once you are infected with a type of herpes in one location, you become largely protected from getting infected with the same type of herpes in another location at a later point in time. This is because after you are first infected with herpes, your body creates antibodies to fight the virus. Your body maintains these antibodies in your bloodstream and they protect you from further infection. Different people generate antibodies at different rates, but by about 4 months post-infection the vast majority of people will have enough antibodies to prevent any further infection by the same type. Many people will have sufficient antibodies a lot sooner than that (eg after several weeks).

There are very rare exceptions to the above but that is the general rule.

>I suffer from depression and chronic anxiety so finding someone else at the moment or even the thought of dating and getting myself or there is not a possibility.

I see. That can be very challenging. Are you working with a therapist at all? That can sometimes help very substantially. It is very likely that your depression and anxiety are influencing your current mindset regarding oral hsv1, and your beliefs about your relationship options as well. You can talk with a therapist about anything. Whether it be your depression and anxiety in general, or oral hsv1 specifically. Some people who have never been to a therapist before think ""oh, I could never talk about 'that'! It's too personal and embarrassing"". But those things are exactly the kinds of thing that therapists are professionally trained to talk with you about.

>He's verbally abusive sometimes.

I'm glad that you're aware of this. It's important to understand how harmful verbal abuse can be. It can be even more harmful then physical abuse. It can contribute very substantially to a victim's depression and anxiety, and prolong it. Chronic verbal abuse (ie that continues over a significant period of time) can also change the victim's perceptions of themselves. It can cause them to lose their frame of reference and objectivity, and instead their thinking can become very negatively skewed and biased (against themselves) without their realizing it. It is likely part of the reason that you feel that ""dating and getting myself out there is not a possibility"".

There is an excellent book I would recommend to you on verbal abuse: *The Verbally Abusive Relationship: How to recognize it and how to respond*, by Patricia Evans. Here is a link to it on Amazon: LINK. I suspect you would find this book very informative and helpful.

Please consider working with a therapist if you aren't already. And know that having oral hsv1 should make virtually no difference in your ability to find a healthy/respectful partner. "

"> I think a lot of the MMO feel came from the leveling process being way longer and having people spread amongst far less continents, zones, and even quests in the zones themselves.

On a parallel note, I think the charm of vanilla was that at any time during those first couple years, you could log in and see players experiencing very new things every single day. And this continued into BC and Wrath; partly because new players were joining every day and having to go through a similar leveling grind to everyone else and partly because even at max level, gear and reputations were so significant that within that group of of max level players, two different people could almost be playing a completely different game. 

It took a few years for the playerbase to catch up to one another, between relaxing the leveling grind and implementing things like LFR. Now we're all playing the same game. Which is good in many ways, but the cork's left the bottle. We're never going to recapture that spark that was so crucial to what a lot of people consider the ""MMO experience"" because everyone is on the same field playing the same game. "

"> arguable that he will become the best basketball player of all time over Jordan, if he isn't the greatest already. 

Seriously, people keep saying this, but how is anyone going to surpass Jordan unless they get basically all of these:

* 7 NBA championship titles
* 7 NBA Finals MVP titles
* 6 NBA MVP titles
* 10+ NBA Scoring championships
* Multiple offensive and defensive player of the year titles
* Olympic gold
* Single handedly repeatedly carry your team across the finish line
* Multiple times light up your biggest foes in dramatic fashion: ""I'm back"" -- lights up the Knicks for 55. Wins a Finals game sidelined by flu. The Shot over Ehlo in Cleveland. The Shot 2 to win the third three-peat. 25 buzzer beaters to win games in his career, including one for a championship. Not just once--got to the well repeatedly to win games and playoff series nearly on your own.

That would arguably put someone ahead of Jordan, since players are ranked in the history books on achievements, not on skill or power. Look at in baseball, at Barry Bonds, all the steroids crap aside. Fifty years from now he'll be a footnote in the record books, because: no title. Once you get to guys with multiple titles, then you start getting elite. Then you have to compare them against the sum total of their achievements.

Because, as seen here, then championships alone don't do it. If Lebron can win 7 championships, he'll pick up the other accolades, in all likelihood. Kobe came closest since Jordan to the title of Greatest Ever, and he's fallen a bit short as well. 

Don't get me wrong, LeBron is and will be one of the greatest of all time. Top 10, for sure. Top 5, *easily*, if he can win 2-3 more titles, up there with Jordan, Bird, Johnson, Jabbar. But number one?

What does LeBron have at age 27 and with just one title over Jordan, with his entire career and six titles?"

"> Even assuming all possible medical attention is necessary, deserved, and cannot be avoided by individual decision making, and not dependent on age, gender, habits, and with costs equally generated by the whole population (again, very, very much not so),

A nitpick here. ""Universal healthcare"" doesn't need to be an all-encompassing package. According to wikipedia ""it is organized around providing a specified package of benefits to all members of a society with the end goal of providing financial risk protection, improved access to health services, and improved health outcomes."" I don't disagree with your point about the money having to come from *somewhere*, but there's a big difference between guaranteeing care for reasonably unavoidable incidents (many types of cancer and assault/accidents caused by others come to mind immediately) and guranteeing care for things that can be chalked up to poor decisions^1 (lung cancer from smoking, self-inflicted wounds, preventable diseases). 

Otherwise, I agree that it's not the government's job to provide security that individuals could provide themselves. At the same time, inequity can be tackled from the other end. Existing IP laws can lead to situations such as the recent daraprim price hike because a company bought the right to produce the drug and therefore controls the price. Personally, I believe that the government ought to prevent individuals and companies from abusing property rights to take advantage of other citizens. While there's a legitimate argument to be made for protecting the rights of the individuals & companies that create a product (encouraging them to innovate for profit), there's a lot less argument to be made for the ability of a company to buy rights to a product it did not create. Balancing protections for creators and prevention of systemic abuse is its own challenge, of course.

^1 The idea of ""poor decisions"" is contingent on how much opportunity someone has to be informed on their decisions, and so can be a pretty relative term. But how the government should be involved in providing such information is its own sort of tangent. Warning labels, such as those on cigarettes, seem to be more than sufficient for any literate person to be informed and relatively low-effort for the government. It's hard to argue any smoker in the US is uninformed of the risks of smoking, and thus hard to argue that they deserve treatment for complications created by smoking."

"Apparently you have no idea to what degree mods can change the game. 

Let's examine each of your claims:

>""Making it beautiful won't change the fact there are more bandit camps with a bigger population than most towns.""

Presently, there are about a dozen mods which add hundreds of NPCs to the towns of skyrim, expand cities and add new merchants and houses, and even add new sounds to make things seem livelier. I don't use any. I don't spend too much time in towns whining about how empty they are.

>""Dragons (wyverns) only come in two styles, fire breathing or ice breathing.""

Deadly dragons and skyrim monster mod add dozens of types of dragons unique in appearance, attack style, defenses, and breath attacks. These new breath attacks include every offensive shout avaliable to the player, poison shouts, force shouts, summoning allies, even causing eruptions from the ground that spew fire projectiles. Skyrim monster mod even adds another 120 or so lore friendly monsters to the game that expand the levelled lists. You can find wraiths in dungeons, daedra of all stripes near conjurers and necromancers. Instead of just draugr in undead dungeons, you have a pool of about 20 unique types of enemies that aren't just upgraded versions of the same foe, more than almost any base game anywhere. Now apply that variety of unique enemies to every single enemy group and you'll understand how much mods add in that regard.

>""you saved the ________, so you're leader now.""

Even in the base game, while this is the final goal, the pathway to that goal is utterly unique. The questlines of the various guilds aren't even remotely similar, nor are the enemies you generally face. That said, there are mods that add more content and gameplay to every guild that extends beyond the end of the questline.

>""They removed any (all) customization and mechanics that would prove too hard for the broader audience and replaced (word used loosely) with a retard-proof way to make sure your character can never be useless.""

Not only is that blatantly untrue, what with the smithing improvement, unique enchantments, varied fighting styles, variety of spells, shouts, and powers, even if it had a grain of truth, mods rectify the situation that you perceive. There are mods that add enhanced mechanics for literally every play style. Even if you were only to consider the top 3 magic mods, there are no less than 400 spells that are entirely unique in effect, animation, and use both from each other and from every spell in the basic game. There are mods that entirely change perk trees to better balance the game and allow greater customization. There are even mods already that literally rewrite the entire perk system from the ground up as the author felt was best. There are new enchantements. There are sneak attack system rewrites. There are dozens of new potions with completely unique effects. There are a few thousand new weapons with unique appearances, damages, swing speeds, weights, and effects. There are hundreds of complete sets of armor that are just as unique as the weapons, usually moreso.

TLDR; you have no idea what you're talking about at all and you really should just shut the fuck up before you embarrass yourself further. Bethesda releases the exact tools they use to create the game. If someone really wanted to he or she could make a new game from the ground up, sharing nothing with the base game at all. That happened back in oblivion (Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, fucking google it). It just might in skyrim.

By the way, if any of you played oblivion on the PC and still have it installed, I recommend getting nehrim. It's free and a pretty good game."

"> There is one international law.

Excellent. Kindly point me to the text of this ""one and only international law"".

I'll save you time. No such thing exists. International laws are an amalgam of written treaties and unwritten customs. That's why US is so afraid of letting China establish a precedent in South China Sea on EEZ projection from dredged up islands. They do it, it becomes customary international law.

Same reason there is so much opposition to way Kosovo gained independence and Crimea got annexed.

Drone strikes are strictly illegal under old definitions of international law. US had to bend them severely, establish a long list of precedents and as such, change customary law.

That said, as US rejects authority of ICC, there's no real court that can address this issue either.

>If the terrorists are only available targets when they are with their families, then the strikes may actually be legal, despite civilian losses.

""If enough Crimean agree, Crimean annexation may be legal"".

It's called ""establishing sufficient precedent"" in international law. It does not change the fact that it challenges established law, from point of which, action is in fact illegal until customs are changed.

>The US doesn't just decide them based on domestic law...

That is in fact exactly how US originally argued for them.

>No, it shoots civilian areas to cause destruction and force the opposition to lose vantage points.

"> I just have enough sense to realize it’s not intended to be permanent employment

No,  you have enough sense to not understand the economy. If you think people flipping burgers do so because they want to you are simply wrong. If you think minimum wage hurts the economy you are wrong, otherwise Western Europe wouldn't be a power house. You think Germany pays peanuts to their workers, or do you know they have a higher effective min. wage than the US? Germany one of the top 3 exporters in the world, has a higher minimum wage than the two higher exporters. If min wage was tied to exporting then Spain would be a larger exporter. 

What we have here is that you not understanding how an economy works. You probably got through your Econ 101 course and suddenly knew everything I guess. They never taught you that Econ 101 is basically wrong when you get to the real world. People aren't ideal buyers, which is why An-Caps are constantly wrong. Externalities effect us all which is why taxes on somethings are needed. 

There are no credible papers deconstructing why we should go back to slavery because it's not good for the economy. What is good is an increased level of parity between the richest and the most poor, as history constantly shows us. Giving people work improves the economy, not 5 people fighting for a single job.

"> Drunk driving is being reckless and putting others at risk.

The point is that this statement is not necessarily true. First, you have to define ""drunk driving"". The blood alcohol level varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is all too often arrived at arbitrarily and does not account for individual capacity. As Lew Rockwell's article points out, many people are able to drive just fine while intoxicated and others actually drive *better*.

If you determine that drunk driving in general generates a certain amount of risk, why not criminalize all other behaviors that match that risk level? Also, does criminalizing the activity even do anything to reduce it? It's a fact that DUI checkpoints do not reduce drunk driving accidents. So why have them?

When you get right down to it, I think there is a much wiser policy approach that, while not ideal, is better than what we currently have. Focusing on actual, overt, risky *behavior* instead of simply the chemicals in one's blood is a more sensible approach and would have a more significant positive effect, as proposed here:

> Like you're the driver? All that bullshit on the side you call ""experience"" is smoke and mirrors. It's a joke and it's sad you fell for it.

Even that is more than just simple racing. I am more than willing to take a realism hit (25% maximum) as long as everything else is done well. It's what makes it less boring. Story and immersion over the action itself. There's a good reason why I don't watch GP2, FR3.5 or other lower leagues even though they have equal or better racing compared to F1.

The only thing I agree with from your entire post is 2012 being bad. They improved the gamepad controls so more people could play it, but that was at the cost of two practice sessions, three online practice sessions, tyre scaling, most of the immersive stuff etc. 

They made the game objectively worse - you can't even bring out the safety car. No such problems in 2011. But that doesn't mean I can't look forward to 2013. If they make reasonable improvements then it'll be worth acquiring.

>Just because you suck at driving a real racing sim doesn't mean they are bland.

There are two problems with the genre actually. Aside from it being bland (all you do is drive by yourself, maybe online, that's it, nothing else about it), it costs a metric shitton for anyone to even get a good shot at entering the genre. A decent setup costs a small fortune - even just getting an acceptable wheel will set you back by quite a bit. And don't even get me started on iRacing's subscription costs. It's a niche, expensive genre that doesn't even do its job right - Project CARS is a disappointment, rFactor 2 will likely still be behind iRacing in the physics department, and even iRacing itself is quite imperfect and slowly aging, even with Barrichello playing it quite a bit."

>Did you notice that the majority of his hate was based around women? About how white girls shouldn't be hanging out with coloured men? Yes, there was racist hatred for coloured and Asian men there - but the majority of it was based on the fact that girls were hanging out with them, and not him. He was just another 'red pill' type of guy who thought women should be fawning over him because he was such a nice guy - and when they didn't he got angry. 

Those aren't red pill beliefs, for the record.  They're actually intensely counter to the red pill ideology.  While red pill has an **awful** ton of misogyny to be found in its comments and many member statements, the actual core of the movement, which can be seen in many places, is to blame *yourself* if you're not attracting women.  It says ""Women are this way, the world is this way, and you are the common element in your failed relationships.  Play the game and get good at it.""

That may be a terrible thing to say, but it's very much not about shifting blame to women for not sleeping with you.  If you're Red Pill, you say they're only following their natures and change yourself.

As for the majority of his hate, no, I deny it was based around women.  He was a straight virgin who wanted to fuck women, so he talked about them, but the core of his character was hate for absolutely everyone, family included.

>Oh, so men suffering is just a result of other men? Not of the society that women have to deal with? Okay then. And yes, you're right - wanting the same rights and respect as men is Idealogical. Sorry, I was obviously dreaming there.

Men suffering is a result of myriad elements that make up our culture, including other men and women, various political institutions, religious ones, etc., etc.

>Um, yes, they are. They might be declining, but that doesn't mean they're not still ridiculously high. In New Zealand (where I live) one in three girls will experience some form of sexual assault before they turn sixteen. One in five women will experience it as an adult. That's the statistics for the reported assaults - and only 9% is ever reported. 

I can't speak about New Zealand.  I don't live there and it's of no concern to me.  In the United States, the rates of rape (and all violent crimes) have been falling significantly for a long while.  Hell, in the US, the most often raped demographic is men, but you don't really hear a lot of people saying it's abundant or a huge deal; it's the smaller issue that plagues women you hear about.

>If it is a men's issue, then why aren't men fixing it? More men are raped in prison then women outside of it, so why aren't you doing anything?! Doesn't that make you angry?! Doesn't that make you sick to your stomach? Because every time I read in the papers or online or watch on the news that someone - man or woman - has been raped, it honestly makes me feel physically ill. How can you not want to stop that? 

What would you like me to do?  I don't actually have any power whatsoever in this world.  My wallet's empty, none of my friends are important, I have no influential family name.  I'll gladly lend my voice to any speaking out about this, help spread awareness, tell people my stance, support those who can do more.. not really anything else that's within my abilities.

As for being made sick about it: no, not really.  I object to it on an intellectual level but it's not like I know any of the people suffering.  They don't resonate emotionally.

>Rape culture is the trivialisation of rape and it is something that affects everyone, not just women. Prison rape can only be included in that. I don't know why there are so many more rapes in prison than outside of it - I imagine it is because putting a lot of possibly violent people in one place would just reduce sex as another weapon. Look, just because there are more people dying of heart disease doesn't mean you stop researching and treating lung cancer. It's just one more issue that needs to be addressed and fixed. 

Rape culture **could** refer to that, but it doesn't, and you damn well know that.  Rape Culture is used specifically to address the problems women face, largely -- they allege -- at men's hands.  Prison rape is not something feminists are fighting or talking about.

As for what you research and treat, aid is zero-sum.  There's a finite amount of time and resources you can devote to any given thing, and the more you invest in X the less that's available for Y.  Every group has to pick and choose.  I don't fault feminism for focusing on women.  That's better for the group.  

>Yes, you do need more than feelings to convict. There's this thing called a rape kit, which is used to gather semen, skin (from under the victims nails where they have scratched at their attacker) and other evidence. In New Zealand, it is free to get a rape kit done (in hospital, or local GP, or even by police). In America, it costs around $800. And for a lot of people, that's a lot of money. Not to mention the costs of lawyers if the case actually gets to court. So is it any wonder that so many rape cases are 'he said she said'?

Rape kits cannot actually prove rape.  What a rape kit can prove is that sexual congress took place, but the actual matter of consent is divorced from that.  They're a useful tool for establishing sex ever happened, though.

> So is it any wonder that so many rape cases are 'he said she said'? And I agree with you - it is incredibly hard to prosecute when there are cases where women are saying men raped them when they didn't. But just because those cases are happening, doesn't give police the right to ignore actual cases of rape on the off chance that she's lying, or even worse - implying that if she's been drinking, coming from the 'wrong part of town' or is showing 'too much skin' that she had it coming! It's not just a matter of it being difficult to get evidence - it's a matter of victim blaming, trivialisation of sexual assault and, sometimes, victims just being too fucking traumatised and ashamed to get help.

Police do not have the right to ignore cases.  That said, they do need to exercise discretion, and investigate, and question.  These things happen with every crime, not just rape.  And unlike those crimes, when there is good reason to believe a sexual assault happened (and even when there's not), the alleged perpetrator is **condemned**, socially at the minimum, and legally in other cases.  Those events where that's not the case (such as, uh, Steubenville?), get incredible nation-wide publicity and universally revilement and condemnation from everyone else.

Sexual assault is not trivialized.  Rape is not trivialized.  The exact opposite is what's true: rape has been blown up into quite possibly the single worst thing that can ever happen to someone and the single worst thing you could ever do to someone, which is patently absurd.  It's not even in the top ten.

>So women can be masculine, but men can't be feminine? You've just proved my point! Why isn't it okay for a man to 'give manliness up'? It's because lack of masculinity implies femininity. That's the issue.

No, I haven't proved your point.  It's not okay for a man to give it up because they don't have the right to.  Choice and freedom like that are not privileges men are allotted.  A king can dress like a peasant, but a peasant can never dress like a king.  A man must be manly because that is what he is, he has a role to fulfill, and deviation from it is unacceptable.  

>That's the same as saying it's okay to aspire to be a man, but not to be a woman. That in society, women can wear pants and be see as normal, but men can't wear skirts for fear of being seen as weird. Do you see what I'm saying here? 

I see what you're saying.  It's simply wrong.  It's *not* the same as saying that; it's saying men don't have the right to deviate.  It's not a statement on the value of masculinity vs femininity.  Femininity is much more valuable than masculinity to society.

>That's like telling a black person that racism doesn't exist. We are less in society. Just because you don't experience it, doesn't mean it's not happening. I've given you examples (less pay, femininity used as an insult, lack of women in positions of power or as world leaders, blatant sexism . These are ways in which we are less. These are some of the things that contribute to rape culture. 

You are not less in society.  The pay gap is largely a myth, with the numbers being a result of terrible polling methods and shitty studies.  Femininity is not an insult.  The insult is *deviation from masculinity*, because a man's sole worth is his ability to embody that ideal (men are prisoners, and prisoners have restricted rights).  The gender of world leaders is irrelevant -- that is an example of the apex fallacy and an ignorance as to the values of indirect power vs direct power.  

None of those things contribute to rape culture because rape culture doesn't exist.

>I am telling you that I am right because these things are what I have experienced.

Your feelings are not a compelling argument.  I honestly don't care about them in the slightest.  I care about facts, numbers, societal trends, power (im)balances.  Your feels are not included in that list.

>This is what all women experience.

I need only find a single woman who disagrees to prove this wrong.  Never generalize like that.

With such high powers given to key players, it gets difficult for newbies to enter the market.

You are confused between the marketplace and the production place. Gujarat isnt a market, but is the producer of goods. And this study judges (IMHO) which state will be easier to do business in - focusing largely on how easy it is for any company to bring in FDI and set up shop in a given state.

">Is the author stating that a notion of self stems directly from papañca?

I think he's saying it is certainly tied up with it. It might be more correct to say that papanca *is* the self; that is, what we think of as the self is really this feedback loop called papanca. It's an infinite loop, a glitch, a bug. How to break it?

From previous patterns of thinking (sankhara) arises and is shaped the present thought. This present thought abides for but a moment and ceases, laying down tracks for the next thought to follow.

One kind of pattern of thinking could be this ouroboric kind called papanca. As papanca proliferates the tracks laid down get deeper and deeper, and harder and harder to escape from. Like a wheel gets stuck in a rut. The rut here is one filled with these categories mentioned, so whatever presents itself is quickly labeled and pigeonholed: this is mine/not mine; I like this/not that.

The notion of a permanent self is abstracted out of this labeling activity.

>Or are there other factors involved in the creation of self not mentioned?

I think other factors influencing the kind of papanca (or self-creation) that is occurring would be the defilements, poisons, afflictions, etc. 

E.g, sensual lust, IMO, is a type of papanca. There is a sensory experience, and because of the presence of the ""seeds of lust"" one chases after that sensory experience: one *compounds* sensation upon sensation. It isn't enough to see the pretty girl, you want to see more of her; it isn't enough to see more of her, you must touch her; it isn't enough to touch her, you must possess her; it isn't enough to possess her, you want to possess all girls.

This creates a very monstrous self: the horn dog.

Stopping all of this is done by first becoming aware of the process of the laying down of these tracks over and over again, which is creating great habits, deep ruts.

Like you have noticed, you can only work with this in the present moment, with the present thought. So, the idea, IMO, is to not let the present thought which was shaped by the previous thought continue the cycle. This, I think, is why *cessation* is essential to the Buddhist practice. You have to stop the ouroboric thought from completing itself. Nip it in the bud, so it will not blossom like the last one did. 

You don't want to let this thought ""just be"" because then it would just continue its proliferation which is causing you stress.

This is accomplished, IMO, through willpower, discipline, concentration, wisdom and the like.

For example, if the two opinions are ""It is correct to believe that there is a god"" and ""It is not correct to believe that there is a god"", then the law of excluded middle says that you *can't* both be wrong.

A Hollow soul was injected into them (possibly in the same way Yhwach's soul has been injected into some Shinigami, by having the souls ""laid around"") which mingled with their own souls, before being stabilized by Urahara's vaccine before Soul Suicide could occur.

I *completely* missed that.  The parallel to Yhwach's insertions is quite a bit more apt, then.

> Though it's clear that the existing Zanpakutou spirit (or at least its body) influenced the Hollow soul, as evidenced by Tousen's Resurreccion whose appearance and abilities are heavily referential to Suzumushi's own themes.

Hmm...perhaps the inserted Hollow was able to integrate itself into the existing amalgam?  If the two (Hollow, Zanpakuto) become one, it brings the Vizard situation that much closer to Ichigo's, and helps explain why their method worked for him in pretty much the exact way they expected (including the external Hollowification during the event).

Nobody. You think the fact that Miyamoto got hired means that Yamauchi seriously saw Miyamoto's potential? Yamauchi knew what he had in Miyamoto? Give me a break.

I never said they were in third place, although actually GameCube did come in third place behind PS2 and Xbox. Dreamcast was fourth place.

And no, you are wrong, GameCube was Yamauchi. When Iwata stepped in, GameCube was already out, and it struggled because of a lack of third party support (due to mini discs) and basically no online. That's all on Yamauchi. He oversaw the development and launch of the GameCube. Mini discs and no online aren't things Iwata could have undone once the console was on shelves."

"> Sometimes I wonder what people like that think mental illness is.

I don't know where someone said that being suicidal can *not*, or is not ultimately caused by mental illness. After all, if you don't want to live anymore, then there is something in your life that is not *great*, like a chronic physical illness, or a mental illness. I guess your point is that people who are mentally ill and suicidal are incapable of making such a decision since they are mentally ill. But, and someone who actually knows something about things like depression (medically speaking, and not just having experienced it) correct me if I'm wrong, but the desire to do something doesn't inherently disqualify you from making an informed decision about what to do about it. Though the desire to end your life might be heavily influenced by your mental state, the brain is multi-faceted and still capable of carrying out rational thoughts, unless I'm mistaken.

>  I mean, your brain lying to you and saying it would be better if you were dead is basically the definition of depression

The brain only knows life. Death is beyond its knowing. So it can be argued that the brain can not *lie* about the relative merits of suicide, since the outcome of that decision reaches beyond what is knowable to it. In fact, does the brain know the whole picture with regards to something like the long-term view of ones mental and emotional state? If someone is really suicidal, they might exaggerate and think of the future as worse and more bleak than what it is likely to be. The flip-side is that the brain isn't magically exempt from bias in the other direction. People are able to rationalize and falsely believe that ""things will get better"", while in reality it might not. In effect they might live miserable but still barely serviceable lives. Bias can work in either direction, and non-mentally ill people aren't free from it. [In fact, aren't many of the people in that thread who are against suicide-as-a-choice still suffering from depression? Or maybe they have recurring depression but aren't currently suffering from it.]

>  Also, I'm pretty sure ""yeah, your life does actually suck and will never improve so you should just give up"" is up there with ""Just be happy! Think about the starving orphans!"" for the worst possible things to say to someone depressed.

This is also a complete fabrication and straw man. Believing that people should be able to decide if they live or die has nothing to do with how inclined they are to believe that people who are suicidal should just ""give up"". One can believe in the former, and still actively and vigorously try to convince someone to not kill themself. There is no contradiction.

Your statement is like calling people who are pro-choice for being pro-always-abortion.

">The definition of rape obviously has it's problems, and that is because there is a ridiculously disproportionate amount of rape commited by men then by female.

That makes no sense. If you would, you're saying that IF 90% of thefts were committed by people of color, that the legal definition of theft should include that it can only be committed by a person of color? That makes no sense, all it does is let the people whom do not fit that description commit that crime with nothing to worry about, it does nothing to HELP society, but instead helps CRIMINALS, because you and I, law-abiding citizens, could one day come home to find a bunch of white people in our home stealing our stuff, and we can't do anything about it because it's not illegal, if we try to physically stop them then that'd be assault. Laws are made to protect SOCIETY from people whom wish to harm it, it doesn't matter if 99% of people who do a crime that harms others fit into category X, to say that people of category Y are allowed to commit that crime because they aren't category X, even though the fact that the crime occurred and everything is still exactly the same, is nothing short of stupid, and honestly, what a rape apologist would do given the context we're talking about (I do apologize very much for that sorta accusation, I understand VERY much that you don't go around trying to defend known rapists, whether most or few of them, but, while a rather charged statement, I do believe there are some ideas to that statement worth considering).

Also, you have it backwards, more men are rapists (to such a huge extent) BECAUSE the definition doesn't classify women as rapists, or at least if you go by the CDC, which, since it's apart of the government, I would expect the FBI to go by it. Study: http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf Analysis: http://i.imgur.com/wd4XiOd.jpg As demonstrated if they used a proper definition of rape, male and female victims of rape would be the same, and thus in turn by having that biased definition ~50% of rapists (whether all of those are women or just a some of them, since man A could force man B to put man B's penis inside man A, and then this act of rape would still not legally be rape by such a definition)walk around free (perhaps to rape again, which is also why I said ~50%, since not so clear the average victim count with rapists whom utilize envelopment).

As for your point about Boko Haram, I will admit the news definitely cannot cover everything, and while I hate it, due to the world that the media exists in, I will admit, I don't expect them to make a big deal over hundreds of people being killed, or rather a fuss bigger than other people being kidnapped when the latter would draw more viewership, but one must also remember about Michelle Obama's role, she is not the media, and yet we've got people DIEING and all that's really commented on is other being kidnapped? The government goes out of it's way to save people who live and breathe, but does nothing while more boys and men are slaughtered? That's just sick if you ask me (doing nothing to help people dieing, but having resources to try to help a smaller number of people whom still live), they are valuing people whom are in less danger and for what? Given all the talk about 'bring back our GIRLS' I would sit here and think that it's the fact that it's their gender that changes the evaluation.

Yes I remember Kony, but as well that wasn't entirely about boys, there was also quite a bit of talk about the girls who were taken into being sex slaves and all. Generally when that aspect was talked about it carried a lot more disgust in it than the boys being taken into the army. I will admit though, I find that appropriate, but generally I see all the Kony stuff together as an issue of how it dealt with children and the extreme amount of it (and who's to say that it wasn't that Kony was an outlier in the attention it gave boys suffering, the presumption as to which is natural, the Boko Haram focus on girls, or the Kony focus on boys/neutral focus, however you consider it, depends on other incidents, neither makes a pattern in of itself). I'm not saying that men receive no consideration, but merely their consideration comes second to that of women.

As well, it's not like Boko Haram formed my entire viewpoint (in fact I had my entire viewpoint entirely before I ever heard of Boko Haram), it's apart of many things, of the ones that I listed, and even ones of which I haven't. If the ONLY reason that I'd have to think that boys and men are seen as disposable was Boko Haram, you'd be right to say that I'm losing sight of things, after all, shit happens, sometimes for better or worse, but I've seen a clear and consistant pattern of women being valued more than men.

Music was never a focal point of the show (maybe I'm wrong though, because I didn't watch much past 93-94).

In my view, the best evidence that TRW was not part of the music landscape was that it was the genesis for the removal of actual music from the programming lineup of MTV.  When the executives saw how cheap reality programming was, and how high the ratings were, they realized they could make more money by airing stuff like TRW, Jackass, etc.  If anything, TRW directly led to the *decline* of music culture by killing one of the premier outlets for actual music on television."

"Ooh cool a strike game? Can I play?

> Then surely you can provide a more plausible premise for WHY a contingent universe exists (not how)?

Strike 1. You completely misunderstand the objection.  That's probably my fault.

The problem with the statement is that I don't think there is a better explanation.  But the explanation given is without justification.  The fact that it's asserted as the best, is completely subjective.  

The author of the premise presupposed God and just placed him there as the contingency because he subjectively liked him there.

I can play this unjustified game too.

My Premise is that Tinker Bell is the best explanation.  This tinker bell is not omnipotent, not omniscient. But she does have the ability to create universes by fluttering her fairy wings against the multiverse medium to create universes.

This explanation is better than the God explanation because tinker bell doesn't suffer from the same logical problems that come with omniscience and omnipotence.  It also minimally meets the need of the premise, as her ability to simply create universes is all that's needed for contingency to be met.  Also she's way cuter.  As for why? Tinkerbell thinks universes are sparkly and pretty, so she creates a lot of em.

Ridiculous right? You should be able to see why the subjective nature of placing God in the premise and has no justification.   The logic would be better given as.  P2) There is a cause of a universe. P3) There for a universe has a cause.  And that's as far as we can go with it.  The only honest answer is that cause is currently unknowable, and interjecting a being that you might like there and think is ""best"" isn't a good method of explaining reality.  Reality isn't subjective on our whims.

> Um, no you can't - and won't.

> Oh really? A Universe can exists before it exists to cause it's own existence.

General relatively allows for closed timelike curves where casual determinism breaks down.  These haven't been ruled out yet. It's a cosmological grandfather paradox.  Further more it's not illogical, it's just REALLY unintuitive.   The more we learn about reality and the deeper it goes the more unintuitive we find it to be.  In a way our minds are still so primitive.  The biggest problem with calling something illogical is logic can only be based on a set of premises we know about.  A lot of discovery has been made since Aquinas time, and I wonder if he'd be making the same arguments today as he formulated 800 years ago.

"> So your justification for this interference in the family unit is, well it could be worse, at least they're not mandatorily aborting foetuses or killing babies?

To an extent, yes.  Aborting foetuses or euthanising neonates is, in my view, an acceptable yet unsavoury solution.

Negative emotion and harm to the parents from separation, yes, but one can weight their negative utility more lightly since they made either an active or negligent choice to procreate in the full knowledge that they couldn't afford a child and were therefore inviting the negative utility, and weight the positive utility of the end result for the child more heavily since it has a ""good"" upbringing (note the quotes please, I make no judgement as to what ""good"" actually means outside the context of being financially stable), will have no negative feelings at the separation since it will be too young to lay down those memories and is the ""innocent"" party in what has transpired.

Helping the vulnerable in society is all well and good, but the methodology of how that's done is very difficult.  In this discussion I'm suggesting that the maximum utility lies with relocation of the child with adoptive parents rather than handing out cash that may or may not be used for its intended purpose and which, on its own, will not feed and clothe a child and where the child will have a sub-par upbringing in a life of relative poverty compared to what it could have had if adopted."

It bothers me because we do see these diseases return, and it doesn't seem like ""just a few"" people doing it if it is enough to harm the herd immunity of society. The only few that shouldn't be vaccinating are those with legitimate medical reasons not to, such as being allergic to vaccine ingredients, for example. Those people's immunity to diseases rely on the immunity of everyone else, so I'm exactly comfortable with letting people be able to refuse vaccines when they have no medical reason to.

In the links that I posted earlier, it shows that when vaccine levels drop, diseases come back, so if more people decided to refuse vaccines, diseases will come back, and their damage will have a positive relationship with those who refuse vaccines."

It just kind of reinforces the whole men-are-doers-women-are-window-dressing dynamic.

"> Millenials will purchase properties priced fairly relative to their incomes.

I think what we're starting to see is that there won't be any such properties. The wealthy will have their unreasonably priced shitty McMansions & real estate spectators will buy up everything else to become landlords to the millenial renters. Some parts of the country are already seeing this as foreign money buys up cheap properties, with the sole intention of renting them out.

This has already happened with elder care [something else that is priced artificially high & you'd think is ripe for a correction]. A lot of our country's nursing homes are not owned by health care companies, but rather these big real estate investment firms, who see it as just another way of collecting ""rent"" from people. There was a story a few months ago out of Iowa where a US Navy Vet was evicted from his nursing home & dumped off to die when he couldn't pay. The nursing home involved was owned by a huge national real estate speculation firm, out of FL. They don't know, nor care, about health care. All they want is their rent money. When the guy couldn't pay they got the cheapest apartment they could find for a couple months, with nothing in it [no phone, food, medicine, etc] and dumped him off there expecting him to die before being found & not have anyone track it back to them. Luckily a neighbor found him before he died from lack of medical care, which was how the story became news. "

">I have never heard of gay rights activists opposing state governments defining marriage and wanting a federal definition instead.

First of all, it should just be assumed that a gay person would want rights to be federally recognized. The burden is on you to prove otherwise. It is just patently ridiculous to think that it might be the case. A black person doesn't want his rights to differ based on which state he's in. He wants nationally recognized civil rights. Same for gay people. Duh. This is just *obvious* to any non-bigot.

As for gay rights activists opposing state governments defining marriage, how about looking at all the various states that have passed anti-gay marriage laws. Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin, California. Gay rights activists have taken to the court systems to get those overturned *and they've been winning*. 

>The world in which a gay person wants their state government to define marriage to include same-sex couples is the current world.

The gay person wants their *federal* government to say that gay marriage is legal and recognized. They will take the state rulings for now because it's better than nothing, but how on earth can you say with a straight face that they wouldn't 100% rather it to be a nationally recognized issue? Again, on what fucking planet do people want their fundamental rights to differ based on what piece of dirt they're standing on? 

Go to the /r/lgbt sub and ask them ""Would you rather have to fight state by state to get gay marriages recognized or would you rather the federal government just come in and say that it is?"" Really. Which side do you think they would come down on? 

Do you think blacks wanted slavery done state by state? Civil rights? Surely they would *gladly accept* a state saying slavery wasn't legal there. It offers them a safe haven. But tell me now, with a straight face, that they wouldn't 100% prefer that it was just nationally banned. That their rights would be nationally guaranteed. Tell me right now that they prefer the states' rights method.

"> I see! So it's no affront to your ideology for communism to exist, then go away, then exist again, as circumstances change. That makes me a little less confused. However, I would like to share some thoughts on post-scarcity, which seems to be a rather crucial pillar of support for communism as I understand it.

Well, communism ""going away"" would be comparable to a modern industrial capitalist society ""going away"" and being replaced by pre-capitalist forms of production and bartering (which is starting to happen in Greece due to the crisis btw) - it could only be the result of a massive catastrophe, but of course it's not impossible per se. Nothing is. In fact we've seen humanity's first attempt at emancipation go horribly wrong with Stalinism and all that followed. That makes it very likely that things won't go smoothly the next time either; we can pretty much expect there to be drawbacks and failures along the road.

> There cannot be a sustained population of humans that does not produce more food than they need. This is because food production fluctuates, and the sustained population is limited to what can be supported by the lower bound. The average food production will always be higher than the lower bound, and since fluctuations in food production are quite significant, it will be significantly higher. If post-scarcity is defined as producing a lot more of the stuff we require to live than we need, then all agrarian societies have been 'post scarcity'... right up until something happens that significantly reduces food output.

I think we should clear up what ""need"" means. The reproduction of humanity is not merely a reproduction of its bare existence. We don't merely aim to *physically survive*, but to *reproduce ourselves as social beings*, as Marx says. Reproduction as social beings means that you don't only want food and shelter, you also want a computer and a phone and a car; you want to be a functioning part of society that can participate in society at its specific level of development. The difference between bare survival and social reproduction is expressed in relative deprivation. In that regard, I doubt that any previously existing society has ever been ""post scarcity"" (I don't really like that term, but whatever) since relative deprivation has always existed.

> The kind of things that could and did significantly reduce food output in historical societies are not things that we have ""gotten over"" in modern society. Resource depletion and natural disasters, which have historically taken the 'post' out of post scarcity many a time, are still very much modern problems.

I'm not quite sure what you mean here. We produce food for 12 billion people, half of which we destroy on purpose in order to keep prices high.

> My biggest stumbling block for accepting communism is this requirement of a world that is truly post-scarcity - which does NOT just mean we are producing more than we need. It should mean that we can sustainably, reliably produce more than we need given any scenario that is likely to present itself. And it seems to me that getting to that world is far far FAR more important an objective than trying to convince people about what economic system we should have once we get there.

(On a side note, where does the 8 peers number come from, could this not be reduced to 6 or 4 to reduce requirements? What about blocks only mode or compact/thin blocks?) 

You've told me before that ""If you're not running a node, you're not really using Bitcoin."" - so by your logic; 100% of Bitcoin users are running full nodes :)

The point is, expecting large percentages of users to run a full node is unrealistic. Even if blocks were 100kb, the vast majority of users aren't going to be willing to download and run bitcoind, use any amount of storage, cpu and bandwidth when they can use a SPV-like client which uses less resources.

>Officer Tensing stated that he almost was run over by the driver of the Honda Accord and was forced to shoot the driver with his duty weapon (Sig Sauer P320).

Which is consistent with the video. The driver started the vehicle, and grabbed Tensing when he attempted to stop the vehicle form being put into gear, which would have resulted in Tensing being run over as the vehicle was put in motion.

>Officer Tensing stated that he fired a single shot. Officer Tensing repeated that he was being dragged by the vehicle and had to fire his weapon

Again. That is not what was stated in the post-shooting interview shown on the body camera footage. 

>So, I will ask again what was the reason for shooting at the suspect?

The suspect starting the car in preparation to flee. He grabbed the officer who reached into the vehicle to stop it from being put in gear, and completed putting the vehicle into gear, leaving the officer trapped against a vehicle that was in the process of being placed into motion. Even after being shot, the suspect managed to accelerate away and hold onto the police officer long enough to drag him enough to tear up his uniform and cause minor injury. There is every indication that he would otherwise have held on long enough to drag the officer to the point of major injury or death.

>I am familiar with Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor. While only time and the courts will truly decide, and with the evidence I have seen, I strongly feel that neither the Walter Scott case or the Samuel Dubose case reach the threshold for the use of deadly force.

Then you really aren't that familiar with either case law example.
From Tennessee v Garner Section IIB

>Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force. Thus, if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape

A suspect who has physically overpowered a police officer and disarmed him of a TASER has demonstrated that he poses a threat of serious harm, as does a suspect who has indicated a willingness to drag and/or run over a police officer attempting to permit his escape in that vehicle.

In Graham v. Conner the court held that:
>As in other Fourth Amendment contexts, however, the ""reasonableness"" inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one: the question is whether the officers' actions are ""objectively reasonable"" in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation. See Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 137 -139 (1978); see also Terry v. Ohio, supra, at 21 (in analyzing the reasonableness of a particular search or seizure, ""it is imperative that the facts be judged against an objective standard""). An officer's evil intentions will not make a Fourth Amendment violation out of an objectively reasonable use of force; nor will an officer's good intentions make an objectively unreasonable use of force constitutional. See Scott v. United States, supra, at 138, citing United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218 (1973). - See more at: http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/490/386.html#sthash.5BNFOFTQ.dpuf

In contrast you have attempted to judge uses of force based on what you believe to be the personality of the police officer involved (whether you have any evidence to support a personality judgement or not) regardless of the objective facts.

>Did you even read the article I linked to? It discussed a 2009 Tulsa County Sheriff's Department report given to NBC news.

Yes. I read it. As I said, they carefully word what they claim. They discuss ""A 2009 Tulsa County Sheriff's Department report"" without mentioning whether they are talking about findings of a formal investigation or any and all allegations made in a complaint to the department.

Let me give you an example of how that works: Someone with a mental illness reports police officers are flying around on magic carpets and peeping in people's windows. The police department taking the reports files it like any other report. A reporter who gets that report writes and article about how ""An internal report shows that police department x was made aware of officers conducting unauthorized surveillance"".

In this case there may be documentation of an actual investigation and formal statements, but the reporting is so vague that it is impossible to tell. 

>and officers are named who made the complaints

Read it again. It gave names that were listed in the referenced report. It does not state the people named where the ones who made those claims. Someone reported that some people complained about issues. Who was the person making the report, were formal statements taken, and have the people named confirmed making those statements?

>According to the Tulsa sheriffs department the report release was not authorized, but it did not deny the report was legitimate.

Again, are we talking about an investigative report, or a record of a reported complaint without the investigative findings attached? Both are ""a report"".

>So what do you think could be done to solve these problems?

Start with getting local governments to realize that the is no way to completely prevent lawsuits so long as some people have nothing to lose by filing a frivolous suit. Then, point out to them that the people who pay the taxes to support a state, county or city agency expect to to performs some actual function, not just attempt to avoid lawsuits. In the case of police that function has traditionally been arresting those who break laws. Next, get those same officials to admit that settling lawsuits because it is cheaper in the short run, regardless of the merit of the suit, actually costs more in the long run by encouraging more lawsuits.

The path to all of the above is faithfully vote out any official who fails to understand.

They were so good that I thought if they played like this in the World Cup, they could make the semifinals. Then a couple months later, they lost to North Korea and something seemed to change.

The 2011 friendly against South Korea was an incredibly special moment, as it was their first match against an international side not only since winning the Asian Cup, but also the March 11 earthquake.

I've watched just about all of Japan's games, including the loss against North Korea. That was a *very* weird game, having taken place in Pyongyang, and the team just wanted to get through the 90 minutes and get the fuck out. I don't blame them.

"> Yes, he saw himself in Gaara, so he wanted to save him. I get that. They're similar. Naruto and Sasuke are less similar however, and not only do they push the whole ""Naruto and Sasuke are similar, the most similar, look at how opposite and equal they are"" (which falls apart when they are more similar to other characters), they also attempt to state how they are best friends, which also falls apart, because their friendship was not developed. It's poor writing.

When did they push the whole ""Naruto and Sasuke are similar, the most similar""- when? Where? When? They pushed the fact they were complete opposites. I'll give evidence to support this fact: Naruto VS Sasuke not Naruto *&* Sasuke. Naruto is red, Sasuke is blue. Naruto represents light and unity. Sasuke represents darkness and loneliness. It was a yin/yang-type relationship... how you possibly misconstrued that as them being the most similar is beyond me. No one thought that... well, except you I guess? I asked you when and where they stated that they were the utmost two closest friends possible, but you didn't answer... so I'm going to presume you made that up. You also keep flipping on the term ""best"" friend which makes it hard to argue against since at any point in time you could just switch definitions, so I'll clarify this now: **I have several types of best friends, one of which I was born in the same room with, and a few of which I can talk with about anything without fear of judgement, one who lent me a helping hand- a person whom I very much respect** - As you can see... there is no definitive version of a best friend...

> Oh look, personal insults. Why do you feel the need to personally insult me? Insulting the other person in an argument does nothing to support your side, and only hurts it.
Also, I don't see how you strawmanning my argument helps you either. I never said they need to be best friends in every visual way. I'm saying they need to be shown to develop as friends, which they never were. There was one main mission they were on together, then the Chunin exams, and then Sasuke turned bad. There was very little development in their relationship.

It's not a strawman dude, that is your argument. You're saying that unless they didn't develop a special ""mysterious"" friendship (I say mysterious because you're not offering any sort of alternative, reasonable/suitable plot), Naruto's chase after Sasuke isn't warranted and their current friendship doesn't make sense to you. This episode was less about the uniqueness of their friendship and more about Sasuke's reasoning behind his actions, and his confusion as to why Naruto would go so far, and what it exactly means to be his friend. You keep suggesting that Neji is more alike Sasuke and Gaara is more alike Naruto therefore they should be better friends but in life that is not how friendships work. It is not a default or a given. All of their personalities are different. It wouldn't have made sense for anyone other than Naruto to have been able to reach Sasuke because like it was shown even early on, Naruto showed his weaknesses, so much so that it came off as loser-ish and goofy. Gaara didn't do that, he never would have. Neji didn't do that, he never would have either. Stop comparing them. It's literally irrelevant.

Oh shit, that one *translated* panel of which the context was Naruto desperately trying to win Sasuke back? You seriously think that Naruto doesn't consider each and every person his best friend in a different way? You're going to argue semantics and take it at its **literal** value? You really think Jiraiya, Gaara or Hinata aren't his best friends? Really? Really?

> I don't think I said Gaara should chase after Sasuke, I didn't even compare the two, I compared Gaara & Naruto and Sasuke & Neji. But, what plot holes? I mean, if Kishimoto decided to have Gaara and Sasuke share some connection and be friends for some reason, what plot holes would cause Gaara to not chase after him? Because the Akatski were after him? The Akatski were after Naruto too, yet he left the village traveling with Jiraya. If they really wanted Naruto, they could've sent more than 2 Akatski members, and he would be caught. Because he's Kazekage? Again, if Kishimoto wanted Gaara to chase after Sasuke, I doubt he would've made him Kazekage.

Then you're already changing the plot without adding alternative to the previous history we know of Gaara. That wouldn't make sense. He... shifts personalities and becomes Naruto 2.0 to get closer to Sasuke after being defeated by Naruto? Uhh... okay? At least provide a decent alternate summary of a story-line if you're going to complain about it.

> Regardless, I'm not saying Gaara or Neji should've chased after Sasuke, I'm saying both explanations they give for Naruto being close to Sasuke (being best friends and sharing pains) are poorly presented, making that plot have less emotional weight. It would hold more weight if they were actually developed as friends.

But it everything you're asking was literally asked by Sasuke in both the manga and anime. I don't get how you could be possibly confused after watching it. At their first battle at the Valley, Sasuke shows that he knows Naruto understands or thinks he understands a little of his pain, but as he literally says, Naruto had nothing to start with, and Sasuke lost everything. I would bet that a large majority of us still didn't realize the impact it has on someone's mental state to witness your brother kill every single member of your family/clan and to believe it with all your heart. And again, as it was stated, Naruto knows he can't understand all of it, but as he asked, does that mean he should just let him go? Let Sasuke destroy himself? No- as he revealed, he didn't want to because it hurts. Again, you keep talking about this mysterious development but it's not about that. It's about Sasuke's reasoning, and Naruto's personality. Yes, Neji went through a more similar experience of what Sasuke went through, but Neji is not Naruto, they are not the same person with the same personalities functioning with the same types of thoughts. They are different, most people are.

> I never said that ""IF naruto has the Kyuubi and can talk to Sasuke then Gaara can talk to Sasuke because he has the Sanbi"". Not once. I compared Gaara to Naruto, and Neji to Sasuke, but again, the point of that was not to say they should all be chasing each other around. I'm saying the explanation of ""Only they can reach out because Naruto understands Sasuke's pain and vice versa"" holds no weight when its blatantly false.

Who is ""only they"" and who made the statement that Naruto can only understand Sasuke's pain/vice versa? When?

> Again, I wasn't suggesting a proposition, merely pointing out bad writing. But you bring up a good point, personality. Both Gaara and Neji share a much more similar personality with Sasuke than Naruto. Gaara even points out how Sasuke shares the same look. And yes, compatibility. Naruto and Sasuke weren't shown to be compatible; in fact, they hated each other. Now, its okay to start out a relationship that way, but it wasn't properly developed from hate to friendship, even though that's what they said happened.

So if you can see that Neji, Gaara, and Sasuke are more similar, and Naruto is the odd one of the bunch, why can you not see the emphasis on Naruto's character and Sasuke's character? Why are you so obsessed with this mysterious bond? Is Sasuke's reasoning, poor and not understandable? Is Naruto's reasoning, poor and not understandable? I'm not understanding your perspective, at all. They were kids. Sasuke was never going to be that vulnerable or happy for a long time, presumably til he died. Sasuke had a change of heart in the moment he chose to save Naruto's life (although Haku never intended to kill them). That was a big indicator. Sasuke/Naruto go back to being pouting rivals, another indicator behind Sasuke's inability to let people in. Sasuke gets weak in the knees when he first meets Orochimaru- Naruto snaps him out of it, temporarily. Kakashi tries to help too. During the chuunin exam arc, you can still see some remote ""goodness"" in Sasuke. But in tangent with his new found power (cursed seal) and his jealousy/rivalry with Naruto + seeking to take revenge on his brother, he decided to take the path of ""darkness"" so to speak. If you want to make a modicum of sense to me, and have an issue with the plot, then start asking why Kishimoto chose to make Itachi reinforce the message, ""cling to hatred"" over and over. I mean, I get that he had to hide his true identity, but did he really have to push Sasuke into being obsessed with hatred that much? It would make sense if Itachi also despised what he did/the elders but they never expanded upon that.

Sorry I was unclear about this. You can immolate allies just the same as enemies during the 'Scalding Winds' effect. Immolation only grants the listed buffs, does not do anything detrimental. It lasts for two seconds, again, sorry. 

> Immolation I do not think it should apply UAM, Bonus damage, and bonus attack speed. Instead depending on base statistics.
These are all things that happen on attack and immolation is not attacking.

In my concept immolation is sort of 'attacking.' It does damage in intervals equal to how fast you would be attacking if you were attacking that target.   

Why do you feel that only base damage should be applied? Is it due to balance or consistency with other abilities?   

Edit: If immolation would deal damage purely based off of base damage, with no way of modifying interval speed, it would be identical to a damage over time that can be buffed by magic resistance modifiers since, as an intelligence based hero, there are few ways to greatly buff base damage. I want to keep the original idea concept, of this being similar to an auto attack. The struggle is with balancing that. I tried to balance it by putting on an 80% damage effectiveness modifier as well as turning it into composite damage. Tweaking those numbers is what I would prefer to do in terms of balancing.

"> Capitalism and so private property would be eliminated by the state during socialism.

Okay.  But you need to maintain a state on an ongoing basis in order to continue suppression of private property and private commerce.  Removing the artificial force that suppresses these things will inevitably result in their re-emergence.  

You're admitting that state socialism, as you call it, is a necessary precondition to what you're calling communism, but you're failing to articulate any method that could actually manage to transition from the former to the latter without the whole framework collapsing on itself.  This seems to square well with the observable fact that all attempts to actually achieve so-called communism have halted at and been maintained at state socialism prior to collapsing entirely.

> would have been illegal for decades if not more and it would not be possible to get people to work for you if they don't need to to live comfortably.

How can voluntary business arrangements be ""illegal"" in a system that doesn't have a state to enforce positive law.  As I asked above, if state socialism must actively suppress private commerce by making it ""illegal"", how can you remove that active suppression without restoring the status quo ante of people engaging in private commerce?

> it would be turned over to be organised and run by society for society and thus the criteria would be internally set. 

But the original status quo that the initial ""socialist"" program seeks to overturn *is* what was manifested by society itself without anyone attempting to impose a single, top-down plan on the whole of it.  Socialism *is* that top down plan, so again, why would things not revert back to their prior state rather than move into the next phase of that artificial plan once the artificial force is removed?

> As for creating a post scarcity society, we're already getting there.

As a result of technological improvements that are facilitated by open markets, and certainly not as a result of communist subversion of extant economic institutions.  The reductions in economic scarcity we see on the horizon are the result of the ""means of production"" being *more easily* developed and controlled by private parties, enabling people to own more private property to provide for their own needs.  This is the exact opposite of communism's goal of suppressing private property and subjecting all ""means of production"" to some vaguely-defined control by the ""community"" (which, by the way, I can't distinguish in operational terms from state control).

> Having corruption for a short while and achieving a incorruptible system

There is no such thing as an ""incorruptible system"" -- the idea that progressing through the (by your own admission) thoroughly corruptible system of state socialism can somehow alter the fundamental antecedents of human behavior such that the end result after removing that corrupt system will somehow be ""incorruptible"" is an irresolvable paradox.

"> Do you reckon there's anyway to help me lessen these feelings and just go to a platonic friendship without cutting contact?

You could draw up boundaries for yourself. Perhaps avoid talking about anything romantic. Maybe not talk about your lovelife with each other. You could also force yourself to see her as just a normal platonic friend through sheer will, and stop talking to her whenever you start to get feelings. I doubt any of those will work though, not over the long term. We're all human, and as human, we tend to erode such boundaries over time, sometimes without us even realizing it. So I suspect that your boundaries will eventually break down one day, and you'll start to push for more from her. Then one of two things will happen - you'll keep this inside you until it all comes exploding out with you confessing to her strongly, or, she'll find a new guy which will then cause you to be resentful and in pain. Both doesn't end well for you. Is there a chance she'll reciprocate? Perhaps, but I wouldn't count on it.

>I dont think religeous people are feeble minded, i think they are just naive and refuse to accept something that they dont want to.

It seems like you're being a little uncharitable in your estimation of a religious person's mental capacity here.  I might equally hear similar sentiments from a religious person about atheists and agnostics.  Is it really a surprise to you that people are often obstinate in their beliefs, especially long held ones?  Consider your belief in something like evolution (I'm assuming you believe that evolution is correct, but if I'm wrong, substitute some other basic belief you have about the world), you wouldn't easily be dissuaded from that view.  If evidence was suddenly dug up that appeared to show that evolution was totally flawed, you wouldn't be quick to accept it.  You might consider other possibilities, that it was a hoax, that the more evidence will be forthcoming which will explain the apparent discrepancy, that human error played a role and so on.  Is it therefore that surprising to you that anyone who fervently believes in almost anything is often very reluctant to change that belief, be it religious or otherwise.  

As for naivety, that seems a little harsh.  Many of the finest minds of modern history have also believed in God and religion to varying extents.  This includes, but certainly isn't limited to Albert Einstein, Gandhi, John Locke, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Leo Tolstoy, and C. S. Lewis.  In our own day there is no shortage of religious people who are known for the intellectual rigor of their professions, be they doctors, physicists, authors or philosophers.  Surely you cannot believe that all of these people believe in such things out of naivety and stubborness?

>Honestly i havn't properly investigated why.

Well I think you probably should if you think that this phenomenon is holding back the human species, don't you?  Let's start with this discussion, but I strongly advise that you seek out other thoughts apart from my own on the matter.

>But i think it would have something to do with the feeling of safety. 

Well since you've never investigated it, again it seems like you're being fairly uncharitable in your assessment of the motives behind such beliefs.  Can you think of any of your own beliefs which you hold simply because they make you feel safer, or perhaps happier, or because they're convenient?  Think of an idea which is comforting to you, for example, ""that at the moment of death, you feel nothing but pleasure"".  That sounds nice, it certainly removes some of the fear and trauma of death.  Why not just believe it now, since it makes you feel better?  I'm willing to wager that you cannot conjure forth a strong conviction that my example is true, even if you wanted to, because it would be absurd to believe in something purely for convenience or comfort.  Now, perhaps all religious people are simply prone to making this absurd leap of logic, but considering the names above, some of whom spent lifetimes questioning and investigating our universe, this seems a little unfair.

The reality is that religious beliefs are not a simplistic matter; on the contrary, they are often profoundly complex and difficult to articulate.  I personally have never heard a religious person ever explain their beliefs with your explanation.  If you take the time to speak with them in a calm, and open fashion, I think you'll be surprised to discover that many religious people have thought long and hard about the exact same things as you have, but have drawn radically different conclusions from those things.  

I've also met a few who felt similarly that atheists' beliefs were based purely in cynicism, spite and a lack of imagination.  A similarly unfair account of why areligious people believe the things they do, and often justified by recounting tales of atheists going out of their way to be hurtful and insulting.  Such folks were often disinclined to listen to any arguments by their opponents because they had already diagnosed the basis of their beliefs as being malicious instead of genuine.  

When atheists believe that theists are naive and stubbornly clinging to a crutch and theists believe that atheists are simply angry, hurtful and closed minded, I think we can both imagine what happens when they meet: they fulfill all of their expectations of one another and come away with a deeper sense of their own righteousness and the opponent's folly, and incidentally a reduced likelihood of ever seeking out an honest and open dialogue with a member of the other group in the future.

I'm glad to see that you're actively trying to avoid this cycle, and applaud your willingness to see this as an opportunity.

>Believe it or not, i dont really know any hardcore fundies.  But, as much as i'd like to have one, i've never had a proper discussion with a religeous person, and i would like to hear there side of the arguement not on the internet.

Well I would definitely not recommend seeking out 'hardcore fundies', unless you want a healthy dose of frustration.  That said, if you live in America, finding Christians (or Jews, or Muslims, or members of the hundreds of other religions out there) shouldn't be too hard.  What's difficult is finding people who share you willingness to have a discussion and a context where you can engage one another without things getting heated.  I'd venture that there's probably a subreddit dedicated to various church groups in your area, find one that seems reasonable and just go there and ask some folks.  People tend to be pretty happy to tell you about their beliefs regardless of what they are as long as you're prepared to listen respectfully.

Who is getting mutilated? you can't just walk into a hospital and get a sex change surgery in Canada. Many provinces have long wait lists for the surgery and requirements that the person must pass first. Often they are required to live as the other gender for a set number of years, be with a psychologist trained in these areas, be passed by a psychologist (there is only one in alberta who does this as of last year), and a bunch of other things. These things are not done to young children or teenagers. Current practice is advising a delay of puberty and then allowing for hormone replacement therapy to develop the person's body in the gender they wish. Waiting until after puberty has been correlated with higher dysphoria. 

Not to mention the current psychological trauma that other children have received by being forced into a gender identity that they do not believe they have. If your child is more happy as a girl or as a boy, then they are more likely to be well adjusted adults.

Don't confuse these two cases.  They are radically different.

This is what makes those 2.25 seconds problematic - they would seem to dictate that there were **no** significant opposing forces (not just reduced forces) being exerted by *any* structural supporting members during those 2.25 seconds, equal to 8 stories of collapse. **No** amount of existing structure can equal the **resistance of AIR**.

No, it's like saying he definitely did, but he did so because it was demanded by the opposition party that held the balance of power in a minority legislature. In case you've forgotten, the NDP demanded that spending to support the budget, while the Liberals agreed with the spending but vowed to vote against the budget either way.

Criticisms of Harper for the pre-crisis deficit are valid if you're a very strong deficit hawk. But the majority of people here are center-left voters, and their representatives either outright demanded or at least implicitly agreed with the deficits.

I am a little bit astounded by how willing progressive voters are to be hypocritical in criticizing Harper on this point. I get that a lot of people are deeply opposed to Harper, but that doesn't justify objective hypocrisy, just like the fact that supporting Harper doesn't justify his various hypocrisies.

Also:

>This was after the economic crash that was triggered by neoconservative economics that Harper jerks off too.

As the other guy notes, the mortgage market and subsequent securitization problems are not well-defined as caused by any one strand of economic thought.

The other way around is different, I think. You've *probably* dragged your thinking-of-itself-as-unattractive self along with you into your good-looking era, and that remnant is ""creepy"" (or ""closed"" or whatever) and still prominent. I'm guessing. Here's what I know:

Until I was about thirty, I was at the bottom of movie-star-hot range. Not Pitt/Clooney hot, but ""this guy is Somebody and I really hope he likes me"" hot. There was no sight-orgasming and not much sex-begging, but most interactions I had with women were *premised* on their first impression of me, which was usually some variation of ""I would *so* fuck that guy."" And starting there, *all* their presumption was in my favor.

My ""personality"" at the time was a work-obsessed nerd's, but they didn't care or didn't see it—and I didn't care because it didn't matter, at least not the *first few times* it showed its repellent self. I had to *convince them* to GTFO. Not that I tried to. All the same rejections any obsessively not-there dork gets *happened*. I just got laid (or whatever else I wanted) first, because I was hot.

Now it's different. I've fallen down the scale to above-average, distinguished-professor level. I don't have the right face to go Connery and get sexier. And now women's (except old women's, who think I'm ""handsome"") first-impression presumptions are almost all *against me*, just like they are for about 90% of guys.

I don't know how the average dude can stand it. Women *hate* the average dude, and they're *mean as hell* about it. And I've had a really hard time adjusting to that. I don't act much differently than I did when I was hot, and the same attitudes and behavior (a.k.a. ""personality"") delivered via my present physical self are received *completely* differently.

The difference in how women treat men based on immediate attractiveness is shocking. I don't think many men get to see it, except by inference, when their wives leave them for the sexy pool boy or something. The bubble is real.

">Because when you talk about world rankings you don't exclude arbitrarily. And we can't compare ourselves to other countries that have the strictest gun laws in the world.

I don't understand this argument. Are you saying that the US is doing a good job of controlling (gun) homicide levels, because they're doing better than countries that have no money, poorly structured government, and low quality of life? For the most part, it seems like the majority of Americans disagree with that sentiment.

>Switzerland is 4th in guns per capita at less that half of the US. And they are very different as you mentioned and just in terms of culture in general.

Perhaps the *culture* is at fault then. Slavery used to be a part of the American culture, but that didn't stop people from striving to change it when they realized how awful it was.

>Anyone can drive a car, a license is not required to drive unless you want to drive on public roads. And even so far more people are killed by cars than guns every year as well.

There's actually a use to automobiles besides killing people. On top of that, they're used way more than firearms. Not to mention that people *actively try to regulate and improve road safety.* However, whenever gun control is brought up, the 2nd Amendment is thrown up as a shield.

 >So you think in the US if something like that happened no ex military would be involved? You have no idea what the culture here is like. Some of the biggest proponents of this are ex military. And it's not who controls the military, it's who the military sides with. The government should always control them, but sometimes after the rebellion starts they change sides.

I think we're just arguing semantics about the military here - the bottom line is that whichever side has the largest military presence in a rebellion is usually the side that wins. I don't think that an armed population would do much except inflate the death toll.

Acting like one doesn't either.

Now with your rephrasing here, you hit high and low points.

You are probably correct about his ""tiredness."" However, where you're inaccurate is your assertion that low t is a fad diagnosis. With the way US medicine (and frankly, if you're not in the US, I don't care.) and insurance goes, Low T is a diagnosis of almost last resort. In general you have to be sub clinic range for insurance to even accept the diagnosis and pay on treatment.

You may be confused about the boutique doctors offering anti-aging who will put anyone on 100mg of test-c weekly as long as their money is green, and that would be a mistake on your part. They don't make enough of the provider market to create any sort of fad, and we're being intellectually dishonest if we believe standard of care is same across the board regardless of income level.

Finally, there's enough current research showing that low t is in fact an issue, and either you're not up on research, which is not uncommon, or you think the research to date is completely wrong. Which would then lead me to asking you about your stance on the theory of evolution, and climate change.

However, none of that matters. Doctors who dismiss actual clinical issues a ""fad diagnoses"" are a pox upon the profession, and really not paying attention to their promises. Namely:
1. Respecting hard won scientific gains from your predecessors.
2. There is art to medicine as well as science, and that you will have understanding.
3. Remember that you treat a sick human being, not a chart, not a flawed understanding of research, not your own beliefs on fads, but someone who has a life, and just wants to live the damn thing.
4. Remember that you have been conferred a certain level of privilege by society, and you won't defecate all over that with your dismissal of things as fads, when their is a legitimate issue.

Particularly with a fucking teen so far out of the mean for his age group it isn't even funny. 

Finally, low total testosterone is evidence of hypogonadism, and should get follow up treatment by a PCP, and then managed by an endo.

>Do you have a vested personal interest in Gender being a complete social construct? 

If you read carefully, you'll note that I never said gender was a complete social construct. 

I do have a vested personal interest in people not making too much of brain sex because 1) that would lead you to false conclusions and 2) brain sex differences are usually amplified and used for sexist purposes. 

>But when it comes to gender identity, and why we are who we identify as, there ARE physiological reasons for it(there is a physiological reason for everything that a human does or thinks, we are just a big chemical reaction after all), and the brain IS physically dimorphic. 

I'm not opposed to the idea that there are physiological reasons for being transgendered, but the connection may not take the forms you are assuming, nor is there conclusive evidence in ANY direction. There has only been interesting findings, some of which do not at all support the idea that gender identity is linked to brain sex. I would like to pair those interesting findings with a strong note of caution not to rely too much on ideas about physical dimorphism and *particularly* how that dimorphism might be essentialist/innate in relation to psychology. 

A cursory look into the problem of consciousness suggests that thinking of us as ""a big chemical reaction"" is not accurate mental modeling.

I'm not trying to attack you, those are sympathetic questions. it's not something to fear. Men and Women DO think differently, and it;s a wonderful thing, it's also not exclusionary.

No. I know that males and females have *tendencies* toward different brains. I am who I am -- I know that I'm a genderfluid individual born female, I know that I'm capable and intelligent and strong. 

But do you know how often I've heard that ""~celebrate difference~"" line of thinking in the service of utterly insidious sexism? The idea may have some abstract value, but I'll admit it holds absolutely no sway over me. *I have seen erroneous ideas about brain sex difference used over and over again in the service of sexism*. I have a robust sense of caution about them, and so should you. They are only going to backfire on trans people. 

To turn the question back: does your identity as an MtF rely on these ideas about brain sex?

"> The ""libertarians, voluntaryists, anarchists"" that I know are some of the most empathetic, caring, and charitable people I know.

First off, I'm not talking about voluntaryism or anarchism. Perhaps not even about the libertarians you refer to, considering it's not a black and white picture (especially self-proclaimed left-wing libertarians are really just progressives with extremely misguided economic ideals).

I'm talking about *mainstream US libertarianism*, of which I think Ron Paul, the person in question here in this topic, is quite a good example. And I find the people who support Ron Paul's viewpoints to be quite far removed from the concept of empathy.

Ron Paul has spoken about removing birthright citizenship, tried to curtail people's rights with his We The People Act (which would effectively have invalidated important legislative victories like Roe v. Wade and Lawrence v. Texas by preventing state courts from using them as precedent), voted against *not supporting genocide* (being the only one to do so), has tried to weaken the Civil Rights Act (his son even went on air saying he's against the section making it illegal for businesses to discriminate on basis of race—the single most important part of the Act which *ended legal racism*), and has basically done very little other than trying to tear down some of the most important social and economic developments of the past century on the basis that they are shackles around our feet.

On his presidential campaign website, he advocated abolishing the Department of Education, the FDA, the EPA, and a ton of other agencies that provide vital public services. And the worst part? *All of this is perfectly consistent with mainstream US libertarian viewpoints.*

Although I applaud him whenever he does something good, like opposing war or military spending, he's really the polar opposite of what you would call empathetic if you look at the legislation he's sponsored over the years."

>So you're telling me the only way for an Engi with a lvl 3 to be effective is if half the team is watching him? That's precisely why every decent engi will just run minis.

Half the team?  One pyro (admittedly not the best choice as he'd be better airblasting back the uber) OR one soldier (used this tactic a few times in hl matches and works pretty well - not like solly has much else to do other than spam/bomb).

>I'm telling you as someone who plays engi a shit load. Given the choice between a level 3 sentry with no wrangler and a mini, I will take a mini 90% of the time.

I only have around 200 hours engy, though I have played a lot of HL as other classes.  With a coordinated push, a sentry is a target that will be taken down quickly - wrangled or not.  It's a distraction to waste valuable seconds of the attacking uber on.  A mini sentry will die quickly and the uber target doesn't really need to pay attention to it - they can focus on triggering the opposing uber whilst other classes can take down the at best 3 mini sentries you could lay down."

The point is, mech obviously doesn't work because one unit, the immortal, counters every factory unit, even if a factory unit was added that countered the immortal, it needs to be _hard countered_ by stalkers in some way so there's a reason to make stalkers which gives a reason to make tanks.

I think you're confusing power with torque. A Honda S2000 engine will rev limit at around 9000 rpm (which is about as high as it gets in street cars) and develops peak power at 8300 rpm. But you can't even compare that 2.0L N/A four-banger to a 28L supercharged late 1930s V12 design. A big V12 runs much smoother and doesn't even rev anywhere close that high (less friction, less mechanical vibrations and it doesn't have to deal with intake air resonance thanks to forced induction) so peak power will probably increase steadily along with increasing rpm until the propeller tips reach trans-sonic speeds.

> roughly 90% throttle the P-38 has more power than it does at 100% and even WEP which doesn't make sense in a game where 100% means most power, not 100% rpm

You said it yourself - throttle. It's a throttle handle, not an rpm adjustment. And you are right, having more power at 90% throttle than with a fully opened throttle (100%) doesn't make sense. Not in game and not in reality."

">""Samsung Apps"" (which I've never used)

It is hilarious that you mention Samsung Apps, as I did that this morning, I froze it, and then apparently that ""app"" was the entire menu system and I couldn't do anything other than access the dialing menu, so I restarted the system, and it hung on the SAMSUNG logo. I thought i'd bricked my phone. I tried a couple things like remoting into it and using that Odin tool to fix it, but neither of those worked so I had to boot into recovery mode and reset the entire phone, which worked.

I think had I *deleted* the app rather than simply *frozen* it, I would have been screwed wouldn't have I? Because resetting the phone just (i'm guessing) just resets all apps and settings to factory defaults, but had I deleted the app entirely, it wouldn't have been able to restore it, wheras resetting my settings simply removed Titanium Backup and thus allowed the app to be ""unfrozen"". (What is the point in actually backing up apps anyway because I don't really see it, is it just if you delete rather than freeze it so you can get it back later? Why would I ever want to delete something rather than freeze it, what does that give me that freezing does not?)

I also went and paid for Titanium Backup because it seemed like such a great little tool and was cheap..(I think I couldn't freeze anything unless I had ""donated"" anyway?) it's far too easy to spend money on apps when you're an impulse buyer.

Anyway, I **was** planning on resetting the whole thing anyway when my 32gb card arrives tommorow and setting it up properly nice and neat (OCD) after figuring out how everything worked, so it turned out not so bad."

People may very well be willing to use SJW/Full SJW too often, but the solution isn't to use the words less often. It's to understand ""why"" and when to use the terms, not to simply stop using them.  
  
This is something the OP doesn't understand and why their argument comes off as tone policing/concern trolling.  
  
IE: What Robert said, was in fact in line with how SJWs act/speak. Thus saying he went ""Full SJW"" is a valid use of the term.  
  
Yet according to the OP, I should be labeled as someone that went ""Full Retard"" for using the term ""Full SJW"".  
  
As for overusing ""SJW"" like Feminists overuse Sexism, think about it this way.  
  
Lets say, you're at college and notice that people are becoming more and more indoctrinated everyday. To the point that in one of your classes, the students (both male and female) are being openly sexist in their statements towards men (like saying ""it's ok if we oppress men, because they've oppressed women since the dawn of time"").  
  
Just because you can apply the label of ""sexist"" to so many students and their words/actions, doesn't mean ""sexist"" has lost it's meaning or that you should use it less often.  
  
Understanding the terms is key, usage is another issue all together.  
  
Keep in mind, most people have varying definitions of SJW, thus usage of the term is on a subjective basis.  
  
Thus if the OP really wanted to attempt to reduce its usage, they wouldn't simply say ""use it less"". They would need to offer up a definition to be ""set in stone"" here on KIA (and possibly other places).. one that everyone uses, so you can simply say ""hey, you're using that word wrong!"".  "

One of the really screwed up things about the way the system works is that the teams that have ODI status at this level can also lose it at the drop of a hat.

PNG earned ODI status a couple of years ago. They then played a two match ODI series against Honk Kong (PNG won 2-0). Since then they have played 50 over games against a number of Associates, but on the day PNG played them, the other team didn't have ODI status.

A Muai Thai practitioner doesn't need to meditate or perform special breathing techniques to execute a perfect leg kick. It takes years of training and muscle memory.

If you personally believe their is an internal energy, chi or spirit that enables someone to perform said techniques, that is your own belief. But let's make sure you understand, it's a belief. It cannot be proven. Someone going to the gym everyday and practicing a spinning heel kick every day for 5 years until he/she perfects it, can be proven. So don't go throwing around percentages when what you are talking about isn't based on science.

">Maybe her ratios are a little off and she needs some tuning down. Maybe they're just fine. What most people can agree on though is that she feels better to play and isn't as uni-directional as before.

I think this is the important thing.  Whenever there's a rework people focus mostly on whether they think the new rework is balanced or not (they rarely do), but the entirely point of reworks is for fixing champs whose problem goes beyond balance.  Everyone who's tried her seems to agree that she's way more fun to play.  Her spears are still satisfying, but now she's a very dynamic champion with motivation to all-in after landing a spear and Cougar form controls much better, as opposed to being a clunky extremely mobile spear machine.

If her damage is too high, they can always lower it.  The important thing is that they've changed her play pattern so that she's actually encouraged to interact with enemy champions and combo her abilities together instead of sitting at 1500 chucking spears all day."
">So Robin in How I Met Your Mother is accurately depicted as far as that goes?

It's not totally unrealistic. Read through the biographies of the on-air talent local stations post on their Websites. You see the career trajectories people take, from producer (off-camera employee that creates/writes the on-air segments you see reporters do) in Syracuse to reporter/weekend anchor in Des Moines to reporter in Sacramento to anchor in Mobile to reporter/weekend anchor in Seattle to weekend anchor in LA to anchor in Chicago.

In Robin's case, she began as a reporter in Saskatchewan before moving to Metro News One (i.e., NY1), where she became a substitute weekend anchor and, later, full-time anchor. Although in a big market NY1 is at the bottom of the barrel, equivalent to Syracuse or Sacramento. She then moved to a bizarre English network in Tokyo; this is the one unrealistic part of her career track. She then returned to NYC and Barney helped her get a job as anchor for a very early-morning local news show. She was then offered a better anchor job in Chicago, turned it down for her boyfriend Don (who took the job instead), and joined a cable news network as a producer although she has since done some on-camera work. While on-air talent moving off camera while still young (and, especially important for women, attractive) is unusual, her having only done Metro News One and the similarly little-watched morning news show make it not improbable."

"> You mean a bunch of individuals that represents most interest groups and unions in Hong Kong? Why, that's better than what we had under the British. And we'll have pseudo-elections coming on top of that on schedule, so people can experience democracy for what it really is: whoever spends the most money on advertising wins.

How is a dishwasher's interest represented in this current system? or a student's? Would one-man-one-vote at least be a slight improvement to this?

Many member of the functional constituencies had voted down public investigations into the rejection of HKTV licence and the boondoggle that is the High Speed Railway. 

Particularly in the HKTV case, the majority of directly-elected legislators wanted the investigation but the majority of the functional constituencies said no.

In the British Parliament, if the House of Lord blocks something, at least the House of Common can pass it again and the House of Lord can't block it the second time. There are similar rules between US Senate and Congress.

Even if you put aside your misgiving of democracy in general, don't you as a single citizen still wish to have a legislature that can look into these things? The functional constituencies are accountable to only a small group of people and that's why they get away with shit like not investigating in things that are actually of public interest regardless of political leaning. I'm sure there are DAB voters out there who want to watch HKTV too. If you pay taxes, why aren't you outrage with the way money is being squandered over the High Speed Railway?

Or maybe you think finding the truth is a waste of money? Or maybe you don't care about things like the truth?

>The ""inconvenience"" is something we have to live with since you agree as much that OVERALL Hong Kong benefits far more from mainland tourists than without. You can't both have the cake and eat it. 

My original point was the inconvenience is costing people time, money - we might as well throw in quality of life, I think people have the right to expect a residential neighbour to stay largely residential - how are we compensating them for those losses? The distribution of the benefit is UNEVEN, fuck overall, that's why people are upset. The government should be there to balance the interest of people who making money from the tourists and those who don't and those you're directly affected by it, i.e. enforcing strict zoning rules, parking rules, crack down on parallel importers, whatever. 

But they don't.

>But that's not saying we cannot adapt and MINIMIZE this inconvenience as Singapore proved (focus on high-yield mainland tourists who also happens to be those who don't go around shitting in streets).

I don't see you holding our government accountable to that. 

Aside from a few government official lamely gesturing they might do something after the last blowup, the only party that is currently proposing a border tax to stop the flood of parallel importers and focus on the high-yield tourist is People Power - yup, the bunch of extremists you don't like. 

A tax is fairer than a quota if you ask me. Pity I don't see any better proposals from the business minds like the Liberal Party or Regina.

>You also don't see Singaporeans complaining because they're not whining bitches and they actually deal with their problems by adapting to them instead of attacking tourists. You know, like how we USED to do.

I don't like the attack on the tourists either, but I blame the government more for letting the situation fester for this many years. The first anti-locust rally is at least 3, 4 years ago in Sheung Shui, there was plenty of time to for them to research, respond and adapt, yet they did nothing.

If we're talking about Singapore anyway. At least, they have good public housing system. People don't have to live in subdivided housing while mainland investors leave their investment properties empty for years. Furthermore, the Singapore government loves to bribe people with their housing and certainly won't be devoting ONLY 6% of the land to public housing in what would be their biggest development project for the next 20 years like the HKSAR gov't is currently proposing.

>I DO prefer the mom-and-pop stores in residential malls over outlets, but I'm not going to go around attacking mainland tourists over it. That's something you support when you defend Long Hair and pan-dem extremists like him.

There is no avenue in the current government system to enforce this preference. The government is doing a shit job even enforcing rules that would help save mom-and-pop store in properties that they OWN, thanks to 領滙 and the free-market idiots crafting these policies.

> You have three examples from history and none are more recent than 4 centuries ago. Witch hunts pre-date organized religion and seem more rooted in popular folklore. This is not a stellar case against religion.

Completely incorrect. These were very real, very well documented instances of religiously motivated killings. Millions upom millions were killed, tortured, exiled and more. This is not folklore by any means. Partially why the america's were colonized were to escape Religious persecution.

The number of terrorists to religious adherents is about 20,000,000 to 1. If religion is such a dangerous idea, why are so few murderous extremists? 

I wouldn't say there are few religious extremeists. Anyone who uses their religion to persecute another is an extremist. Majority of the south of the states is still using religion to justify hate, murder, discrimination against all sorts of classes, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and more. Let alone what's happening in the middle east and Africa, and Russia. They may not all be murderous, but there are more examples of death's due to religion than not.

Education in religion is MUCH different than education in society. I agree there are some religions that take it seriously, but again, I bring up the point of creationism, scientific research, and climate change. As they alter known facts with bible malarchy... You cannot dispute fact with faith, the combination leads to a watering down of the TRUE FACTS. Again, dumbing down society.

The fact that they can still fire people for simply being gay doesn't bother you? or how about the fact that the Vatican spent billions of dollars and years covering up pedophiles within their organization? or how about that your bible advocates for slavery, racism, death for adultry, not allowing women to have a voice, and much more.

I'm a firm believer that if you read the bible cover to cover you'd get a better idea of how fucked up it really is. Incest, rape, murder, racism, slavery, and more that people take as literal.

Pretty sure it was written by man, altered, mis-translated, and even voted on by MEN to see which verses went in, and which they left out...

"You sounded like a employee trying to jerry rig an illicit access point for your buddies to be honest. Your second crack at explaining your topology is much more like a tech. Thanks. Sorry didn't mean to poke fun at you so bad!

The basic answer to your question: lies in whether or not DHCP is a feature set of a ""Cisco Small Business router"", is it like, an 851?

If it is, you're asking for help setting up manual DHCP, configuring on the Cisco IOS command line, or Security Device Manager tool?

Have you considered putting the old consumer grade back on until you have a solid proof-of-concept simulation of your network with the new hardware, then implement it out of office hours?

I would get yourself a computer illustrated network topology drawn out, both physical and logical, and try and restructure from there. Sounds like the last tech didn't bother so now you're in the shit?

Let me confirm your points back to you...

>Our ISP assigns a static address for internet access

You have one public IP address assigned to you by the ISP? No internet facing webservers or anything? This uses PAT to allow your local hosts to all share this public IP address out on the web.

>Every Computer connects to the network by assigning an IP between .1 and .255 (of course)

You previously had a default class C private local LAN. (ooh, let me remind you here .255 is not a valid IP address, just like .0 is reserved too, but you knew that right?)

>When I started here, they had a meant for consumer d link router, needless to say, I took this off of the network. I replaced it with a Cisco Small Business router and I currently use it as an access point.

Im guessing its something like the 851, like a *Small Office Home Office (SOHO) grade ISR wireless router, but with the benefits of IOS, telnet etc. The d-link should still allow decent security, whats the previous setup? Was it open or secured with WPA2 or something?

>They are upset because now when you login to the wireless you have to assign an ip in order to gain access. This makes them unhappy because they liked how easy it was to hook up their phones and laptops to the company network /facepalm.

The facepalm makes me guess it was unsecured? 
But anyway, when a mobile handset tries to connect to the AP/ISR(?) they get no DHCP service and have to give their hansdets a guessed IP in the .1 to .254 range? That is very bad because you will get a heap of IP conflicts on your network.

If it's any consolation (ha!), this will change in the next ~2 years as consoles stratify (PS4 vs. PS4 Pro, Xbox One vs. Scorpio).  Games will need to run on the base console as well as the more powerful one, which means more PC-like development will be needed.  It's also pretty obvious that Microsoft's Xbox Play Anywhere program is about pushing this kind of configuration down to consoles, because ultimately the goal will be to have all Xbox games built using UWP and ship the exact same binary on console and PC.

"> Incorrect. Lessig himself agrees a crime was probably committed. Lessig's position is that it shouldn't even be defined a crime, or at least, it should not be considered a felony. Here are Lessig's words:

I think there's a case to be made that Swartz did something wrong, but a federal felony? Hacking?

> Wrong. First, for purposes of legal adjudication, the case law clearly establishes that IP is property. Second, the fact that people are willing to pay for JSTOR access is proof positive that it is a sort of valuable property.

I pay someone to clean my house. Is that cleaning property? JSTOR is a service, a service Swartz had lawful access to. Transfer of money is not evidence of the existence of property. And if Aaron Swartz ""stole"" copyrighted material, he should have been charged with civil copyright infringement.

> Actually, Professor Kerr has been one of the leading voices on reclassifying minor violations of the CFAA as misdemeanors, a position that is quite similar with Professor Lessig's.

Fair enough. I did finish reading his opinion.

Let's agree on what Swartz did. He spoofed his MAC address to overcome a ""soft limit"" JSTOR and MIT put on downloads. Now, Kerr seems to argue that this constitutes unauthorized access, and perhaps given the vague reading of that, it might.

But what if Swartz had simply used another laptop instead of changing the MAC address of his existing one? If he used a second laptop to gain access, would that have been ""hacking""?

To give another example, many coffeeshops impose time limits on wifi access, and those limits are enforced by MAC address. It's also common for college students to simply change their MAC addresses to overcome those limits. Now, I'd agree that's probably wrong on some level, but is it a federal felony? It certainly shouldn't be, and that's the point."

"If you think it is in any way easy to know (much less supply) the right help for someone with a form of schizophrenia then you are woefully uninformed about schizophrenia.  And should probably be grateful for that fact.

Granted, I also think the premise of this is more or less some self-pitying bullshit, but I can understand how it feels.  Many people have been brutally depressed, be it for a few months or for years and year.  The specifics may be different, but you'd be surprised how similar it is from person to person.

I know that the suggestion to just force yourself to find something you can enjoy in life seems hopelessly vague, but almost anyone who has had a non-losing struggle with serious depression will more or less say the same thing.  If there was an explicit 10 step process to not being depressed, no one would be depressed.  The feeling is very similar person to person, but what ends up justifying living each day is absolutely unique.

>You wouldn't tell a schizophrenic person to just stop being paranoid, but people often will tell a depressed person to just be happy or stop having bad thoughts.

Yes, you absolutely should.  And if you ever have a friend who is schizophrenic, for the love of god, please tell them if/when they're being crazy or paranoid.  I think you understand schizophrenia even less than you think the non-depressed understand depression.

As to the second part of that, depression takes different forms, but almost universally, depressed people have a tendency to get upset about things and really wallow in it until it has been blown completely out of proportion.  I don't say that in a judgemental way, it's simply the case: it's why bright, beautiful, intelligent people leave suicide letters about how dumb, ugly, and worthless they are.  I found it immensely helpful when people were able to let me know if I was getting more negative about something than was really going to do any good.  And I know for a fact that I wasn't alone in finding that sort of feedback useful.

> It doesn't make sense to me.

Since most people see someone looking kinda down and assume they're just having a bad day/stressful week and because most depressed people really suck at communicating to those around them that they're depressed and not just having a bad day/week, it's a not entirely unreasonable thing to say.  And it isn't about the words, give people more credit than that: they're just trying to be supportive without being nosy.  Appreciate their good will and not how completely wrong they seem to you.

What those words mean in a more abstract sense is actually especially valuable insight.  Due to spending several of my teenage years locked up/lacking my freedom, I've known a fuck of a lot of depressed people.  Almost everyone who I have seen/known who has found a fulfilling way of living with it would say it more or less came down to a somewhat nebulous but far reaching decision one day to just live differently.  Most people (particularly depressed people though) have something of a crisis in their early 20s.  Usually the full shittiness of the world is sinking in and the question of ""is this world something I want to experience for another five decades"" takes considerable prominence.  Obviously some decide it isn't worth it.  Those who decide that life is worth experiencing  (unpleasant and grating as it almost always is) simply find something they can enjoy in life.  And then orient their lives around the things they find rewarding.  But it also requires giving life a (nother) chance, which when you're depressed, requires a genuine leap of faith.

From the people I've seen who have learned to live with depression in an ultimately pleasant way all seem to have at some point accepted that while their mind is healthy and sane, their brain is slightly (in the big scheme of things) imbalanced.  Remember, the brain essentially acts as an intermediary/filter of your ways of sensing the world around you.  It's like a lens on a camera: if it gets dirty, the image will show the dirt. If you're a pretty depressed person, your brain is going to be very quick to provide you with any number of negative or hopeless interpretations of what you see.  But just because you have a negative thought, it doesn't mean you have to act off it.  Hell, negative thoughts are a universal part of life and they're even a healthy response to negative, shitty things.  When people tell you to 'be happy' or to 'stop having bad thoughts' they are knowingly or unknowingly (and it doesn't really matter) giving you the key to the entire equation: you have to know which things are worth feeling shitty about and which things aren't.  As a depressed person, it's particularly hard to tell because your brain is going to jump to the shitty conclusion almost automatically, on a bad day, you can pretty much count on that.

Of course this is all predicated on someone not wanting to feel like shit.  I mean, that's the crisis in the 20s that I'm talking about: people end up asking ""is life worth living like this?"" Which usually leads to ""fuck no it isn't, this sucks.""  Thankfully, most people hit a ""have I really, honestly tried everything?"" point at which most can't convince themselves.  Of course that whole thing usually brews for months or years because a life and past and present and future really is a lot to give up on a dubious idea that life will never offer anything worthwhile.  There are billions of 2 legged examples who find something worthwhile in life.  Eventually something happens that makes life just too shitty to keep going and the only two choices become giving up or changing something.  No one change will fix everything and there is absolutely no miracle cure or short cut.  But if you try different things, you'll find things that make life a little more bearable and a little less unpleasant.  Find enough and you might tip the scales the other way.  Odds are you'll always have that inclination to depressed thinking, but over time it will become less all-encompassing and will start to seem less situationally valid.  

Depression really is a choice, but that's a terrible way of saying it.  It's more like a series of thousands and thousands of choices that will eventually pay off.  But they're all choices that only you can make, others can only encourage them and support them. I was similarly frustrated at the inability of the world to help, but I remember thinking one day that if I had  a depressed kid, what would I do?  And I realized that I had no fucking clue how I would support a depressed kid or what might help, even as someone profoundly familiar with what it's like. Now I'd answer that I'd help them find a few things they enjoy because those will be the only things that will ever make life feel worthwhile.

I didn't mean for this to turn out so long, but you touched a nerve that particularly takes me back to more than a decade ago.  Obviously I can relate to how you feel, though I know my experiences before and after are obviously entirely different.  So you know, this almost ended up more as what I wish I could have been told back when I felt as you do.  It would have saved me many years of misery."

>   Why is it constructive to mock and insult people from afar rather than try to explain things?

SRS' mission isn't to improve reddit.  

It's not meant to be constructive, it's meant to be cathartic. 

And mocking on one sub is not mutually exclusive from also trying to explain your point of view calmly to people on other subs.  Admittedly, some people do stop doing that because it seems like a waste of time.  It usually just ends up in two or more people talking past each other.  

In the end, unless they were already ambivalent, it doesn't change anyone's mind much either way.  When it comes to shit like transphobia, and seeing people persist with their stupidity even after being calmly explained to, I've come to the realisation that given that I'm no genius, that I'm not seeing something they can't see, it's not always ignorance, but often it's that they just don't care if it causes problems for anyone else.  It's more important to them to be able to repeat a lame joke and feel like one of the ""normies"" than other people's ""fee-fees"".   

Telling people not to joke about attack helicopters also shuts down reasonable conversation when it makes people feel constrained and they start worrying about their fucking ""free speech"", like choosing not to be an arsehole is somehow a restriction of one's human rights. 

So it's a relief to go somewhere where the memes and jokes and mockery are aimed in a different direction.  Like a Bizarro world version of reddit."

> If you mean the physical reanimation of a corpse; I have no idea what that has to do with correct living and attitude.

I mean neither.  The first doesn't make much sense in the Christian story.  The second is to banal.  As Paul writes, we are resurrected as spiritual bodies.  Jesus retained his wounds, yet could walk through walls.  He could eat, but was only recognized in the breaking of the bread.  The Resurrection is not simply the reanimation of a corpse.  Lazarus comes back from the dead and he's not King of the Jews.

The Resurrection is the beginning of the new eschatological reality which we will join into in our own Resurrection.  The new heaven and new earth.  The morality of Jesus prefigures this new reality, this Kingdom of God that is here (in Christ) and not yet (in the eschaton) and calls us to act it out in anticipation."

Wow, just wow. No one is saying theism is bigoted because it believes a sky daddy is real. Nice strawman... We are saying you are members of a bigoted belief system because of what the rules, and standards, are in your religion. Islam has a major dislike for gay people because some uppity asshole from the 7th century had a problem with it. Jihad doctrine against those who don't believe, aka the neglected duty (like the christians, and jews, and their jihad doctrine on killing unbelievers), makes them bigoted. The Qur'an (as well as the bible) says not to take disbelievers as friends because allah does not guide the wrong doers. This is bigoted.


The burden of proof is on the one making the claim, I.E. YOU! You haven't met your burden of proof which is why atheists lack a belief in a deity. Essentially what you are trying to say is that we believe in a lack of beliefs. I hope you understand how stupid you sound, not only to atheists, but to your fellow brethren/sisters. Atheism is not a belief, saying so is the exact same as saying abstinence is a sex position. So, how's that unmarried sex, bruh? Are you praying real hard to ask for allah's forgiveness?
