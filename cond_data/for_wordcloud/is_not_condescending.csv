"For me it's like temporarily having the flu. The real flu, not how most people use it to describe every time they're throwing up or have diarrhea. 

Those first 1-2 hours I wake up my mind is cloudy, I can't think straight. I have headache. My whole body feels weak. I stumble, bump into walls, my hands shake. I have no appetite. If I try and force down a breakfast I start gagging. 


Nothing I do seems to be able to change that. 

Like I said, I've tried sleeping a full 8 hours and waking up at 6 am for months at a time....I still feel sick.

The old website had it clearly stated that games were being judged on their creativity and their engagement but not necessarily on their playability. I can't find this criteria listed on the new site though. 
"""Your playing was atrocious"" -- I see this a lot and is totally acceptable.

""Why do you bother playing a game you obviously have no skill at"". -- I rarely see this, and when I do it gets downvoted.

The thing I like about this subreddit is that it's about cards, not about protecting peoples feelings."
"People act smug all the time on reddit, but I don't see the same posters every day being smug on the same sub-reddits posting the same shit every day. That's how it was on the social boards on Gamefaqs. 

Sure, I'll see the reddit ""celebs"" every now and then on the main subs, but it's no where near as bad as on Gfaqs. I bet if I went there again right now, I'd probably see the same people discussing the same stupid topics and/or complaining about the same dumb things like being a virgin. "
"The top comment on this sub a few weeks ago was something like “women are literally incapable of love like men are. They might be fond of you but they’ll never ever love you”. I’m paraphrasing but the comment was pretty pathetic. But what’s more pathetic was this sub’s reaction: top comment, guilded many times, everyone commenting how legitimate this statement was. It was appalling. 

The thread was something like “what’s your unpopular opinion” that shows up every other week. So people can try to claim that that’s why. But if I claimed I love kiddie porn or that beating women gives me a hardon, I would be downvoted to fuck in that thread. It wasn’t upvoted because it was unpopular; on the contrary, it was upvoted BECAUSE everyone agreed with it. That’s how those threads work. "
"As I've already stated several times $4 million was just an arbitrary round number chosen for convenience, as I have no idea how much typically gets bet on MMA.

But if you're focused on actual dollar amounts, I agree the NFL numbers give us a decent ballpark to work from. I could easily see a hyped MMA fight getting bet on significantly more than an average NFL game, so say $10 million. In that case, betting $1 million on Kimbo (spread out over a week) wouldn't drastically change the odds. So there still would be a nice chunk of money to be made there by betting $1 million on Kimbo and throwing the fight (ballpark of $300k)."
I'm sick of hearing people talk about how much of a circle jerk atheism is. I see anti-atheist comments dozens of times more often than blatant atheists saying they are more intelligent. Do you really think atheists in general are more imposing of their beliefs or more annoying about them than religious people? Maybe because they only have had a voice relatively recently and its easier to notice.

I called it dll because I have a client who has me knee deep in .Net. If I had called it an so, would you have wiggled your cock in my face and told me I created a dynamically linked library? Communication is communication, that entire line of thought had no place in this discussion except to stroke an ego that needs no more stroking.

Or the effort spent trying to describe when the requirements may not allow you to use a DLL immediately after quoting a statement that said the approach is good if you can do it and still meet your requirements.

Which was the important point. It's a technique that will work, and allow you to move to a Service w/o any interruption when it becomes obvious that it's needed (said DLL .... I mean so... can easily do the calls to the service in lieu of calling directly into the DB).

">Why is it immoral to marry a 14 year old?

Children are unable to make legal decisions for a reason; they are not mature enough to fully understand the ramification of their decisions. So it is my opinion that marrying a 14 year old is immoral because she is unable to provide informed consent.

>And why is it immoral for a woman to be married to multiple men?

The act alone isn't. But the fact that these women were tricked into thinking he was some kind of prophet plays a huge role in the immorality of the situation. We have laws against con artists for a reason. Also, were they forced into it? Pressured by their husbands? There is no way to definitively say yes or no, but I would find it hard to believe that all of them were of their own free will.

I am 100% for it. If people want to engage in this, then that is fine by me. But I take issue when people are coerced into the situation, which is too often the case. "

Specifically, if your mindset is all or nothing then that’s probably rough. On the other hand, playing doubles advocate, it is hard to have friendships with women without being romantically interested.

Also, it’s weird to me that being in a romantic relationship with someone implies that I want to have sex with you. I didn’t look at dating like that."

That analogy doesn't work at all, for a number of reasons.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking him why he chose this.

>Before he went into this, I am sure he looked at all the possible avenues and decided that electricity is the best, or that it would be the most profitable.

And asking him to explain why is something people should do.

>Let's say, hypothetically, Hydrogen is way better than electric. How would it look if the CEO Tesla Motors said ""Yeah, it really is better, but we don't want the best""

Then you're excusing him for being a dishonest asshole. As it happens, hydrogen fuel cells are completely impractical but there is no reason to be an asshole to someone who is asking why that is.

>The question is pretty much useless in this context.

Except for explaining to people his reasoning. Explaining why hydrogen is worse (and it is) than batteries is not useless, and I have no idea why you'd even begin to think that's true.

"I routinely contribute to the GNOME project with code for the past 5 years, and I had a very different experience. People are generally supportive and friendly, specially with newcomers. I'm really curious to know who behaved like this with you.

> There is no customization without using extensions [...]

Please enlight me here: if not by extensions, how do you expect to customize your desktop experience? With a specific app with tons of checkboxes? Oh wait, there is one already - and it's made by GNOME contributors, surprise! :)

> the APIs for them change in every release as the Gnome devs don't think you should be using them

That's the price for the extreme customizability of Shell. People monkey-patch it. It allows extensions developers do whatever they want; but also removes the guarantee of stability. Either a few extensions break every release, or Shell stops being developed in the fear of breaking extensions...

And no, pretty much the opposite; I even see some contributors fixing GNOME Shell by first testing their changes in the form of extensions. Or prototyping crazy new stuff with them. The ability to have extensions is not only supported, but also desired.

> ""a little css to set the shell font""? Are you fucking kidding me? Any normal DE would have a configuration option to change this with a GUI, rather than asking you to write code.

"I must disagree, and honestly, I'm pretty baffled by this. I've been programming in C since about 1986. I have a lot of books on C. K&R is not a very good tutorial, or reference. It's perhaps a good introduction. It's not comprehensive, occasionally misleading, and fails to be very clear on several critical aspects of the language:

- rules for numerics (especially integral promotion, the semantics of division, and other critical details). For an example, see this blog post:

 http 

- the semi-equivalency between arrays and pointers. For a detailed example of how K&R mis-educates programmers on this critical distinction, see Peter van der Linden's book Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets_.

I've had K&R on my shelves at various programming jobs for over 20 years, right next to Summit's C Programming FAQs_, Harbison and Steele's C: A Reference Manual_, Plauger's The Standard C Library_, Koenig's C Traps and Pitfalls -- not to mention the ISO standard. K&R is the one that I pull out the least often.

UPDATE: I'm not really intending to hate on Kernighan... or Ritchie. Their contributions to the field of software engineering are beyond reproach. They're humble, and freely admit some of C's design compromises. I'm just not sure where The C Programming Language really fits these days, just like Software Tools in Pascal is seminal and interesting but not entirely practical. Is it a useful introduction to programming in general, or the C family of languages in general? Maybe, but I think it's more likely to make new developers frustrated. Maybe it's best considered an introduction to the underlying philosophy of C?

"I think the problem is that there are a lot of groups representing victims, making these surveys, who want you to feel victimized. By increasing the social definition of sexual assault to match or exceed the legal one (i.e., in almost all of those cases you were ""legally"" assaulted, whether you felt that way or not), they increase visibility (and funding) for their own causes.

Certainly there are women who feel like they have been victims in some of the scenarios where you feel like you weren't. Those women are totally justified to feel that way about their experience and to classify it as assault, just like you are completely justified to not believe it is assault. It is most definitely a grey area, but unfortunately surveys do not generally handle these cases very well. Indeed, as we have seen in the media, the response is almost more like ""OMG THESE POOR WOMEN DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED!"""
"First, you may need to go back and read the things I wrote previously. I mentioned illness or other issues at one point I'm sure. (If its this thread but with another person, pardon me.)

I don't know how many times I can say the same thing without just giving up. 

You're trying to tell me that you judge the likelihood of communicated facts being true based on the probability that you think they are true. 

I'm telling you that I based the likelihood of communicated facts being true based on the history of past experiences with the source of the communication. 

I'm not sure why you don't understand this:

1. If source A has provided me with 10000 facts over a period of ten years, when source A provided me with fact 10001, I would assume this fact were true. 

2. Of source B has provided me with 10000 facts over a period of ten years and every single one of those has turned out to be incorrect, when source B provided fact 10001, I would assume this fact were not true. 

What you want me to say is that the details of the facts provided are what I should use to judge the likelihood that information is true. In the event that the fact provided is in an area in which I am an expert (through experience, education, or the like) and I have a set of previous information of which to make a proper and valuable evaluation, then this would be the case. Otherwise, not at all. 

If someone tells me something about which I already know many things, I might feel comfortable estimating a probability of the truth of a claim. But this set of things (the ones about which I know a lot) is small. Most things would be outside it.

I would like to know how your process works. Given that you only believe things are true based on the probability that you think they are true, you must already know a great deal about any given subject before you are presented with new information. 

Regarding my specific belief system, I was only ever arguing that belief in miracles is a product of your worldview. I did not set out to make any proof of miracles, since that would go directly against my original argument. "
"Because you're misinterpreting the etymology of ""patronize"". Sure, at some distant linguistic root it derived from the Latin pater ""father"", but it's much more recent antecedent is ""patron"". As in the patron-client relationship as often epitomized in ancient Rome
, in which the rich benefactor (patron) would bestow, money, goods, or opportunities on a recipient (client) in exchange for favors ( works of art, literary mentions, advantageous business propositions, etc) - like a sugar daddy, but without the sex. Since the system was by its nature hierarchical, to patronize someone is by definition a commentary on their status.

 In more modern times the word has evolved the mean something more in line with treating someone like a customer, and I think everyone has had the experience of being ""patronized"" by an employee trying to sell them something.

 Thus ""patronize"" means to treat someone as an inferior or or to regard them as easily manipulable. 


I realize that in the hysteria for gender equality people might be trying to search for the female equivalent of such a term, but it simply doesn't exist. That's because, due to the English convention of the unknown/neutral defaulting to male (c.f. ""he"" being used to designate The Unknown Subject), this term is in fact gender-neutral. It's the same reason why you would describe an overbearing and intrusive government as ""paternalistic"" (without the need to alternatively use ""maternalistic"").

"> Because there are fundamental problems within the Quran.

Well yes and no. Have you read the bible? Both are rambling and incoherent texts with violent and backward messages in them. The issue is when people take them literally. Some Christians do and they take them literally and go and blow up abortion clinics etc., in Islam the literal interpretation are essentially confined to the one sect that are committing all the terrorism. Again, do you even know who they are? People love saying that the Quran is supposed to be taking literally. The reality is that even it is meant to, it isn't. How do I know? Because the proof is in the pudding by all the non extremists. The other critical thing to be taken with the Quran are the Hadiths. They are wide, subjective and vary from sect to sect.

"> The more intelligent and logical you are the less likely you are to be successful with women. Women in general do not find logical thought processes attractive, they find emotional variety attractive. The stereotype of the 30 year old virgin computer programmer exists for a reason. This does not mean that us heartless rational emotionless nerds can't get laid it just means we have to loosen up and have more fun in social situations.

If you come at her like fucking Data from Star Trek, yeah, that might be a little weird. Because Data is not human, you see, and if you act like a computer/robot, perhaps she's going to be a little weirded out.

Most people find emotional variety attractive. It's why people get annoyed with people who have constantly, unerringly sunny, bubbly personalities. If you have but one mode of operation, people get frustrated with you, because you aren't responding to the cues around you and are barreling forward with your approach, other people be damned. Even if you don't mean to, it comes off as arrogant and impersonal.

It's not ""logic"" that turns women off. It's the lack of tact a lot of self-described ""logical people"" use. They think they can say and do whatever's ""most logical"" and think that they are separate from their own emotions. Emotions are garbage and useless and only get in the way, right? Well, most people experience emotions and that is part of their logic and should be. If you're the kind of person who thinks that emotions are dumb, a lot of people are turned off by that, because they experience emotions (and so do you, and it makes you look pompous)."

I fear that white people will be mass murdered in the near future by a bunch of armed millennial racists. Don't get me wrong, some white people are still racists too. My point is that all these people are emerging who are just as ignorant and violent as the old school racists were back then, to ALL of the white people of today.

Just like how with today's feminists, far too many of them are blaming ALL men for ALL the bad things.

"You've obviously not lived in Scotland. Up till very recently, Scotland was treated with a lot of contempt and sometimes outright racism by a lot of people. And I don't mean the light hearted banter we usually have. I mean outright contempt, especially from people living in or around London.

My Mum's cousin worked for the Open University. She once went down to London for a thing and whilst at a function she asked if she could use the phone. The person she asked took her to the phone and attempted to show her how to use the phone. She stopped this person half way saying she knew how to use the phone and the person looked at her and said ""You mean they have phones up there?""

Politicians often acted disparagingly toward Scotland and Scottish autonomy, calling Scotland ""just a region"" (we're talking about a home nation here) and dismissing any suggestion of Scottish autonomy as being as pointless as giving Autonomy to a county. We're talking about a place as big as Ireland in area and twice as big in population, on top of that with it's own (at the time limited) laws and education system as guaranteed by the Act of Union (1707) and we had politicians, many of whom have never been to Scotland treating the place like a County! Add to that Thatcher using Scotland as a guinea pig for a Poll Tax. Politicians would often neglect Scotland for things like investment in favour of England and the South East.

Even in the media there was and dare I say still is some contempt. Small events in London like a stabbing would get coverage on national news but only the biggest events would get coverage if they happened in Scotland. Everything was and dare I say is, London centric and Scots were, and dare I say still sometimes are treated with a large degree of active contempt where people treated the Scots like Kilt wearing, drunken barbarians who were incapable of self governance. Even today, with local BBC stations, you'll notice cities like Oxford and Sheffield have their own BBC stations (England has 39 altogether) when Scotland only have two: BBC Scotland and BBC Alba/Nan Gael. one of England's stations covers an audience of 140,000 whereas the population of Edinburgh is over four times.

As the national anthem says (albeit for a different event) ""those days are past now, and in the past they must remain"". The relationship with our southern neighbours and their image of us has improved greatly. We have our own parliament, our economy has improved in a big way, we're now being seen as a home nation rather than just a region, but this tweet gives you a taste of the sort of contempt people in England treated Scots with in the past. Piers Morgan is a shiny faced twat and dare I say, a xenophobe with a contemptuous attitude toward the Scots.

TL;DR: Scots faced this attitude a lot from people like Piers."

"I have no qualms with this ""main issue"" in A Woman is a Woman or Vivre se Vie because while they obviously include references, the films themselves are not belabored by them. As I said about Contempt in the latter part of my capsule:

>it's so taxingly parabolic that it cripples its own superficial enjoyment. 

Or, to put it another way, I just don't think Contempt offers itself to surface-level pleasure the same way some of his other films do. Just because YOU think Contempt is exciting or beautiful or enjoyable or whatever adjective you want to use, doesn't mean I necessarily do. And quite frankly, I think outside of a few scenes here and there, it's a giant bore that's dragged down by Godard's attempts at over saturated allusion.

I also think his take on things (anything, really) from women, to the government, to the filmmaking industry, to romance, and beyond, often bogs the merriment, gusto, or even on some occasions, the more bleak aspects of his films, and comes off like either (1) a checklist of references and winks and pats on the back, or (2) a glorified PSA. Had the same problems with e.g. 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her.

A Woman is a Woman and Vivire Sa Vie, since you decided to use those as conflicting counterpoints, don't require knowledge of anything, really, although they do contain various signposts, homages, references, etc. They are completely entertaining for their own sake, not because of all the obscure references that Godard has tried to cram into them. The jovial spontaneity of A Woman is a Woman or the formal gambit of Vivre Sa Vie are far and away more amusing -- to ME -- than anything Godard has to offer with Contempt. The scene in A Woman is a Woman where Emile and Angela are arguing with books or in Vivre Sa Vie when Nana is being read the ""rules"" of prostitution -- there's nothing in Contempt nearly half as alluring or arresting or even unique as these moments alone. It's a film that's so constantly concerned with connecting the dots and proverbial rib-nudging that it forgets to actually be lively and convivial on its own merits. 

It's honestly shocking to me that you think comparisons against A Woman is a Woman and Vivre Sa Ve are even remotely necessary, as the sheer density of Contempt puts it in an entirely different weight class when it comes to Godard's personal musings. It's way too hampered with ""nods"" and ""winks"" and if you don't catch a good portion of those (or, choose not to praise a film based on its irrelevant allegorical register, as I have done), you'll find that that its pretty damn hollow otherwise.

Also not sure why you've decided to undertake a tone of condescension in your reply. I'm sorry I don't like Contempt? But it's a self-important, cumbersome slog for much of its run-time, even from a strictly superficial standpoint, it's weak compared to A Woman is a Woman, Breathless, Vivre Sa Vie, Pierrot le Fou, etc."

>Europeans are the most socially, technologically, culturally advanced people in the world. European culture is superior in every way. I'm not a white nationalist though before you feebly accuse me of that, because it's our culture that is superior, not genetics, and other people can be welcomed into that culture if they abandon their depraved barbarity.
British wealth was built up via the industrial revolution, and as you can see, Europe advanced ahead of Asia before the industrial revolution and widespread colonialism even began. It wasn't Indian silk and spices that made Britain rich, it was our own native coal resources.

A question for you: if you think you do understand the concept, then please explain to me what it means for something to be inherently valuable. Once you do that, then explain how your questions make any sense.

> Now, if someone claims that ""diversity"" is something that should be considered as inherently valuable, then it should be possible for that person to list their reasons...

No it shouldn't. And if you truly understood the concept of inherent value, then you would understand this. 

Another question for you: for what reasons do you consider happiness to be inherently valuable? Do you understand how nonsensical this question is?

> ...or to explain their thought process that leads them to that conclusion.

I have no idea what the hell that means. What's your thought process for coming to consider happiness to be inherently valuable? It's nonsense.

"I've seen a lot of work-related feminist ideas prop up (""Women are underprivileged in the workplace,"" ""They're going against the establishment,"" and so forth). The other one I've seen has been the ""Women are strong"" kinds of mentality. 

When does it come up? The former is when people want to leverage their situation. If it's a situation where women do not want to do some type of work, the victim card sometimes come up (note that this is with some very specific and entitled women, which is also interesting because these people end up stepping over pretty much every other human being to have that advantage, regardless of gender).

The latter comes up when talking about policy differences, and I'm not entirely sure to whom they're speaking towards. Because it all sounds so fake. Usually these types of women typically, in the heat of the moment or during some critical leading positions, end up backing off and become useless.

All of these usually come out without any real context. The sexism that a 50 or 60 year old woman has faced is far more obvious and rampant than a 20 or 30 year old woman. My issue is mostly with the 20-30 year old ""feminists"" that have been grasping for whatever ""social justice"" they can to make it seem like their lives are ""unfair."" Their lives, in many ways, have been far more entitled as an attempt to offset the blatant sexism of older women, and it's frankly just gotten stupid.

Here's the thing though. There's women that absolutely do not bring these sorts of things up, and they're some of the strongest, hardest working, most able individuals. I don't think it's the decrying of problems that's at issue, it's the use of these to stake some sort of unfair position because they can. You're not exactly ""strong and independent"" if you cannot accept criticism and have to fall back on victimhood. And that's quite different from actual policy debates that are sexist and deserve true attention."

According to hard determinism it doesn't matter whether you tell axelior to do something or not, it doesn't matter whether he 'chooses' to be nice to bigots or not.. all causes and all effects are inevitable and will unfold exactly how they unfold. Making a 'choice' that might result in a more moral universe is impossible.

Hell I don't even disagree with your initial assertion that one should treat people with respect even if they have bigoted beliefs. One could argue in favor of this from a practical perspective, that it leads to better outcomes than shaming bigots. Or from a moral perspective, that all people deserve respect regardless of views.

It's understandable why Hayato would be like that because Hachiman acted like a prick to get the information from him and end things quickly, just like he did on some other occasions. Plus, he was stressed out from the events prior. Cut him some slack.

"Ughhhhhhhhhh for fuck's sake. Literally what even is the point of this subreddit.

Let's suppose that any of what they're saying is true-- that all across the globe, men are being unfairly treated by women, are overwhelmingly the victims of female-instigated violence, are suffering as a result of kangaroo courts ruled over by matriarchal man-haters. (Because there's definitely no such thing as a [man violent against women, even young girls receiving a light sentence, oh no.] ( http  Nope. And this is [not another example] ( http #page=1) because that doesn't happen. Not a systemic [problem] ( http  anywhere in the world, no.) Okay. Let's take their delusional premise and run with it.

If the rights of half of humanity were being infringed upon? And you think you're the only people who are noticing it? First of all: you don't call your upset ""PUSSY PASS."" You give it a real, appropriate name based on the party you want to empower, not the one that you dislike. ""Quiet Strength: The Campaign to Reduce Gendered Violence Against Men."" (That's a freebie, you're welcome.)

And then-- this is the big point-- you organize. You substantively organize. I'm talking pooling money for decent lawyers to defend your brothers in arms, if they're being taken advantage of by the court system. I'm talking making pamphlets about how all violence is bad violence, and gender is no excuse for harming anyone. (Don't start with the ""but what if the bitch slapped me and I need to--"" No. Start with ""all violence is bad violence"" and move from there.)

""B-b-but the Feminazis are going to attack us!"" Firstly, watch your tone-- calling people feminazis is never going to curry favour with the mainstream, you dumb idiot. Furthermore, if you ever do anything for any reason, you're going to get critics. In this case, maybe some more hardline feminists would criticize you, yes. But if you really believe that half of humanity is being taken advantage of, you learn to cope with a little criticism. People are going to spit in your face. People are going to call you a fool. People are going to scream the worst expletives possible at you. There's even an outside chance that they may slap you, which I recognize is a big issue with this crowd. If the fight is worth fighting, you endure.

The suffragettes used to throw themselves in front of trains and horses, to go on extended hunger strikes; protectors of abortion rights face violence and death threats day in and day out. Queers get death threats and rape threats and harassment left, right and centre but still continue activism. You want to change something? You have to be fearless.

So yeah: mass organizing, fundraising, protesting, hunger strikes. That's what gets the ball rolling. You know what doesn't? Referring to women as ""pussies"" (thanks for reducing us to the only part you find valuable, lol), complaining online without any of the above structures in place, and focusing on the negative. Stand together in solidarity, don't banter about how much you want to knock a bitch out.

Men's rights-- even fringe groups like this one-- would do so much better if they did less negative chatter and more collective organizing. If you want to stop what you consider to be an epidemic, put your hand in your pocket and start a legal fund! Protest positively and peacefully: not saying ""women who claimed to be raped are probably just having regret the morning after"" (ew) but ""those who rape men get inappropriately short prison sentences, or none at all."" Positive language about your cause, not diminishing other people.

Not even the Wikipedia page ever truly states what religion he is, because it doesn't matter, he intentionally hid them in order to appeal to the most amount of Germans. Also, Catholics in Nazi Germany were actively oppressed (as in, literally). For example, the Hitler Youth was encouraged to attack members of the Catholic youth groups in the street.

An awful and horrific event. But the very presence of the Anglican clergy disproves your point. The Anglican denomination, as you know, does not answer to the Pope, and is thus not Catholic. Atrocities committed against aboriginals as attempts to assimilate them occurred all over the planet. The Canadian Indian residential school system, the Stolen Generations in Australia, the forced assimilation of various European colonies in Africa, and especially the treatment of Native Americans in the United States, which Adolf Hitler would explicitly name as a shining inspiration in Mein Kampf.

That is wonderful for you, I am not nor have I. You can change the argument to say any specific socialist ideology and be correct, it is an ideology, but I am not talking about a specific socialist ideology but the philosophy of socialism.

>Socialism is when business is controlled by the labor force, rather than by private individuals

Once again you are not talking about philosophic socialism you are talking about market socialism. The philosophy is that the benefit of labor should be given to the one doing the labor. That is where ideological socialism (communism in this case) tried and failed, by having the government own the businesses. As a side note, you are jumping into a rather unfair argument as a philosophy never needs to prove that it works, only that it is what is true, while an ideology needs to prove that it is both the way things are and a way that works.

You can scream right up until the 20 people kick your ass and take your things that they shouldn't use coercion, doesn't change that their action was a gain for them and there was no real penalty for them doing so.

That's like saying ""Well, you've been paying me for all the work I've done, but now I feel I also own your business. You know... just because I've worked here so long. I mean, it's not like you've been busy managing the business or took the initial risk to start the business.""

I can do straw men too! If you say a person is being compensated for the labor but another person decides what portion of their labor they get you are creating slaves! Slavery is bad! 

To move past that, you argue on the grounds that a person can own the resource which is outside the philosophy argued and again moving into the economic socialist ideology. So, congratulations on a nested straw man argument

Seriously though, can you argue that the more a person works on a resource the more they should earn? You can attach whatever stipulation you want to it but at the end of the day if I put in 2 hours and you put in 4 hours of the exact same work that produces the exact same value you should earn more.

>Unless I spent my life savings to afford the TNT to open the mine, and purchase all the equipment that would allow you to work in the mine in the first place.

That would take a great deal more than an hour of your time and a great deal more resources than you could earn on your own. You are again injecting economics into an argument on philosophy. Also, you are not using equal footing as a starting point, you are assuming one worker has more ability to do work and produce than another. All things being equal the person working 10 hours should make more than the person working 1 hour.

>See, this is why you don't see any business owners who are also socialists. Socialists tend to know nothing about what it takes to start and run an enterprise.

Communism mike drop

Haha, seriously though, that is another application of a philosophy. You are, again, arguing a form of ideology not a philosophy. I don't see many whales running whaling ships either! Haha, nested straw man number two, color me impressed.

>And I think I've destroyed that argument of ""fairness"" by demonstrating how insanely unfair that view is. If I hire a babysitter to watch my kid because I'm busy working (Ironically, to also pay the sitter) does that mean the sitter has more claim to my child than I do? The argument falls apart quickly once tested for practical integrity.

You literally replied with this to my argument that more work should be paid more than less work...I just wanted to point that out...

As for the straw man...err...babysitter argument, you are arguing that anybody can own a baby and the baby has no self ownership! sorry, nested straw man number three.

As I again point out, a philosophy is not a functional idea on how to use a thing, only an idea on what a thing is. In this case labor is ownership of said labor. To jump into the babysitter (please don't) argument the babysitter owns their labor, not the resource. Any other babysitter can be hired for the same labor on the same resource and the one who works the best or is the cheapest would get the work.

>So, socialism doesn't suggest that private ownership over the means of production is wrong?

It argues that it is a social construct. If you stuck 10 people on an island and one person claimed everything on the island was theirs so the other 9 have to work on the island, the other 9 would ignore the claim as it is baseless. That is the core of every resource worked on the planet, at some point it was common use until somebody got enough people to agree it was theirs. The second people stop looking at it that way it ceases to be theirs again. Hence, a social construct.

>So, why do socialists get to decide what the ""natural order"" is? By the way, socialism is hardly associated with anything concerning facts. Just look at the labor theory of value.

First off, Socialists do not get to decide anything. It is an idea, which really means it can only be acted upon not act itself. 

As for part 2, again, economic socialism is the labor theory of value. Philosophic Socialism is only that the same labor should have the same value.

>Perhaps if they weren't voluntarily being compensated otherwise. It would be a dick move if I cut my neighbors grass, they paid me, and then I claimed that they no longer own their yard.

STRAW MAAAAAAAAAANNNNN!!!!! Haha, seriously, is that like number 6 or 7, I lost count. Anyway, you should be compensated for work done, that is about as far as it goes. If somebody wants to incur the costs of ""owning"" grass then they incur the cost of having it mowed. Assuming no ownership of resources, as is the Philosophy, you would be talking about land, in which case mowing would have no value and not be a valued labor unless pest control was involved.

>Unfortunately for socialism, the value of labor is subjective.

indeed it is, did you have a point here? We are talking about the same labor for different amounts of time.

>Are you suggesting that individuals in a privately owned business aren't working together?

Nope, I could call this another fallacy but I grew exhausted slaying the evil straw men. The philosophy is that people working together are more productive. You don't believe businesses are places where people work together?

>While I have no problem with worker-owned business, I do have a problem with it being mandated that all business be worker-owned... Thanks, but no thanks.

That is completely fine, you can be against any ideology you want. Just remember, the Socialism we have been discussing has been a philosophy."
"There's a difference between expressing criticism and expressing anger. You were engaging in stigmatizing behavior towards someone unnecessarily, and that perturbed me, so I explained my objection.

(Not ""the same as banning porn"", but conceptually related to movements to ban porn or resemblant of the logic behind bans on porn.) That is all.

">I mean that the order of the universe suggests something supernatural.

I refer you to Douglas Adams's water puddle. And, the argument from design is based primarily on an argument from ignorance. You have no evidence of the supernatural, but you can't think of any better explanation. So, you just claim that a supernatural explanation must be the right one. That isn't how logic works.

You have also made a blind assertion by saying that it suggests something supernatural. Why? What reason do you have to claim this?

No one is saying that the universe came from nothing. This is a strawman.

>The evidence is that its the best fit hypothesis regarding the question of existence.

Blind assertion and an argument from ignorance. I could just as easily say that the best explanation for the existence of life is magical fairies. I don't have to support this. The evidence is all around you. How else do you explain the order of the universe or the fact that you are alive? It's only reasonable to conclude that it was magic.

This is the best that someone with formal education in logic can do? Anyone who has done five minutes worth of research on Wikipedia studying logical fallacies can find the errors in your argument.

">The thing that always gets lost in discussions on inflation is why it occurs, and this is because there's more demand for goods than there is ability to produce them. A lot of people having more money raises aggregate demand, which is either met with economic growth or with inflation.

>It also would have driven up prices so that all the people making 9.50 (which mostly includes everyone making 9.50 or less already) would be effectively making less than minimum wage is right now.

Granted, I ignored the possibility of economic growth, but in my experience inflation is the likely result.

Its nice to hope it will be different, but it would be better to find a replacement system that would work regardless of how employers reacted to it."
">Doesn't that go against the whole democratic process?

Yes, but the whole point of the strategy is that apparently the Repub's rules are NOT entirely democratic.

So he's trying to get extra votes in those states even if the overall populace of the state doesn't want him. Then in the end, when the convention plays by ""whoever is over 1,144 wins"", he could end up having enough. Or, at the very least, rob the others of enough to cause a deadlock."

"> No, it's a sexist term by definition.

By what definition? It doesn't generalise or stereotype as discussed earlier; it's a description of a form of prejudice. That we have words to clarify instances of prejudice one wishes to speak about is not inherently prejudice. Also just the presence of ""man"" in the name you have great issue with, as though talking about the issue of 'how women are treated' is fine but 'how men treat women' is not. A gendered term is not discrimination by itself.

I said I wouldn't repeat myself but you're really struggling with this one. There is nothing about the word black that says anything about crime. You are making that association when you define it and so your conception of the word is racist. This is completely and entirely distinct from black crime and male explanations, where black and male literally mean black and male.

>Sooner or later people run out of ways to defend their sexism.

I only run out when you stop making new points. The entire blacking tangent is no way analogous and yet it's entirely derailed the discussion for several comments. You seem to think it's an airtight point but it doesn't hold any water at all, so you should invest less in that particular idea."
"Speaking as a South African, watching people on reddit talk about Africa is a pretty surreal experience. 

In the first place, it's all lumped into a single entity, which is crazy considering the size of the continent. Like, to me a Zimbabwean is as foreign as a Mexican is to an American, and I know as little about what's going on in Mogadishu or Khartoum as anyone else. Yet people feel comfortable making these super broad and reductionist statements.

Second, the suffering of certain Africans is so horribly normalised. And, to be frank, I think large part of it is a colonial holdover of extremely low expectations for black people in particular. This comes from both sides really (not equally so, but still), with left-wing condescension on one hand and right-wing contempt on the other. From a South African point of view in particular, it really gets my goat when redditors talk about how bad white people have it here. I'm white myself, and there are complicated sociopolitical questions regarding whiteness in SA, but the way it's discussed by redditors is so telling. Just about every stat you can look at bears out that poverty and suffering is far, far more prevalent among the black population in SA. But black suffering is normalised, expected, and it's only newsworthy when it's white people suffering.

In my experience, racism mostly doesn't even manifest in forthright contempt, but in low expectations. Slavers justified slavery by saying black people could not look after themselves. Today we justify the suffering in parts of Africa by saying they can't be expected to live in peace.

I don't deal a lot with parents personally, but sometimes parents get upset, especially when we bring up homosexuality (but not just because of that). Frankly, some parents feel entitled to control everything their children hear or see, especially when it comes to sex. I hate those kinds of parents. :P

Frankly though, the vast majority of parents support good sex education (85% of U.S. parents support having comprehensive sex ed in schools), and they're glad that there's people who can help them out with that role. Bitching parents are a vocal minority, but a very small minority.

 Have you broken out the ol' banana for demonstration?

I actually used to hand out a banana to each student to practice putting on a condom. I use a realistic, wooden penis for my own demonstration. I use the realistic cock to do some education about what the average penis size really is (5.25"" in lenght and girth for an erect adult, most guys are smaller than the average). Now that I do sex ed on a more regular basis, I've stopped handing out bananas - I hand out glue sticks instead for when the students practice.

"Woah, that's putting a lot of words in my mouth. I'll get to that after the political stuff about 2016 though

2016 is not a party realignment. In a party realignment a party dies and is replaced, or undergoes such extreme transformation that it breaks with it's previous traditions, thus leading to a large flux in the balance of power between the parties. The democratic party moved slightly left on various issues. That is not party realignment. 

Not only that but what lost Clinton the election was about a dozen different things. Voter apathy, Trump's successful appeal to white America, electoral college and so on and so forth. The democratic party has a lot to look at, and I'm sure they'll find they don't need to politically realign just to win again. Hell Trump is the best democratic recruitment drive since Nixon. 

If any party is even close to realigning it's the Republican party, they're split between the Trump radicals and the moderates that are more like Kasich. They also have to battle the fact that less than 20% of their votes come from minorities in an increasingly diverse country. If they don't take steps to expand their base they'll become effectively powerless nationally within 30 years.

Now for the words you put in my mouth. It's not defeatism to acknowledge the fact that our voting system actively leads to two party systems. It's also not defeatism to acknowledge that the party that most Americans voted for will not be undergoing party realignment. Party realignment is a drastic change. Third party voting won't start that. Third party voting can, not necessarily will, lead to a party modifying their platform.

Yes the government is accountable to us, but as political studies have shown our winner takes all system leads to two party systems where various situations lead to people voting for candidates they hate less than the other candidate, rather than one they like. 

And also I hate to break it to you, the government already barely works for us. The amount of money you have is a direct indicator of how likely you are to see reforms you want passed. It takes overwhelming public support from poorer people in order to get their way. That rarely happens so they rarely get their way. The rich on the other hand get their way frequently. 

I'm simply recognizing the problems with our political system and pointing them out to you. They're issues we live with because our system isn't changing. If you can manage to get millions of democrats to vote third party, then awesome you'll possibly start a party realignment towards something you want. Short of that your vote won't effect much besides your morality unfortunately. And I never said you have to compromise work with it. I said if you don't nothing will happen because others will. Short of going out and organizing massive sweeping political movements Duverger's Law tells us the two party system will lock people into voting for candidate (Democrat in the case of left leaning people) they think has a shot at beating the one they hate more.

And ""Bernie or bust"" is strange to me considering Bernie endorsed Clinton and actively worked with the democratic party to help incorporate parts of his platform. That's the goal right? The primaries got Clinton to pick up parts of free college, single payer rhetoric, and so on, yet that's not enough? I'm not a fan of the democratic party myself and yet even I thought that was pretty good for a single primary run."

All this picture is saying is that it's stupid to bend the knee to these kinds of voices, because intent and context are important.

Then, if I read a story that makes me unhappy, I have the whole rest of the day to feel better.

"I read through your reply with care. My conclusion is that your position as outlined is a post-hoc rationalisation for the rejection of religion on other grounds (about which I will not speculate) because, despite your confidence and certitude (and condescension) the rational warrant simply isn’t there.

>You start with the most basic assumptions … most of science, since by logic and perception we derive scientific truths.

The idea that “most of science” can be included among the set of basic assumptions from which we will operate in looking at the proposition that God exists is presuppositional. It is also facile and unwarranted.

Then you say,

>if an argument for a god or Christianity can independently remain consistent, and not depend on other a priori assumptions besides what's already in the shoebox, you can add that argument into the shoebox 

Remembering that your shoebox contains the set of basic assumptions and evidence from which we will proceed to a conclusion, I am left with the creeping suspicion that I will be wasting my keystrokes by debating you. Seriously, dude. What the hell are you talking about? That we must prove our conclusion before adding it to the set of working assumptions by means of which we will then attempt to prove our conclusion.

Listen, if you want to be an atheist, you are free to do so. God himself has vouchsafed you the freedom to reject him. But don’t try to pass off the exercise of your moral and spiritual freedom to reject God as a necessary and therefore unavoidable outcome of a cogent line of reasoning when it is manifestly obvious to me that your “cogent line of reasoning” is neither cogent nor a line nor reasoning.

Two remaining possibilities, in descending order of probability, are that, firstly, ""you know what you mean"" and simply are not able to express yourself clearly or, secondly, that you are the first writer in my long journey through the philosophy of religion whom I am not equal to the task of comprehending.

Whichever the answer, I cannot see a credible prospect of a meaningful debate between us and therefore wish you the very best in your ongoing search for, or flight from, the truth.

You may have the last word if you wish.

The increase of panhandlers does not make any sense, there is no real reason for it, we have one of the best social safety nets in the world. Ontario Works helps people financially and to find jobs openly as long as you want to help yourself, there is also amazing programs to help people access education to improve their lives and trade training programs, not to mention the soup kitchens and food banks available. I understand sometimes people slip through the cracks and illness can make accessing help difficult, but I don't think us giving people cash and encouraging this behaviour is going to make it better. I strongly encourage people to think twice before giving them change, it is not going to make their lives better and it will most likely function as an incentive to not join the social programs available.

"Like them or not, SRS IS a productive part of Reddit. They have a sub with 20k subscribers, dozens of high traffic satellite subs, and a devoted and loyal user base that visits and contributes to the massive amount of traffic that Reddit receives daily. Maybe not as significant as many other subs, but you can't tell me that there isn't a lot of page churn going on in the Fempire. That means money for Reddit, that means SRS and the others subs on that list like OWS, LGBT and Anarchy are all contributing to the success of Reddit. 

They also happen to have the single largest and vocal minority population on Reddit. And they and people that you arbitrarily decide are part of their group are being systematically removed and excluded from a subreddit who's sole purpose is to commune with the other moderators on the site including a significant amount of access to the Reddit admins. 

So maybe you think that all you're doing is trying to keep things quiet, but what you are actually doing is silencing minority voices and preventing them from having access to an environment where they may have some sort of impact on future decisions made by the admins.

Joint training exercises are vital for defense. To back off such an exercise is literally telling our allies all over the world that we are less committed to joint defense.

So to be clear on that point 2...tyrant makes nukes. Our response is to sign an agreement saying we take our nukes away.

"I lived as a man for fifteen years. :p I'm not blind to men's issues. And honestly, most women can't afford to be--our culture rather openly explores men's issues, though it seems curiously inept at seeing how many of them stem from sexism trying to groom men as Masters of the Universe and casting them coldly aside if they're, you know, just normal people. Women tend to know this. 

But a lot of men are blind to women's issues. When men care about things that affect women as much, as informedly, and as thoughtfully as women are required to care about men's if they want to fit into our society, then we can just call it all ""human issues"" and probably solve most of them. Until now, as a woman and a feminist, I'm going to focus my attention on problems that affect women and seek win-win solutions. "

>“What Have You Done for Women?”How Rose McGowan’s anti-trans bias weakens her feminism.

>Last week, Rose McGowan abruptly cancelled her book tour following a confrontation at a Barnes & Noble with an audience member on Jan. 31. The protester, a trans woman, accused McGowan of not doing enough for trans women and was escorted out of the event by security while yelling “white cis feminism.” McGowan characterized the incident as a verbal assault and complained on Twitter that her staff and the audience had been insufficiently supportive of her in the wake of the incident.

>This isn’t the first time that McGowan, a former Weinstein victim who has vigorously contributed to the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment, has come into conflict with the transgender community. In 2015, McGowan wrote a Facebook post criticizing Caitlyn Jenner which read, in part, “You want to be a woman and stand with us- well learn us. We are more than deciding what to wear. We are more than the stereotypes foisted upon us by people like you. You’re a woman now? Well fucking learn that we have had a VERY different experience than your life of male privilege.” When her post was criticized for its transphobia, McGowan removed it and explained that she had only intended to be critical of Jenner’s comment that the hardest part of being a woman was deciding what to wear.

>That largely satisfied her trans critics until last July, when she appeared on RuPaul’s podcast What’s the Tee. In the episode, McGowan brought up the subject of trans women and complained that trans friends of hers had never asked what it was like to grow breasts or get a period. She then said of trans women: “They assume, because they felt like a woman on the inside, that’s not developing as a woman, that’s not growing as a woman, that’s not living in this world as a woman.”

>It’s clear from these comments that McGowan believes trans women fall short of full womanhood. She points to specific experiences that she considers central to true womanhood—having a period, growing breasts, being subjected to male attention at an early age. This trans-exclusionary idea of womanhood leads to an impoverished and incomplete feminism, one that doesn’t just alienate trans people but also leaves out the experiences of many cis women.

>What could better epitomize the abuse faced by women and girls than the molestation of more than 150 women in gymnastics by physician Larry Nassar? But young female gymnasts train so hard that their young bodies often do not develop breasts or periods at the age-appropriate time—are their experiences thus not truly the experiences of women? In fact, there are many conditions that can result in a woman never having periods. Breasts come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, and at the end of the day, they’re just a bit of extra tissue—it makes as much sense to say that they’re essential to the experience of womanhood as it would to say that having 10 fingers is essential to the experience of humanity. Many women experience unwanted male attention—but unless you’re willing to say that a disabled woman who has never been treated as a sexual being because of her disability isn’t a real woman, then this experience can’t be at the heart of what it means to be a woman either.

>In fact, it’s easy to imagine a disabled woman with a condition that affects the development of both primary and secondary sex characteristics who has none of the traits that McGowan thinks are essential to womanhood—and who remains, stubbornly, defiantly, a woman.

>Trans men, on the other hand, may have once checked all of McGowan’s boxes and still benefited from male privilege as unambiguously as any cis man. An anecdote that trans neurobiologist Ben Barres likes to tell to illustrate this point is that a scientist who was unaware of Barres’ transition once said, “Ben Barres gave a great seminar today, but then his work is much better than his sister’s.” Ben Barres was the same person, doing the same work, but maleness gave that work more gravitas, at least to some of his colleagues.

>The point is not that a trans woman’s experience is identical to that of a cis woman but that the experiences of women vary widely, and that feminists who forget this—or undermine it in order to exclude trans women—weaken feminism immeasurably. If watching tampon ads as a girl is central to womanhood (another experience McGowan referenced), then what are we saying about girls who grow up without electricity? If being mistreated by men is at the heart of womanhood, then what room is there to imagine strong girls and women of the future who don’t go through any of that? If women and men are one day truly equal, will there still be men and women? I say yes. Trans-exclusionary feminists aren’t quite as sure.

>Last, but not least, there’s a danger in seeing girlhood as a permanent stain on one’s soul, something that damages a person irrevocably. Set aside the fact that there are such vast differences between cultures that it hardly makes sense to speak of “being raised female” as if it were a single thing. It dims the prospects for adult women to see these formative experiences as permanently crippling. If a trans woman who spends 20 years being perceived as a man and 60 years being perceived as a woman can’t be said to have experienced what it’s like to be a woman, then this means that early experiences of sexism are the most important fact of a woman’s life, and they can never be overcome. This fatalism, again, impoverishes feminism. It limits what we can hope for women growing up in an imperfect era and resigns us to a view of women as permanently damaged by childhood experiences of sexism.

>Feminism that includes trans women is far more hopeful. It allows for the recognition of difference, for the solidarity that grows out of many divergent paths, and for change and growth beyond ones’ formative experiences. It also leaves room for self-determination, for women and men to know themselves better from the inside than others know them from the outside, and to declare who they are without apology. Trans-inclusive feminism also allows trans men to acknowledge what they have in common with cis women, without forcing them to deny the privilege they may experience once they present as male. McGowan, and others like her, fear that trans people will take something away from feminism. In truth, trans experiences can support feminism and strengthen it.

>At the book signing, McGowan asked her protester, “What have you done for women?” The answer, Rose, if you’ll accept trans people who want to support you, is plenty. 

What a pretentious chode.

"If I recall, Clinton had a favorability of above 60%+ as Secretary of State.

Consider this -- 

 this has been an acrimonious primary in which all her past smears have been magnified within a Reddit bubble.

 Clinton supporters have stayed quiet this campaign season. Mainly for 2 reasons: 
(1) Bernie supporters have been violently vocal to the extent that even if Bernie had no flaws and was as angelic as being painted, such obeisance is just plain distasteful. (2) Quite a significant number of Bernie supporters, not all, resemble the vocal anger that the right displayed with Obama's election, many Clinton supporters are moderates and centrists preferring to maintain calm discussions because when a person displays obvious signs of anger, a discussion is not possible (For an anecdotal evidence, just check my comment history and responses to downvoted comments, only a few give me a reasoned explanation of why my comment was wrong, most others just display naked hatred)

 Finally, Clinton has taken a lot easy on Sanders this time round perhaps learning from her 2008 campaign. This is an intelligent candidate who knows that given the nature of Sanders support and the intense youth energy she has to tread carefully to ensure bridges are easy to establish later on. There is a sophistication in this approach that is easily lost on those with little context of earlier iterations here. It has the downside of letting wild narratives run away for a brief while, but given she gets the nomination makes it much easier to unify everyone. And in case she doesn't get the nomination, it wouldn't matter anyway. 


Moderates and centrists who really make up a large number of Americans are very much in support of Hillary Clinton. Evidence for this lies in actual votes cast which far exceed her competitor's. 
Eventually as she runs against a vain man (Trump) her pragmatist ideas, her unfazed attitude to disregard vile rumors (as opposed to Trump who will respond -- remember short hands?) --- these mannerisms will shine through in Presidential debates which ultimately will impress people more than narratives, since seeing is believing for a lot of people.

If you recall, Romney plummeted hard after he made the ""binders full of women"" comment in the debates in 2012.

While Trump is not to be underestimated, I also think it is easy for Trump to inadvertently make such a blunder (his tirade against a Federal Judge for example) and lose support with vast majority of moderates and centrists fairly quickly. Trump is smarting under acting non-presidential since it gets him the 'angry right vote', but it may be the same that may be his undoing when contrasted with Hillary Clinton who is well-versed on how a leader of the most developed nation in the world should project and behave in terms of optics.

"I'll try and remember some of the stuff my teachers used to do, good and bad. (Stuff that worked, and stuff that made the kids say ""fuck you."") 

Stuff that worked? The board of education I already mentioned somewhere. It didn't ""scare"" kids, but it made them think this teacher was really awesome. Also his favorite food was bacon, that helped. 

One of my teachers wouldn't throw kids out of class. I guess he was either right out of college and didn't feel like dealing with troublesome kids, or was brilliant. If you didn't want to be there, you didn't have to. He'd let you just leave. Go to the cafeteria and get a coffee or something. (Yes, our school had coffee, it was awesome.) Then it's your fault when you fail all the tests and pop quizzes for not being there. 

I had an art teacher through elementary school who would do a raffle a day. Each of his classes had a jar with all their names on pieces of paper. If the class was good, at the end he'd pick a name (sometimes two or three) and give them prizes. It was either an eraser that actually worked, or he'd draw an awesome picture of a cartoon/video game character. Good incentive for a bunch of kids to behave.

All I can remember for now, I'll add more if I happen to remember any.

We had teachers when I was in elementary school who did the whole hand in the air thing. When they hold a hand up you're suppose to shut up. That never worked, I mean it did cause we were stupid little kids, but we all thought they were just as stupid for holding a hand in the air and that was suppose to mean something.

It is quite a challenge for us to know how many people adhere to a particular belief... and I don't know that it's important. 

Obviously if 5 people adhere to a belief, we won't do much with that. But if MAJOR denominations adhere to it, I'm not going to go ""well, there are 6.7 million protestants, but there are 34 million catholics and 12 million baptists who disagree... oh but wait... what about the lutherans, what do they think?

The bottom line is large numbers of people have wildly varying beliefs. About almost everything in the bible, save for maybe 5 or so synopsis ideas... 

I think most atheists do have a basic understanding of Christianity. But you can't expect them to be scholars on each individual denominations interpretations of every line of code. 

I know that some people don't believe there is a literal hell. I also know that some people think that non-believers don't go to hell, only evil people. I also know that some people think there is an actual, literal lake of fire.

> It's hardly a problem idea nowadays, as we usually wish people to know a field before speaking on it. Right?

That is quite different from sheep following a shepherd, both in imagery and in historical practice. A sheep is an unintelligent animal that just blindly obeys the shepherd. The shepherd directs the sheep at his whim, he is in a sense mentally dominating the sheep's minds. He also uses the sheep for wool and milk and eventually meat. I hope the analogy of this to indoctrination and getting tithes and often part of the inheritance money off human sheep leading to an obscenely wealthy Catholic church isn't lost on you.

> You seem to be mistaken. Homosexuality (as in gay sex, not the orientation itself) as natural or unnatural has zero to do with whether it appears in nature and in fact never has - this is a common misconception from people unaware of philosophy - but rather if it adheres to the natural ends of things. They work off of Natural Law, based in Greek thought.

That didn't seem to stop people from making arguments from unnaturalness in the past. Even if one accepts Greek philosophy (which is of course extremely outdated), what we learned about (homo)sexuality in the animal kingdom isn't without consequence because it shows that in addition to a reproductive function, sex also has a pair bonding function.

A more accurate term would be scientific consequentialism: the idea that what a moral action is determined by the effect of an action, and that we investigate those effects with evidence+reason. You see this popping up all over the world. Ex-Muslims and ex-Christians and (ex)-Jews usually have more or less the same morals whereas before they became ""ex"" they had different morals."

This is pretty much what I took exception to. Consider this scenario:

You find the people that are already donating to the point where they are making meaningful sacrifice and tell them they need to do more: since, after all, they are the ones that have demonstrated they have the most capacity for being helpful and self sacrificing.

How would that function? I run a PUG group and honestly, it just takes too much time to teach people everything they need to know to play 6v6. It takes a 45-60 min PUG cycle and basically doubles the time. The best thing to do is to just make teams and play. Use things like reddit.com/r/tf2lft and go make teams. There isn't really anything that you need to pick up that you can't learn from the average low level player on a 6s team. 

A tf2lobby based on new players would SUCK because:

1) New players don't know positioning

2) New players don't know calls

3) New players don't know rollouts or how to play mids.

How would that game go, and who the hell would even play it? We tried having 1 coach for 5 new players in the early days of the newbie mixes and it's impossible for a coach to teach 5 people during a game all where to stand and what to do. Honestly, my best advice for someone that can't make newbie mixes is to consider not playing competitive TF2 (It runs on a schedule, and if you can't play from 9PM to midnight EST roughly 4-5 nights a week, it might not be worth it to try), or to go and make friends on natf2, or reddit, or sleeping, or lobby or something. Go to the EXTV SOAP DM servers or Jump iT, or MGE servers and ask people that wanna coach you in 6v6. Go to natf2 and make a post under the mentor section. Do something. The competitive community isn't going to babysit and handhold because they are busy trying to win their own matches, not teach people things they can learn from casts or being on a UGC 6v6 team (which btw, takes literally no research to do, anyone can do it and you won't get miserably 5-0'd the whole time).

Gives a couple more of your examples and closes with a link to your post. He is basing that off your post, which is based off something you quoted by SEOP, which is based on wrong information. Its parroting. Its people who didn't come up with their own arguments but instead just link to yours like they are saying something.

That's you refuting those ideas that hardly anyone holds.

> Why are you telling me this?

I am claiming to be an atheist, specifically an agnostic atheist. You are free to refute that, or accept it. If you accept it, then I don't see any problem. However, the rest of the three posts that get linked seem to say that's not allowed, because it doesn't match your definition.

> of course don't think they're the exact same thing.

""This is like"" is what you said before that. You said they are like in comparison. So do you now claim the two examples (quoted below for comparison) are ""unlike"" each other? I claim they are unlike each other. If I was grading a middle school English paper and this was the example of a simile, it would get a red X on top of it.

> lacking belief that God exists with the idea of having a belief that God doesn't exist... this is like... either the belief that God exists or else the belief that left-handed people exist...

You said

> you aren't quoting from the comments of mine where I address the definition of 'atheism', but rather from incidental remarks in the preceding conversation.

Passage in question:

> the obfuscation here is rather transparent: although atheists in online apologetics want us to conflate the idea of lacking belief that God exists with the idea of having a belief that God doesn't exist, by giving us only a single word to refer to both, nearly all of them believe that God doesn't exist, so that tacking on the other meaning to the word they use to describe their believes does absolutely nothing but obscure what it is they believe

You continue this under the heading:

> PART ONE: DISPELLING MYTHS ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF 'ATHEISM' [subheading] Second Myth: That 'atheism' refers to the absence of a belief that God exists is just the correct definition of the word, as anyone who can read a dictionary knows. [Followed by this text] In fact, the vast majority of dictionaries use the ""positive atheism"" definition defended by the SEP and IEP. Here are examples: Dictionary.com, Merriam-Webster, Cambridge Dictionary, The Free Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary, Vocabulary.com, MacMillan Dictionary...

Seems like you continued with that thought into the definitions section and didn't negate the original statement. You are free to do so now if you don't want to claim it any more.

> The context of that remark is the case of the term 'atheism' being used to refer also to what is usually called agnosticism.

What do we call 10th century followers of Jesus? Christians. What would they be called today? Catholics. Christian is now an umbrella term. Atheist is the same, as it includes agnostics as well.

Then I mentioned the SEOP, which you use an example.

> What?

The only article on SEOP about atheism which I have ever read, is the article written by JCC 'Jack' Smart in the year 2000. I don't know what your ""what?"" question is in reference to. Is this the complete extent of your SEOP evidence? You mention SEOP, but don't go into detail about what specifically. I say that I disagree with him, most specifically because he starts the entire argument with what I consider a false definition: ""Atheism means the negation of theism, the denial of the existence of God."" It does not require the denial, but the lack of acceptance. He also admits that agnosticism wasn't coined by Huxley but only popularized by him. He thinks that no one should call themselves agnostic because we don't have to have 100% knowledge to believe something, but people might do so to fit in. He closes with ""these considerations are perhaps more a matter for sociologists than for philosophers"", admitting that he doesn't have the final say in it.
 
So, I have a few of questions for you. Even if you ignore the rest of this, at least answer these. From my understanding of your posts, you believe that using atheism to refer to both gnostic and agnostic varieties is a recent and willful obfuscation. My questions are as follows:

1. Is disbelief the same as an opposing belief, or the same as not having a belief?

1. Do words always mean the same thing as they did when they were first put into use; can definitions change over time?

1. Is an agnostic, by your understanding of the definition, a weak atheist?

1. Does atheism, by rule not example, propose a positive belief that no gods exist?

Depending upon your answers to these questions, we either completely disagree or we are in agreement on the important points and disagreement on the finer minutiae. "

He tried to finish 2 degrees and didn't.

He had no direction whatsoever.

He had no significant accomplishments to my standards.

I indeed look for equals. This is the minimum requirement. Actually, I like to look for partners who are more exceptional than myself.

We met on Tinder.

What you and my partner have in common when I met him and now: a certain spark, an interest, a curiosity about yourself. A desire to better yourself.

I don't see faces. This means I didn't use Tinder in a conventional way. I made a screening algorithm. I used the visual data to determine physical characteristics that are important to me not because of the superficial aspects, but because of what those things can indicate.

My partner had varied pictures, some that were taken by others. Only one of his face up close (which was a relief because I have facial blindness and immediately discounted candidates with more than one up close facial picture), one where he was having fun, one taken by someone else at a moment they seemed to find him ""beautiful"" that was more about taking a picture of his hands (his hands were strong and somehow elegant - my partner is a carpenter who plays piano beautifully).

His profile text was fun. Simple. Still I knew before I met him from this text he felt a certain amount of ""loneliness"". I was curious about the contradiction. 

When we chatted, he was very relaxed. Shy. Modest. When we met I was 10 minutes late because I was so nervous I had to pace for 10 minutes. We played chess. I immediately saw we were not equals in intelligence. However I liked the way his brain ""worked"". He was at an obvious disadvantage having played chess less than myself. Still I could see he had a brain that could visually apply itself in order to better implement aspects of game theory.

We went to my house and my dog liked him. She was always a good judge of character. He judged my dining table construction harshly. I saw he wasn't just a carpenter, he was someone who understood how to build things. How to improve upon things. He played ukele for me. I was right about the hands being elegant, but the way he constructs music was again, very intereresting.

I had flipped one of the digits of his age. He was 26 and not 29. I walked him back to his bicycle and thought we would never see each other again because I thought he wasn't physically attracted to me. 

I don't see faces, but when we were at the cafe, it became apparent that other people found him quite physically attractive and me not as in comparison.

I considered it likely based on this that he would not wish to interact with me again. 

We chatted and I told him we should hang out as friends. He liked me right away, but I can be stupid about picking up cues.

He recently said to me, ""I was good looking enough to attract girls who wanted to sleep with a good looking guy, but once they saw what I had to offer they would leave"".

I started seeing what he had to offer. 

We are equals in the way that matters more to me. We are both people who prefer ""fairness"". We are both people who believe respect is important. 

He is more exceptional than me.

"You know when the DK1 kickstarter first came to be, I backed the project because I thought it would be my best shot at getting anything close to what I was hoping for in terms of VR. With Carmack telling people that it was better than the VR that came before it, all I wanted was to get the headset so I can tinker with it and get it to run with Quake and Doom3. I had no idea that the whole VR thing would blow up this much and the thought of multiple competing VR gaming headsets and appstores didn't even enter my mind. This whole project has come such a long way since then, that I am not sure I even want Oculus to be the same company that they were when they started out. In order to survive they will have to think and plan according to the size of the market that they are attempting to satisfy. This has gone far beyond the MTBS3D forums.

"I had an abortion in April 2012. It was without a doubt the best thing I could've done in that situation. While I was pregnant I was absolutely miserable, I had morning sickness all the time and was super cranky. Around week 7 I went to the Planned. Parenthood. The people were really nice and asked if I wanted to talk about my options, but I was already sure and they didn't push me. The first day I had to do the ultrasound (not sure if that's how it is in every state) and the next day came back and got the first pill, Mifepristone. 24 hours after that one I took the Misoprostol. Since I got to do it in my own home it made me feel a lot better and I snuggled up on the couch and watched some Buffy! They give you pain pills to take before the Misoprostol, but I couldn't get mine (long story) so I had really bad cramps that probably would've been less painful with the pain pills. I felt completely fine after about 30 minutes. My boyfriend was very supportive of my decision and we are still together now! I hope things work out for you no matter what you choose. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk.

Edit: just read everyone else's comments. I know you're worried because it's a ""baby"", but if you're really only a couple weeks pregnant it like the size of a nut. A lot of women who have miscarriages at this point just think it's their periods. I hope I helped and didn't just make you more worried. I also hope your bf comes around once the shock wears off."

"I've used Scheme for an entire semester in college and I am fine with it.

Too bad anything I use in Scheme could be handled just as well lexically. By this I mean, anything I wanted to do in Scheme, I could have done in Python and it would have worked just as well. Why? Because I don't use variables that are defined in other functions unless it's explicitly part of a nested function. Anywhere you want the dynamic behavior would be better defined if you just passed the variable as a parameter but instead you define it and pass the scope.

And I assure you, I know how Scheme's scoping works. I didn't spend an entire lecture hearing about how frames are created, destroyed, linked to, and then repeating it on my midterm to just forget about it. But I just write it stuff that works the same regardless.

For instance, dynamic scoping allows:
x = 0
def f():
 print x
def g():
 x = 1
 print x
to print 1

I would rather it print 0. If it were written:
def g():
 def f():
 print x
 x = 1
 f()
then it would make perfect sense but it isn't.

But then, lets see how I would write this in scheme:
(define (g)
 (define (f) x)
 (define x 1)
 (f))

It's actually harder to find a use for dynamic scoping. I can't see why I would want to extend the scope at the time the function is called and not at the time I wrote it. "

A minority of self-described feminists aren't sexist and are just using the term naively because they're concerned about discrimination against women, but they're making a mistake by calling themselves a feminist.

"> First off, civil rights. I have them. Just because they're police officers doesn't mean I have to do what they ask me to do and I have every reason to question them, especially if they're detaining me. If you want to label that as being an uncooperative prick, fine. I'll live my life knowing I'm an intelligent being and not a dense sheep.

It's about your delivery, not what you're saying. You do have every right to question them, but it's in your own best interest to not be a dick about it. I feel like I shouldn't have to explain what this means to a grown man. Don't raise your voice, don't interrupt, be polite. Ask whatever questions you want, but listen to what they have to say, too. 

Also, the police do have every legal right to stop you and ask you off your bike just like they'd be allowed to ask you to step out of your vehicle. I'm sorry, you're just plain wrong about this. Look it up.

> No, I don't. That officer had been confrontational and intimidating from the moment he stepped out of his car. I'm not easily intimidated and I have no patience for that shit. That and because he was painting me as a criminal for carrying the knife and pepper spray is why I gave him his attitude right back. That isn't a crime and frankly, I'm a reasonable guy. If he had been reasonable with me, there wouldn't have been a problem.

If you know you've done nothing wrong then there's zero reason for you to become confrontational back. In fact, it's in your best interest to start recording any adverse police behavior and remain calm and polite throughout the entire interaction... especially if you want people to be on your side of the argument.

All I can see is what I see in the video, which stars off with the officer asking a simple question in what sounds like a reasonably polite tone and you responding with anger and defensive statements. Maybe he was a dick from the get-go maybe he wasn't... It's not illegal to be a dick to a cop, but it's certainly stupid.

> I was clarifying a few things and exerting my civil rights.

> Exactly. And that is the problem. It's called contempt of cop. He was being aggressive and intimidating. I didn't let him intimidate me, so he threw the book at me.

They did. Got a wreckless scofflaw like yourself to pony up the dough. I'm glad they cited you for riding unsafely without a proper sounding device. They should have cited you for riding with that boot on your foot too. Looks dangerous as fuck.

> I'm sorry, but ordering someone to get off their bike without clear cause, forcibly remove them when they ask why, remove legal weapons from them without cause

The police are legally permitted to do all of those things for their own safety, and it's up to their discretion. Did they give you your weapons back at the end of the stop? If so, they've done nothing wrong here. They're allowed to ask someone with a CCW to step away from their firearm for the duration of a traffic stop as well. They can take it, or ask you to step out of your vehicle. This is all legal and permissible and for the officer's safety. 

> That video does not show how I was treated when that officer first approached me and a good ten minutes that set the tone of that situation occurred before I got the genius idea to pull my phone out. When that video starts, they were JUST telling me why they pulled me over, which was explained by the other officer, not the mouthpiece that had been a dick from the start.

I can't possibly know if you're telling the truth here or not. If he was a dick from the get-go then obviously he was in the wrong. File a complaint with the department and show them your video of his 'misconduct' if you want. 

I actually know the police chief in the city... he was one of my criminal justice professors. I'll be sure to put in the good word for you. 

> I established that they were just doing their job

No, you sarcastically interrupted him and said 'yeah yeah you've got a report and you're just doing your job' then the officer threw it back at you. 

> when I asked if him I wasn't

Can you not hear yourself? You didn't 'ask him if you weren't' you spewed more sarcasm. 

> he started claiming that my hesitation was an attitude,

Your sarcasm was the attitude, not your hesitation.

> which I explained was because of his confrontational and intimidating demeanor, which he tried justifying on the account I had the knife and pepper spray

Police officers have a very stressful job. People with weapons who are being dismissive and don't seem to want to cooperate would be quite stressful. The officers had every right to stop and question you, I'd probably be short with you too. 

> Police officers should not be acting like this. Period. 

Nah, getting yelled at by the cops is deserved by many people. If they didn't physically abuse you I'd say you should just get over it.

> That is why I keep getting upvoted and you and the rest of the people trying to defend the officer are getting downvoted. 

No. That's because the hivemind hates cops.

> We all know that they shouldn't be acting like this. It's completely unprofessional, it's why there is such a distrust of law enforcement officers all over the country, and it's just ethically wrong to boot.

You're making this out to be way worse than it is. You got a ticket for doing something wrong. You did do that something wrong.... and you could have easily prevented that ticket. I'm 99% sure of it.

"Do we know if Tim was already working at the Institute when Jon hired him on as an assistant? Or did Jon pluck him straight from the publishing firm?

It was around the end of the semester when I walked into my Biology class, 10 minutes late, as usual. Everyone was standing around the tables and it was really, really quiet. The professor correctly guessed that I had forgotten the practical was that day, when she said ""I can set it up again for you tomorrow rushiku."" (protip: the professors are the ones you want to be friendly with)

I thought ""holy fuck, she shouldn't set all this up just for me"" and said ""nah, that's okay"", to which she replied ""are you sure? it's not really fair..."". It took me a moment to realize that she was talking about it not being fair for me after I'd assumed she'd meant it wasn't fair to the other students, I repeated ""no, it's okay, I'll take it now"".

When the results got back, I realized I should have studied - missed one.

Oh, oh! Same class. Now how old rushiku got so lucky, I can't tell you, but I'll be damned if I wasn't the only male in that room, well, other than the other dude, but he dropped after a week.

Anyway, we're identifying female reproductive organs and the like and my lab partners just aren't getting it.

> In short, when a city is “run on 100 percent renewable energy,” that’s an accounting reality, not a physical reality.

So the physical reality limits the ability of accounting to continue this way. That's what Roberts ignores. 

> When a city says it is getting 100 percent of its electricity from renewables, what it means is that it is buying a quantity of renewable energy equal to its energy consumption. Physically, it could not mean anything else.

Yes, physically it could mean something else. It could mean not only is the energy matched to the load but also the power. 

And lastly, Roberts doesn't even mention that cities making claims of 100% renewable almost always mean municipal load (police stations, stop lights, city hall) and not all load (homes, business, industry) within the city. 

Such a terrible post. He could have written a defense that headlines will never tell the full story, and while 100% renewable still means heavy reliance on fossil plants, these cities provide additional incentive for renewables (and he does mention that once). But instead he focusses on claiming laypeople will understand these technical nuances. "
"Right this second, perhaps. But it isn't indicative of what will happen at the next GE at all.

The problem I have with that analysis is the muddying of the water so to speak. For example, go on the Guardian now, if you look at the top headline it is ""Exclusive, Trotskyists twisting the arms of young members to back Corbyn, Watson says"".

Now, if there is anything I've learnt from speaking to younger people, it is those who support Corbyn do so because he represents a departure from the same as usual rubbish that the candidates in the previous labour election were offering, and now their choice is Corbyn, who they broadly supported or Owen Smith who is basically the same as the previous candidates except he is going ""I'm radical guys, I'm really left wing, trust me"", when the see-through fact of the matter is he is only saying that to garner support... his performance at the Leadership contest for example was abysmal. 

Unfortunately this barrage of propaganda will continue, and it has an effect on people... it is also dishonest and skews opinion, which is exactly what it is designed to do. So again, what the public generally think at the moment isn't a true reflection based on what has happened, but rather on the narrative that is being pushed. Will this continue and fool people until 2020? Who knows? It could be worse, it could be better... for me the problem with people (and many on this sub) is they pertain to know what is going to happen, when the reality is it is their own bias that is feeding that view, and what is happening in the media is further strengthening that bias, however incorrect or designed to push their own interests that reporting may be.

"> But what if I don't agree with the premise? Should I just leave the room?

You can argue against it. Nobody is claiming that 'x is my intuition' entails that 'x is true'. At best, intuitions are prima facie evidence, but they can always be defeated by an argument. As /u/AlexiusWyman is saying: if I cite my intuitions as evidence for x as a way of signalling I won't argue for x, you can (pretty obviously) always say something like 'well, that's where you're going astray! x is wrong, for reasons a, b, and c.' 

> This seems just a short step away from psychoanalyzing your opponent, which I've always considered rude. Why shouldn't I just ask them to justify their intuition? For person who doesn't share the intuition, an ""intuitive claim"" is just a claim taken out of thin air.

Not really. If my opponent says 'I have intuition x' and I want to do exactly what I outlined above --- namely, arguing that x is false, even though it is their intuition --- any argument against my opponent is often more convincing if I can explain why they thought x was true in the first place. It's not psychoanalyzing if I tell you what mistakes you made, etc. Every good teacher on Earth does that when correcting a student who has failed to grasp a lesson completely: we diagnose where the student has gone wrong in order to prevent future mistakes.

"Ah, a Keynesian I see. Disclosure; I'm not a believer in his economic theories.

So what you're saying is, if you're getting less short-term income than you used to, you should increase your long-term expenses in order to artificially return your short-term income to the place where it was? You can't see how that method only pushes the problem into the future?

Say you manage to get your tax revenues back to where they were after a while. OK, the downside is that now you have higher interest rates than before, because your loans are bigger, so the net gain is still less than it was. Here you might argue that your ""activating the economy"" has had positive effects on growth, so that the tax revenues actually are higher than before, evening everything out.

So what you've done here, in the best case scenario, is you've managed to maintain the status quo, but with the consequence of having higher debt than before, that is dependent on a yearly growth rate equal to or higher than the yearly interest rate (or you'd be forced to take even more new loans to maintain the economy). The next time a crisis hits, you'll be in the exact situation as you were before, only now with even more debt. If you want to see the end result of this kind of economic policy, look no further than current-day Greece. You're building a tower standing on a foundation that ultimately won't be able to support it.

While I am using some hyperbole to make my point here, the thing is, what makes sense for a firm or a household is exactly the same thing that makes sense for a government; that people are taught that this isn't true is the reason why people don't understand economics."

"> Just straight up vigilantism because someone CALLED this person a nazi or whatever. Not because they ARE a nazi, but because they were CALLED one.

I mean, I think vigilantism is wrong even if they're a nazi. Mob justice isn't real justice. I also hold very idealistic (possibly naive) views on punishment - I think that retribution should not factor into punishment at all, neither should deterrent (since that's not something that is actually going to help anyone after the crime is committed - it's just that at that point, you have to go through with the threat... but also because apparently deterrent doesn't mean anything to most people anyway). So I only really think that punishment should be for rehabilitation, and if there's no possibility of reform then they should be locked up, but only for safety, not for punishment. I think this should apply to anyone, even Hitler himself if he were still alive today. I've not had any of my relatives murdered though so I suppose it's easy for me to say that forgiveness is better than spite. 

But at the very least, I think that everyone should face the official justice system of their country. If someone (not a legal executioner, or soldier) kills a supposed Nazi or terrorist, then they are just as much a murderer whether or not the victim was innocent.

> It's pretty fucking disturbing.

Yeah, especially the dehumanisation. It's so blindly hypocritical, too! People saying ""terrorists are not humans"" forget that the reason that the terrorists can justify killing innocent civilians might be because they don't see us as human. Instead of trying to look for a solution, they just opt to continue the cycle of prejudice and hatred without thinking about what they're doing.

> even though I basically want to disagree with this, this is the most reasonable argument I've ever heard about not using that term, 

Thanks very much for considering what I was saying! And yeah, I'm not defending the people that actually do fit the label of SJW, but even then, if anything is going to change their minds, it's persuasion rather than outright hostility. So, if there is someone specific that you strongly disagree with, it's still better to approach them with the expectation that there's a chance they will listen to what you will say, even if that chance seems very small. 

Either that or give up on trying to change people's minds completely, and just ignore them - but arguing based on assumptions that you've made about them, or trying to force them to change their mind by berating them is just a waste of time and emotional effort. The only way I can see that strategy ever working is if you can make it so uncomfortable for them to keep believing in their own beliefs that they are forced to accept your own ideas... but... that tactic makes me feel very uneasy, since you'd basically be thought police at that point.

>> I think it is best to assume that everyone has the capacity to listen to reason

> However, I CAN argue with you on this. 

Eh, I stand by it. I'm not saying everyone will listen to reason, just that from a pragmatic POV, it's still usually better to assume that they will, even against all evidence to the contrary. If there's no chance in swaying their mind anyway then you won't gain anything, but you won't lose anything either.

(The downside I can see is that, following this, I might put far too much effort into trying to fight hopeless battles - and... yeah, I do get into some really pointless internet arguments even when I know for sure that I'm just going to get mass-downvoted for it, and I will persuade absolutely no one.)"
"Reddit is 90% children, who think the world should be simple and obvious

It doesn't work that way in real life"
"> Honestly, calling it neutral is laughable and one of the most intellectually dishonest things, I've ever read on reddit.

Whew, alright. I've been to Russia many times myself and have seen the country improve extremely well in the last 15 years, and I've also seen (heard) many journo's get shot, and corruption is extremely rampant in Russia. Those are things that cannot be denied. 

Both of those statements I just made (the improvement vs the corruption) are opposites in terms of Pro- and Anti-Putin. Yet, this doc shows both things, albeit they do tend to highlight the bad, that I agree with. But I expected it to be way more Anti-Putin, which is why I wrote 'surprisingly' in the title.

>There is no appreciation at all for the difference of the 'Russian soul.' Some cultures aren't democratic no matter how much Western cultural imperialist wish it were so. And this film acts like expanding NATO East wasn't a threat to Putin or Russia. Eastern Europe is the Russian sphere of influence, period.

Hmm, I don't know. It's true that Russia has never known true democracy, but I believe that all humans regardless of culture appreciate a free society over a non-free society, so I don't think Russians are simply 'fine' with their limits to personal and press-freedom, but are simply used to it, which does not make it any better, in my view.

"The Ideal Ego meets the Ego Ideal.

I'm struck by the hate (obviously a response to narcissistic wounding) in the comments at TLP's blog. They remind me of the NPC automatic comments to each comment I write. 

Because he's deified here, I'll need to show you how bad it was:

>So much of this blog reads like an isolated whiny male bitching about the world not gratifying his sensory and emotional needs and demands, much like a 2 year old... he is perpetually uncomfortable that people exist who think differently than him, with different priorities that have nothing to do with his. He's practically offended that people are seperate from himself.

It smells of the same spoon-fed critiques that I see written about me. 

Typically they will add: ""Why are you trying to copy his style? Why do you even post? You are just a whiny... (etc etc)""

What on earth makes it look I am copying him. I don't see it. It must be a projective identification on their part. They so desperately envy him and splatter their hate-love all over this board. 

The veneration of TLP with time gone by has converted their Ideal Ego (the idealized self-image of the subject). The collapse of the eat-your-vegetables Hilaryesque politics of morality forced a change on them. The shock at Trump, and the realisation that they are the bad guys has damaged even the Ideal-Ego itself. The frothing mouths and antifa violence establishes this. A dialectic of neuroticism is played out on this board.

But they write the snark for the Ego-Ideal: the agency whose gaze they try to impress with their ego image, the big Other who watches over them, the one they admire enough to want to watch over them, no matter what opinions they state to the contrary. They will always return. 

The Ego-Ideal was their NPC gender studies class, or civics class, but now its TLP himself. His silence provides transference space. They love him. They crave him. They want him to spank them. They want him to forgive them. They just want him to speak. 

But all they hear is the silence, the rustling of the leaves, the croaking frog and, in the distance, the Owl of Minerva waits for dusk to arrive."

"I think you're overstating the importance of advertising. Lots of us do not buy just because of the packaging or how the brand is positioned. We know that's just a load of marketing fluff.

I buy after I examine actual utility, reliability and performance. Even worse for marketers, I figure in used goods. Fully depreciated goods are almost always the best deal, even if you have to factor in a repair or two.

Big thanks to the Internet for making it easy to evaluate, find and purchase older products. For example, my razor is a 1959 Gillette. I would never buy a new Gillette. Today, Gillette is terrible and makes crap. Did you know that those $4 cartridges cost 5¢ or so to make?

"There is a lot that needs to be said, so I apologize in advance for the long post. 

Right before Kamille leaves Emma, he says what he always says as he sorties out of the Argama. Just a small little detail that doesn't really mean much, but just a nice touch. 

In the theatre we have a clash of ideals on how humanity should be guided. 

 Haman wants the revival of the Zabi family in order to forcibly dictate openly how humanity should evolve (Dictatorship where she controls through Mineva) 

 Papi wants to control humanity through the shadows. Something he's always been doing. He wants the select few elites to rule the world while he remains in the background manipulating them. (Humanity to arguably remain the same as it always has been, but with a change of actors where he is in power)

 I'm sure everyone knows Char's ideals by now. However, he again takes an interesting role in this ideals battle. Papi and Haman rightfully call Char out that he wants to personally move humanity in a certain direction just as much as they do, but Char doesn't openly say it. Char is perhaps yet again running away responsibility to make it happen, hiding behind the excuse that he wants no part in actually leading humanity when in reality he desires it just as much as they do. Char could very easily be the Newtype to guide other Newtypes and humanity but Char doesn't want to be that person. Instead he wants someone else to do it and make his ideals come true (in this case, it is Kamille). (Let the evolved humans (Newtype) lead humanity)

 Kamille in this battle of ideals says he's done with all this shit. Too many people have died in this struggle for power. Here we see what one of the clearest meanings behind the line ""Souls weighed down by gravity"". It means people who only see and think of the world in the ""old ways"" like Haman and Papi. 

It is an interesting idea to see how their ideologies differ on humanity's future. 

During the battle in the Colony Laser, Kamille is almost full on suicidal and staying behind to ensure that Hamann and Papi die along with him.

A very important line that Kamille says to keep in mind when talking to Char:

> You still have something left to do. In this war...! The people who have died in this war sacrificed their lives...believing the world would be saved as a result. I also believe in you!

Yes, Kamille just got mind fucked by Papi in his last moments. Kamille Bidan, for all intents and purposes, is dead. The Kamille Bidan we know from all 50 episodes of Zeta is gone, killed by Papi. His body may live, but his mind is forever lost. 

And now I'm going to give another perspective to try and make the ending a little less bitter. Kamille being mind fucked by Papi might just have been one of the best possible things to happen to Kamille. Why? Because Kamille was just given a clean slate. If we look at what was happening to Kamille, even before the final battle, Kamille was falling deeper and deeper into depression. The only thing which was still driving Kamille to continue forward was ending this war. Kamille had to witness almost all of his friends and loved ones die before him, something which was dialed up to 11 in the final battle. At that point he was becoming suicidal. We saw what happened with Amuro after the OYW. His life was not pleasant after he had accidently killed Lalah and it really took him 7 years to get over it. 

Now one has to ask, what would Kamille's life been like after the Gryps conflict? Truth be told it wasn't likely to be a very pleasant one. Kamille was already basically broken before it had even ended. Going back to my earlier statement on why what happened to Kamille was sort of a blessing in disguise, Kamille could forget everything that happened to him in this war. Kamille could forget seeing his mom and dad die before him. Kamille could forget seeing his first love sacrifice herself to save him. Kamille could forget killing Rosamia (And also ""Four"" with how he was projecting onto her). Kamille could forget seeing many of his close friends and loved ones die in front of him. Kamille wouldn't have to live with the horrors and tragedy of war.

Zeta Gundam is a show where people's pasts have come to really strongly dictate who they are and often what defines their actions. Char, Reccoa, Four, Rosamia, Katz etc. And here, Kamille was essentially freed from his past. 

Some minor notes to take care of:

 Char lives at the end of Zeta seeing as how the Hyaku Shiki survives the blast. He goes missing at the conclusion of the Gryps conflict.

 The Titans are completely wiped out. The majority of their fleet was destroyed by the Colony Laser and Papi is dead. This makes every major character involved with the Titans gone, with the exception of Yazan.

 The AEUG is basically devastated. It loss many of its key members (Kamille, Char, Emma, Henken) and the AEUG's fleet has been reduced down to two ships. I guess it is important to say this now so as to prevent future questions in ZZ. The entire Earth Sphere's forces were either in the Titans or AEUG/Karaba. After the incident when the Titans assassinated Blex, they gained a large amount of control over the standard Federation forces. Now this was never explicitly said, but it was partially implied that after Char's speech at Dakar many of the Earth Federation forces defected from the Titans to join up with the AEUG or Karaba on Earth. That's why in the final stretch of Zeta you can see the AEUG amassing a pretty sizeable fleet with a large amount of mobile suits, despite having lost a lot of its fleet and forces early in Zeta during the first drop down to Earth to attack Jaburo. Again this was never said outright, but it serves the purpose of increasing the significance of Char's speech as well as giving a much better explanation for the events to come in ZZ. 

 Finally, Haman and Axis get away with the least causalities in the Gryps conflict. This puts them as the strongest power left in the Earth Sphere. And if you recall correctly, Papi did say at the end of this conflict, a woman would be the leader of humanity. 

For those who are watching the BD EG release, there was a nice little touch at the end. 

Lastly, I leave you with the final song at the end, Conclusion."

"> what I'm saying is that is that you haven't shown anything saying it is permissible.

Again, I don't have to prove everything we are allowed to do is spelled out in the Bible and called permissible. Impermissable is not the default. In other words, we don't just call everything impermissible by default unless the Bible specifically calls it permissible. By such an ""impermissible by default"" standard, it is a sin to throw a ball because the Bible never says it is okay. It isn't my job to ""prove"" from the Bible that every single thing is okay. If you think something is sinful, it is your job to show where the Scriptures say it is a sin. And you've provided no Scriptures that say sexual pleasure before marriage is a sin. You're just making that rule up. 

> It's hypocritical to say everything I'm saying is based on my own assumption, but yours isn't.

No, I'm applying the same standard across the board: if we're going to say X is a sin, we have to show where the Bible indicate X is sinful. You're applying different standards across the board. For instance, you wouldn't say throwing a ball is sinful simply because the Bible never says its okay. Yet at the same time you're saying I have to prove where the Bible says sexual pleasure before marriage is okay. That's a double standard; that is hypocrisy.

> you haven't done a good enough job trying to convince me.

Some people simply refuse to be convinced. No amount of rational thought will convince those who are determined to maintain their position no matter how irrational. Having ears they don't hear, having eyes they don't see. 

>> For instance, prostitution often results in STDs and unplanned pregnancy with no stable family situation or even known family history.

> Sorta like sex outside of marriage...

No, sorta like promiscuity. Sexual pleasure before marriage doesn't necessarily have to be in the context of a promiscuous relationonship though. I've not said promiscuity is okay and indeed I believe it is a sin (Romans 13:13 says to avoid drunkeness and ""sexual promiscuity,"" NASB). What I've said is that sexual pleasure before marriage is not always necessarily sinful. Similarly, drinking alcohol doesn't always have to be in the context of drunkenness and addiction. Drinking alcohol isn't necessarily sinful, it can be sinful in some contexts but it isn't always sinful by default. 

If a couple is not being promiscuous, there is no higher chance of them contracting an STD than a married couple, no higher chance of an unplanned pregnancy than a married couple, and no chance at all of the family history not being known (the father not being known). So sexual pleasure before marriage doesn't necessarily lead to those things. 

> I'm saying it is referring to a sexual lust as sinful of a person

And you're just making that up out of nowhere too because the Scriptures never say it is sinful to greatly desire another person. ""Epithymeō,"" the Greek word for lust, simply means intense desire. There is nothing wrong with desiring your wife intensely or even your girlfriend in some situations. Indeed the Song of Solomon is a poetic celebration of a couples' intense desires for one another, both before and after their wedding. Indeed, hopefully spouses will desire one another with intense passion. There is nothing wrong with that, and the Bible never says there is. In context, Jesus was saying it is sinful to look at another person's wife with lust because he was talking about adultery and how it can occur in the heart. Looking at your own wife with intense desire is not adultery; God designed sex to be an intensely passionate experience. Intense desires are part of being sexual beings. 

> They then later on got married, didn't they? 

No. As I said, Judah and Tamar are never said to be married and are never referred to as husband and wife, not in the story, never in any geneolgoy... they simply had sex. That didn't make them married according to the scriptures. The Bible never states any rule that having sex equals being married. That too is your rule. You seem to have a habit of making up rules and pretending your rules are God's. 

> So then what is it to become one flesh and why does it need to avoided with a prostitute?

Becoming one flesh is having sex and it needs to be avoided with a prostitute because God said so. I don't know the mind of God so I can't tell you exactly why He has said everything He has. However, I can guess if you'd like. Again, as I already said, sex in the context of prostitution necessarily results in extremely high risk of STDs and unplanned pregnancy with no stable family situation or even known family history. That's not fair to the children involved. Promiscuity leads nowhere good, and prostitution is inherently promiscuous by its nature. It also often includes the victimization of women or in some cases of men. 

> It just doesn't make any sense.

It makes a lot of sense, actually

"> unconcerned with leaving the undocumented without relocation support

If you're so concerned with the undocumented as a group then shouldn't you want our city's vacancy rate to be higher so that apartments are less competitive to rent and therefore easier for those undocumented to get an apartment? The lower the vacancy the more it hurts those at the bottom that didn't win the affordable housing lottery?

The only fucking evidence people have of this Round earth and Gravity is in our history books and photo shopped pictures. I guarantee you that nobody has ever seen the round earth with their own eyes. 

Most people have been programmed to assume the Earth is round, because that is what school has told us since day one. The Round Earth theory is so ingrained in our programming that we don't even think it is worth questioning. Not to mention that if the Earth was flat then the implications would be very dark.

Whether or not the Tea Party can be argued to be more or less successful than the Occupy Wallstreet crowd is immaterial, the fact remains that in season two Occupy Wallstreet will be the focus simply because it's what happened.

>[T]hese stories allow the humans in this world to discuss things around the story, and yet when they do, no one stands up and has a real debate about anything. It's just people expressing their outrage or opinions on something and everyone nodding their heads.

I disagree. Do I wish there was more exposition on how exactly Will McAvoy is a conservative and how he champions those conservative solutions to issues he covers on the news? Absolutely! I think it's important to consider though that at this point in the series (only up to episode six for me) McAvoy is still somewhat reeling from feeling that his party has been taken over and so his focus has been on that and his television career and so we don't see much political conservatism from him in his ""off camera"" time.

I'm really expecting that to change in season two or I'll be very disappointed.

>There is nothing in this show to invite conservative people I know into the discussion. They are all told that they are part of the idiot party, and that they can't really argue against that because one of their own told them so.

Huh? No way! That's not the message I'm seeing at all!

The message I'm seeing is that the conservatives are being told their party has been invaded and hijacked, just like in the 60's the Democrats suffered something like that. I'm seeing a heroic attempt to shift public opinion by telling people the facts and showing them just how they're being treated like mushrooms.

Once season two kicks off I'd imagine we're going to see Will McAvoy cracking jokes to those who gave him a hard time about his sudden liberalism and asking them how they feel about the Occupy Wallstreet crowd. I expect to see his conservatism highlighted more then against the backdrop of the more radical and liberalized Occupy Movement.

How much institutional power do Muslim immigrants hold in your country that they're actually setting you back? What social institutions created to promote the equality of minorities have they undone since moving to your country? How many hate crimes do they commit compared to non-Muslims?

I feel like secularists tend to mis-characterize religion in really awful ways, particularly in portraying the faithful as incapable of independent thought and beholden to religious ideology. But people tend to project their personal views on their faith, not vice versa. Religion is a social construct; it reflects the ideas of the people who follow it, and is malleable on both the institutional and personal level. Change the people and you will change their religion."
"For the record, I cook all of my meals, which have ingredients purchased in bulk, and comprised mainly of proteins like beans, rice, quinoa, etcetera. I eat a salad for breakfast every morning. I also exercise everyday.

As far as the caloric intake argument goes, that is not true.

The idea is based on the law of thermodynamics. Total Change in Energy=Energy in - Energy out.

The idea is that The lower the change in energy number, the more likely you are to lose weight. So the variable that's easiest to manipulate is Energy in, by eating less.

Turns out, not the case with animals or humans. If energy in lowers, energy out will lower as the body tries to keep the total change in energy the same. The calorie argument is false and has been proven false since the 70s, but dietitians want to sell their patented diet plans and have pushed for this Change in Energy=Energy in - Energy out to be undeniable truth, it couldn't be further from the truth.

Now I will concede that if you eat horribly shitty foods, but exercise like Michael Phelps, you will probably not be fat, but most people don't have the time or discipline to do such a thing.

The fix I would offer to change the obesity epidemic would be to regulate the fast food industry and force them to sell healthier foods, as well as push for legislation that had better city planning so that poorer neighborhoods wouldn't get the short end of the stick when it comes to shopping for groceries and whatnot. I imagine if there were other policies where people could be rewarded for being healthy or some zany liberal shit like that I might consider supporting it as well.
Just telling people they're fucking lazy is not a fix. Leaving the system alone is not a fix either.
Obviously since obesity is increasing something has changed in the country. And I imagine it's probably not that laziness has gone up.

As a sidenote. We don't know everything that makes us fat. Anyone who claims to is lying."

"Then I still do not understand the effects of this supposed privilege (not being flippant). It appears you argue that it has nothing to do with gaining actual advantage. Is it just within the same vein as the ""male gaze"" theory? That it's disadvantageous to society to have a primarily male uh...shadow? to it's political and economic design? 

As your example, Citizens united, you could state that there is a ""coporate privilege, no? But doesn't that ignore that the corporation answers to a board, who answers to stock owners, who answer to their families need for food on the table, who answers to farmers, etc etc.

Furthermore it is in my experience (I enjoy foucault) that power is not imposed from one person to another, but is an ""Agreed"" relationship, even if that relationship comes about by means of 'spontaneous' consent.

Power is not represented by arrows, power is represented by a net."

"> ""2% of men are rapists"" is a biased statistic.

I don't think you know what that term means, because no, it's not.

> It assumes that being male is the only factor that causes people to be rapists

No, it doesn't. No one who has ever taken statistics would be under the impression that any given statistic constitutes a claim that only the variable the statistic refers to is causally relevant. I would caution you against just writing random notions you've come up with about how statistics work, because you haven't been correct yet. 

> but to assume that any individual black man is likely to be a criminal is racist

Yes, generalizing statistics, a statement about group behaviors and tendencies, to make assumptions about a specific individual is fallacious.

> Likewise, to assume that any relatively small group of males contains a rapist is sexist.

And here it falls apart yet again. No. Statistics are statements about groups. The previous example was correct because you were taking a group tool and applying it to a specific individual. However, you then tried to use that trivial observation to make the jump that a group tool cannot validly be applied to groups, an absolutely ridiculous notion that again displays that you don't really have any background with statistics. I don't mean that as an offense either, but understanding the topic does actually matter if you're gonna try to go around making claims about it.

It is trivially true that in a group of 50, if 2% are expected to be something, then you can assume with high certainty that 1 member is that something."

"Difference is that Scarecrow was already introduced in a previous film where he was basically a henchman for Al Ghul. Thus we see him in TDK for the sake of continuity, but doesn't affect the big picture of the film as a whole, thus not distracting it.

The Rhino was a pointless addition only to have Spider-Man defeat him, and then save him for the end of the film for a battle we never see. He's wasted. He distracts the film and is wasted.

Electro was supposed to be the main villain, but he was weak. His motivations to hate Spider-Man were purely out of rage, but even then it's stupid how he suddenly turns on Spider-Man. Harry's is stupid as well. His dad dies at an old age, and Harry is like what, 20? He could wait and take time to find a cure. He could have said ""Spider-Man I ain't a dunce, we'll test your blood so it can be safe for me. I own a billion dollar science company anyways."" But he was a dunce, because he never even considered his resources.

The motives in TASM are paper-thin. Meanwhile, the Dark Knight has motives that are far more stronger. For the majority of the film, Harvey Dent is a hero, a guy trying to do the right thing. Through that pursuit, he gets hurt, and finally cracks, destroying everything he did that helped the city because he lost faith in it.

The Joker, however, has unknown motives. And we're not supposed to know them. He's a face of evil we can't understand, and we're not supposed to. He just burns everything and continues to do so because he seems to enjoy the chaos. I guess you could argue it's ""paper thin"" but it's far more complex than anything TASM2 has to offer. It also keeps the conflict interesting because our heroes are afraid of him; they don't know his next move.

That's probably why the film did so much better. They didn't focus on how many villains they could stuff in and trying to team them up in The Dark Knight so they could make a Villain Team Up film later. Nolan just wanted to tell a deep story, and with that, he succeeded."
"As others have noted, each child is vastly different. That said, some general rules would be:

Treat him as you would a normal child, outside of knowing about sensory overload and giving him 'space'
Be patient, and smile and talk softly. He sees and hears this and it adds to his comfort zone even if you don't think he does.
Rub his back if he is stressed. Most ASD kids are stressed by sensory overload and relaxed by small touches. 
Don't yell. Explain right and wrong as you would a much younger child. The world is a scary place and he sees it through a very different lens, generally.
Give lot's of love. Hugs, positive feedback, and high fives can turn a very introverted and angry child into a happy one progressing towards mainstreaming and an easier life.
If you can give your girlfriend a break and take him to play basketball or just chase him for a few hours, that'll work wonder's for her. Autistic kids are by and large big loves and wonderful, but break's are a very good thing and the child is not the only one who can get overwhelmed.

"> So if we ignore everything which ultimately boils down to ""personal bias"" what are we left with? I'd argue nothing. That's the core of why I'd argue we shouldn't say pantheism is guilty of equivocation or else we'd have to levy the same charge against all forms theism. There simply exists no objective base to build a definition of god on. The definition of god must be included in a premise. It can't be assumed.

However, there's a difference between personal bias that constructs an answer to questions out of fantasy and a personal bias that attempts to conflate that answer with a concrete concept we already have.

""What is God?""

""We don't know. Therefore God is my sock. All hail the Sock God!""

That's equivocation. In order to resolve the problem of not having a coherent definition for a god, we attempt to tie it to something unrelated that does have a coherent definition.

> But I would argue religions like Judaism and deism/classical theism are the most coherent forms of theism (not necessarily true, but far more coherent than asking a random stranger off the street to define god). Why should we count out the most coherent simply because it's not the most popular? Isn't that an appeal to popularity?

What is language but an appeal to popularity? We use words to attempt to convey ideas. The more concrete the idea the more precise our language tends to become. Judaism and other classical forms of theism posit concrete ideas of gods and mysticism, but are hindered by reality's refusal to provide demonstrable support for those ideas. So the language gets confused as we try to discuss something that we have no common experience over and variations in ideas spring up everywhere.

Pantheism is different in that it attempts to resolve this confusion by replacing ""god"" with ""universe"" even though the concept of ""universe"" is already sufficiently concrete that it doesn't need it and the addition only serves to confuse both.

> Quick side note, but this isn't true. :) The Bohr-Einstein debates are excellent examples of some of the quite emotionally strong disagreements which can ultimately be considered definitional and of a descriptive nature of reality. The very need and subsequent disagreement of QM interpretations is another great example. M-theory with its mind boggling S/T-duality and associated physical implications are a third.

As I said before, those are details. ;) The foundational concept is concrete is non-controversial; it's only when we start exploring how and why things are the way they are that we start seeing emotional investment. Because, unsurprisingly, we don't yet have concrete answers for everything. The debate begins at the same place where we find confusion.

> I don't know what an ""accident of physics"" is. Expectation is built up from understanding of necessary (or rather ultimately probabilistic) outcomes and an ""accident"" implies some derivation from the expected which would point to a lack of understanding on our part but not a unexpected consequence from the view point of Laplace's demon.

Speaking as a reformed creationist, I'm borrowing from a creationists' misunderstanding of how physics and cosmology work. ""How can the universe just be an accident?""

> But to your point that their concept implies god as a deliberate actor I don't think is true either. The question of whether god could be anything other than god and change his own nature isn't a broadly agreed upon. Look at the disagreement amongst Jews.

The creation myths and scriptures suggest otherwise. Again, confusion in the details but the core principles are fairly concrete.

> Sorry if I'm coming off as confrontational. That's not my point. Rather, I don't believe that there exists any objective ultimate definition of what god is. There are popular understandings but those popular understands aren't deep enough for us to consider them meaningful. So instead we're left with an empty concept which, should we choose to argue for its existence, we would need to define first. Thus, pantheism with its definition isn't guilty of equivocation. It's just simply pointless.

I don't perceive you being confrontational, just arguing your point. Please continue to do so. :)

So writers do that, they give Kara and other characters on these shows friends, and what does the Tumblr fandom do? Say they're gay and start making fanfic of them longingly looking at each other and photoshopping them together in pictures.

"Partially, yes. I came to this field through philosophy of mathematics, but in this case my example struck past the mark and I ended up confusing you and myself, my apologies. Mathematics have a weird status in modern science. Keep asking questions to a scientist, and you'll find a metaphysics that usually isn't too awful; it's often materialist with an intuitive knowledge of whatever philosophy of science is prominent in their field. Ask them ""so what's mathematics?"" and suddenly, there's a gap. It's not much of a problem in the social sciences, but for the physicist, there's this incredibly useful tool he uses all the time, but he won't usually able to put a finger on it. ""It's like language"" ""It's symbols"" - but then how is it so useful at such a detailed level of physics? The irony here is that most mathematicians abide by some sort of realism - they feel that they're discovering truths, not constructing them. Hell, constructivist mathematics are rather different from the normal variety. I'm meandering though, and confusing the issue even more. I'm sorry.

My point should perhaps be surmised thus: trying to give mathematics its proper status while adhering to materialism is a difficulty. Mathematical realism is no option - if only matter exists, then numbers cannot exist by themselves, ""behind"" the reality we perceive, so to speak. That puts a serious dent in the intuition of the physicist as ""uncovering"" the way the universe, works though - and it's that very intuition that's a centrepiece of materialism, the idea that the physicist is discovering the matter at heart, of which everything else is made.

But it's easy to give up on materialism and solve the issue. For example, the Aristotelian route: Mathematics is an abstraction of reality, and reality itself is ultimately beyond our knowledge except through abstractions. Voila, all of science still works, but we have to let go of physicalism nonetheless."

Edit: to add something more relevant to the discussion, it's not immediately clear to me that quenching the superconductivity with such high magnetic fields does not push the system away from the interesting phase that is relevant to superconductivity. The implication of such oscillations, to my understanding, is that the normal state of the cuprates is just a Fermi liquid, and all the rest of the phases (pseudogap/SC/strange metal) are all built upon a Fermi liquid.

Seeing this whole ""make fun if hipsters"" trend develop over the last couple years has gotten really annoying.

"""Queen Bee syndrome"" and ""I-hate-other-girls drama queen"" are great examples of toxic femininity and are often discussed and nearly universally condemned by feminists. Granted, they tend to portray it as those women themselves being victims of misogyny and channeling it, aka ""internalising"" it, but they actually portray toxic masculinity the same way. ""Toxic masculinity"" doesn't mean ""men are evil"", it means men can also fall victim to negative gender roles just like women do and they need help.

I don't think I will ever understand this passionate MRM hatred for ""toxic masculinity"" term. The funniest thing is that this term was originally coined by MRAs, to express the very same idea that feminists use too - how gender roles harm men and make some men cause harm to society in general as a result of gendered expectations brought to extreme. I could understand being against the term because ""toxic femininity"" is rarely used, but not agains the term itself if it expressed exactly the same ideas many MRAs believe in too."

Causing several unnamed annoyances is literally nothing in my book. People deal with this everyday. I had to smell my colleagues fart and MacDonalds was out of ice cream today. We survive regardless.

I'm saying I don't think they're certainly annoyed. At most it's been described as ""weird"". And even if they are annoyed, annoyance isn't the end of the world. 

POSSIBLE AND LIKELY hurt girls with only themselves to blame will still be LIKELY hurt regardless of the strategy applied, as they are. 

The POSSIBLE AND UNLIKELY spared ones are of a higher number because they were given the chance to act upon the reinstatement and did. 

The women's abundance mentality minimises the impact of this disappointment.

Magical thinking irks me considerably. Obviously any misinformed opinion will rub me up the wrong way, vaccination causing autism comes to mind. Magical thinking, however, is quite prevalent nowadays. It hides itself under this guise of open mindedness which makes its followers difficult to tolerate.

I find beliefs unacceptable if nobody can convince me they are arguable.

For instance, libertarianism, I think, is a flawed political philosophy. Crucially though it has its defences and ultimately there is no way to know how well it could be utilised. I will gladly talk about ideas in those realms, with respect and tolerance. Everyone has their opinions on the unknown. It is fun to argue about them as long as everyone admits nobody knows.

Goku is saying that if Frieza was a better fighter, if he had more strength, if he developed his powers more, he would have won. There is no reference to a time limit. 

The episode never says that being in the form and doing nothing drained on Frieza's stamina, you explained a lot of extraneous detailed I showed I already knew, that Frieza could not sustain the higher functions of his new form, but that means nothing about his overall strength being greater or that he would have lost more energy if he wasn't fighting.

"> Also of relevance (and extremely so imho), Sam wasn't making an argument for a Carson presidency (he was absolutely brutal in his criticism of Carson in that very segment), he was making a purely hypothetical and deliberately extreme example to show how utterly wrong Chomsky is, in his opinion, regarding this one specific issue.
> 

Right, and thus stating that someone whose views many consider...unhelpful and motivating unconstitutional policies is preferable. 

And thus people are free to say ""well...you're wrong'

If someone held that the local authoritarian party was preferable to most mainstream parties on certain issues, one is totally free to consider that a sign of worrying priorities.

It's not a given of course, but it's not unreasonable for someone to argue their way there.

>All criticisms of this argument I've come across (not discounting those that I haven't), are basically and in simplified form one of these two (leaving aside the useless ad homs and spurious insults which very likely form the majority of critical responses):
""You can't prefer Carson in conditions x, y, z.""
""Chomsky is extra special, Sam's choice is thus invalid.""
I hope I don't have to explain why both of this rebuttals don't achieve much against Sam's argument. Btw your opening here mostly falls under 2, you then start flirting with 1 (but read on).

That's not simplified, it's just uncharitable. 

What does ""Chomsky is extra special"" even mean? A charitable framing may have been ""Harris' position on Chomsky is not well argued, that Chomsky does indeed know there's a problem of Jihad and is thus preferable to Carson"" or something of the sort. 

I mean, you recognize that the substance of the person's positions actually matter, that's why I can't slide Maajid Nawaz in there and say ""I prefer Ben Carson to Maajid Nawaz"". So someone can thus argue that, on the substance of his position, you cannot slide Chomsky in there. It has nothing to do with being 'special' in some transcendent way. 

 
Of course, even for 1 you can try to deflate the conditions as approaching any reality meaningful to us and so on. There are ways of deflating arguments. But we seem to have gotten focused most on 2. 
>Sure, this is always possible, but being a matter of opinion it can't but remain arguable.

Everything is arguable here!.

I don't understand this weird sort of almost logical positivist split where people think they can talk about some abstract logical structure without actually the the actual premises and real-world facts that lead people to dislike Harris' comment. 

Sam's entire argument rests on Chomsky having certain views, Carson having certain views and the world being a certain way. You might frame all of that as a matter of opinion, I will say that it's all arguable. 

It is in fact the main thing, the interesting thing.

Trying to frame people are arguing off fallacies while avoiding the actual ""arguable"" parts strikes me as a bit of a pointless exercise.

Trying to see if Harris' argument works on an abstract level is just pointless. I can set up a comparison between David Cameron and Hitler, argue that David Cameron is worse in X scenario and then retreat to a more abstract view of how someone like David Cameron could potentially be worse than someone like Hitler. It could be defensible. But it's not the point. 

>That's a bit of a straw man. No one of relevance is saying Chomsky doesn't believe there's a problem. Their point is Chomsky doesn't agree there is the specific problem of global jihadism stemming from religious indoctrination/doctrine, because he lays (nearly) all the blame at the feet of USFP. 

>Given a choice between Noam Chomsky and Ben Carson, in terms of the totality of their understanding of what’s happening now in the world, I’d vote for Ben Carson every time. Ben Carson is a dangerously deluded religious imbecile[.] [...] [T]he fact that he is a candidate for president is a scandal[,] [...] but at the very least he can be counted on to sort of get this one right. He understands that jihadists are the enemy.


No one forced Harris to say stuff like this did they? 

>Which I personally do think is quite a fair point, because in everything I read or watch of his, he brings it back to that. He might occasionally concede a minor point or two about extremists, but he'll be quick to pivot back to USFP, which I think can't be argued isn't his absolute main focus, even explicitly so.

Yes, and we've had multiple discussions on why this is the case and why his philosophy -cause it is a philosophical position- on this is not insane. 

And I don't think it justifies the sort of language and framing above.

>but it still doesn't resolve much, as it keeps each one on their own side.

I don't see what that means? Sam made a claim, someone rejects the claim. Why is it their fault that people are ""on their own side""? 

After all, they are not the genesis of what Sam surely knew to be an attention-grabbing and divisive statement. 

Is the onus on them to somehow meet Sam and agree with him to resolve this divide? Can someone just not make a claim people consider to be wrong?

Why? They both support my argument. Ultimately, Hamilton is concerned about a certain, unfit type of person becoming president, and wanted electors to make sure that doesn't happen since he didn't trust the people. He also said the president should be chosen by;
""by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice.”

Because commoners did not have the capabilities to analyze the qualities adapted to the station...

It's pretty well known Hamilton didn't care much for common people. He was a friend of aristocrats through and through.

>What's obvious is that the concern about the common people was justified.
Alexander Hamilton (yes...the same individual you quoted) supported the Electoral College because deciding the President on just the popular vote would be detrimental.

Hamilton thought the popular vote was detrimental because the people aren't qualified to select a president. Thanks, you've supported my point. 

>No...You haven't. You've posted part of a quote here & there (to which I provided the full quote) and just keep saying it's undemocratic.

> You think maybe that's so rare because they know there'd be violent consequences?

No. It's so rare because people by their nature avoid confrontation, unless provoked. Violent consequences are never a deterrent. There have been many studies backing up the claim that neither imprisonment nor capital punishment deter crime, I am too lazy to go look it all up, but if you insist, I can try to find some later.

> So is your argument that an anarchistic society wouldn't need violent protections for individuals? Explain to me how one would be protected.

Do you really believe you are protected under state rule? How so? Does the state provide you a bodyguard and a lawyer? I protect myself, my family, and my property against other people's encroachment myself. The only time I get state involved is because of bureaucracy involved if violence was used as CYA.

> As far as I can tell, the only difference between anarchy and having a government is whether or not there's a monopoly on violence.

There is a logical inconsistency in above statement: the assumption that without state a society is inherently violent, also assuming that the law is the main deterrent of violence, which in turn suggests that without said law people would just randomly go and rob, cheat, and kill. Guess what — the law has never stopped anyone from robbing, cheating, stealing, and killing.

Now, the second thing is the assumption that the state and its government aka bureaucracy somehow has its subjects' interests as one of its objectives, which is completely false as any bureaucracy's goal is to feed itself, bloat, and protect its own interests using the letter of the law as the justification for its existence.

Finally, having lived as long as I lived, I realize that absence of state is an idealistic belief and it isn't possible just because people will never want this ""freedom"", it seems to be inherent, maybe genetic, I don't know, hence such vehement defense of their masters, whoever they are, and desire to conform to some norm or standard."

Anyway, back on point. Sure, there are always going to be classes that are more powerful than others. So why is that? Well, because they have better cards, that’s why. There is absolutely no excuse in my book for an entire class to be trash tier. For example, shaman before the patches/Creeper nerfs. Absolutely unplayable class. The simple reason for this is that near enough all shaman class cards in the last 2 xpacs were trash. Can you explain why Blizzard made these cards so bad? There is no reason for it. Just poor design. Perhaps because Shaman had been OP for 1-2 years with Trogg etc. Let’s compare the Shaman cards to the Warlock cards. Warlock received a set of cards that were quite clearly designed to fit a specific deck (cube/control). And yet Shaman cards from the same xpac have next to no synergy and have thus seen very little play. Shaman is still pretty naff. And your reason for this is that, well, it’s impossible to balance the cards. Sorry, that doesn’t fly with me I’m afraid. Yes, I understand making all 9 classes equal is pretty much impossible, but there should never be a situation when one class is so dumpster it doesn’t see play at all. If you think that’s because it’s impossible to design, I’m afraid you need to open your mind. No one ever got anywhere believing anything was impossible. 

Also, saying that all cards being good makes all cards bad is kind of a moot point isn’t it? If all cards are bad then aren’t all cards also good?

"> Says it's subjective, then brings up an anecdote.

Do you know what subjective means? It means it varies from person to person, so an anecdote is how you can demonstrate that.

>It's not subjective

Again, I think you need a dictionary. How big is ""too big"" is absolutely subjective.

>the XDS and Shield are significantly smaller and lighter with the same capacity. 

They're also significantly harder to shoot well. Its his first pistol. If he's going to carry it, he needs to practice and become proficient. The P239 is going to be more conducive to lots of good practice. And for plenty of people, its still eminently concealable.

These are you opinions. Stop acting like they're facts.

>I mean saying 'Well my girlfriend who isn't a firearms expert and has only owned one gun likes that one gun' doesn't really stand as evidence.

I was giving that example to show ""too big"" is subjective. You say its too big, a small-ish girl I know says its just right. That means its subjective.

>I've always only owned one handgun. I just sell the one I used to have for the new one, but I've carried the Shield for a while and have no intention to get another pistol.

"This is exactly the sort of shit I'm talking about. 

Hand-wringing over tone as if it was tone that prevents people from accepting established science or showing an iota of critical thought. 

The vast majority of people simply cannot be reasoned with, and where reason fails ridicule and social pressure need to be employed.

You show a profound ignorance of the history of freethought and how social change occurs in general.

Atheists are more accepted today than in the past, and it isn't because we've been quiet and polite. It's due to aggressively putting the position out there and demanding a place at the table. Being polite got us absolutely nowhere with the powers that be or with society's general perception of us, because when you are polite, when you are meek you get run over, forgotten and marginalized.

You can see strong parallels with any minority gaining acceptance in a society that is hostile to them. The LGBT community isn't on the cusp of gaining marriage equality because they were polite. They are successful, because they have managed to stigmatize being a homophobe. And that's what we need to do - make it socially unacceptable to believe in woo or deny established science. You don't accomplish that without a few dicks, without ridicule.

It's been established that politely trying to educate your audience is very ineffective, and may even backfire and reinforce the belief or behavior you are trying to change. 

Ridicule, sarcasm, shame, mockery, exclusion and criticism are how humans establish and reinforce all social norms - in psychology it is called informal social control. This is how socialization works. Short of having a government enforce such things through force, that is what we have to work with and it is profoundly naive to pretend otherwise.

"Okay, preface: I do not think the bible is a sex ed book. Sex ed is incredibly important, and students need to learn about contraception. Morally, I think premarital sex is wrong, but I have to acknowledge that not everyone shares my beliefs. Those who are going to engage in premarital sex need to know how to do so without spreading disease or getting pregnant, and those who are only going to have sex while married still need to know how sex works.

Just so we're clear that I'm not endorsing the ""The Bible is all the 'sex ed' we need view"".

This post and this thread show ignorance on your part. What you guys are doing in this thread (specifically here) is the equivalent of reading a small excerpt of Animal Farm, interpreting it 100% literally, and then laughing at the result. Sure, it might be kind of funny, but it also shows that you don't really know what you're talking about.

Let's look at this with context included.

Most importantly, Ezekiel 23:4:

>4\. The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.

So, right there, the Lord (who is ostensibly narrating here) tells the reader that this is symbolic. This story shouldn't be taken literally, but as a metaphor.

Let's look at a few more verses:

>11\. Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister.

>12\. She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men.

>13\. I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way.

So, Oholibah (the woman symbolic of Jerusalem) defiled herself by lusting after the Assyrians. What this means is that Jerusalem (and more importantly the people living in Jersusalem) defiled themselves by associating with the Assyrians. More specifically (as shown later on), they sacrificed to idols. That's very, very bad.

Next.

>18\. When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister.

> 19\. Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt.

>20\. There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.

So, Jerusalem carried on this sinful idol worship in open and exposed their sin. The Lord turned away from Jerusalem in disgust. As Jerusalem became more corrupt, she remembers the whoredoms of her youth in Egypt (referring to the people of Jerusalem idol-worshipping in Egypt).

The rest of the chapter (which this delightful individual expounds on) talks about the punishments Jerusalem will face for being so wicked. Metaphorically.

We're not talking about an actual woman here.

Many highly-voted comments in this thread have been of people taking one or two lines of the bible, ignoring all context, quoting it, and laughing about it being funny. That's the intellectual equivalent of fundies who say ""If monkeys turned into humans, why do we still have monkeys?"" What I'm saying is that it's intellectually lazy to pull shit like this. There's plenty of stuff in the bible that's weird or ridiculous even after you consider the context; it's not like you need to resort to this if you want to mock the bible.

"he made his subreddit because he got banned here, not the other way around. All he did was delete some threads that probably should've been deleted anyway. If even that, because nobody has been able to actually provide any proof of that.

But let's talk antagonistic behavior: after feeding off of csgolounge.com for a good couple months the admins of this subreddit put up and sticky a thread inviting people to hate on /u/yaroberto and csgolounge as much as they please. Do note the wording in the OP.

Then when it gets out of hand (how could it not?) with people posting the guy's phone number and stuff the mods refuse to act. I had to call in reddit's main admins to get the stuff removed (after like 7 hours).

But yeah, making judgment calls to the best of someone's ability (/u/yaroberto on the day's matches) makes people antagonistic. Invoking and condoning witchhunts is totally cool.

I know everybody here loves /u/Coca_Cola_PR, but the truth of the matter is the dude messed up, saw what he did and then chickened out. The fact that nobody else on the Mod-team jumped in where he maybe had a bad episode doesn't do a lot to restore faith in this subreddit.

The fact that up until as I write this no remaining Mods have distanced themselves from /u/Coca_Cola_PR's behavior on that day or have even tried beginning to right his wrongs is just bad moderation. Just bad moderation.

Unbanning /u/yaroberto really is the tiniest step imaginable in starting to repair the damage done. I honestly can't believe THAT's what we're debating here. We should be talking about what we can do to make amends with csgolounge. Can you even begin to imagine what /u/yaroberto must think of this subreddit?

If you honestly think /u/yaroberto is the bad guy here all I can say is maybe get that shoulder looked at, because there seems to be a huge chip on it. The guy sucks at communicating, but at least he has always had the community's best interest at heart.

/u/Coca_Cola_PR at least came to his senses at one point. I respect him for that. But refusing to right his wrongs is not the way to honor all his time spent on building this community.

You can delete threads addressing this, you can downvote me all you want, you can even go on pretending none of this ever happened. In that case I guess we'll find eachother again in two months over at /r/csgobet with me telling you I told you so.

Or you can take a deep breath, put on your big boy pants and start actually dealing with the situation at hand. Apologizing to and unbanning /u/yaroberto is the obvious first step and doesn't even begin to cover what this subreddit and the csgo community as a whole owes the guy."

"OK, by ""hard"" polytheism I mean the curious insistence on the ""individuality"" of gods and some related notions. I am opposing it to animism. I know very little about archetypes or Jung.

Mythology is a good thing precisely because it can accommodate variation and differences. Mythology is stories, and there can be multiple ""disagreeing"" stories, and it's not a problem, because mythology is meant to be understood, not believed.

The problem with theology is that is says X is true and therefore not-X is false. This means it contradicts other theologies, and since it's all just based on feels anyway, it eventually leads to cognitive dissonance when the feels change. That's unhealthy, in my view. Mythology is also all just based on feels, ultimately, but that's not a problem because it's just telling stories rather than making definitive statements.

I don't substantiate any belief in the gods. I simply recognise their presence in the world. Different people and different cultures have similar and different experiences, and since it's all experiences and behaviours and stories and mythologies, there's never any contradiction, as there is with beliefs and theologies."
"(Part 2)

Now, with that framework... onto what I have observed personally, in my relationship and my life.

> See, while people like you see very little going on worth noticing in day to day interactions, there is sometimes more than meets the eye.

No real gripe here, it just kind of offends me because I am fascinated with human sexuality and psychology and I am constantly observing what I can about every day interactions and especially what's going on in my own relationship to keep it healthy. I am very, very cognizant of the dynamics and push/pull of my relationship especially, and passingly cognizant of day to day life exchanges. 

Anyway.

>So, back to the new example you brought up... when he belittled you and you reacted, and he acquiesced, what was the net change in hierarchy? Do you think you passed that shit-test? 

and 

>So... back to why I said no; I think you should have ignored his shit-test.

All right, so, interpersonal relationships aren't just about the circumplex. RP likes to basically say that good relationships are completely dependent on people being in their proper squares. That is not true.

Here is what was actually happening, and it's actually really damn piddling because honestly don't have many conflicts: we both play Magic the Gathering a lot, but he is infinitely better than I. I have some self esteem issues (as everyone does) and this made me feel kinda bad, so I would be a lot more quick to point out his mistakes while he was playing than usual to make myself better, and I did it in a much more snappy manner than was necessary... to raise my self esteem. To soothe that little ache you get in your chest when you feel worse than someone at something.

It had nothing to do with getting him to be submissive or dominant or whatever, it was completely centered on me and making me feel better. I didn't care if he responded by saying ""Oh, yeah, you're right... sorry"" or ""Yeah, everyone makes mistakes, like you did a couple minutes ago :p"" (negative or dominant, respectively). He pointed it out to me, said it hurt him, I did some introspection and realized that's why I was doing it. I told him, and he quickly assured me, soothed my self esteem and my ego with soft words and cuddles and happiness.

It was not a dominance struggle. He went from negative dominant when he was criticizing me for my behavior, to positive submissive when I took over the conversation and explained to him what was going on, to positive dominant when he was soothing me, to positive submissive when I later said where we were gonna go to eat... and my feelings did not change depending on who was ""in charge"" at the time. 

The issue, the bottom motherfuckin' line, was the fact I felt bad that he was better than me at a game I really liked, linked to other issues I'd been having with my self esteem at that time. Him being dominant throughout, even positive dominant, would not have helped at all - him passing my ""shit test"" wouldn't matter.

And that's the problem with shit tests - not everything is about dominance/submission or heirarchy. People do things for other reasons, like preservation of self esteem, unrelated to dominance or submission. You can try and twist it to make it about dominance submission if you wish, but if you're going to stretch it that far then... well, theories that explain everything explain nothing at all.

>And moreover, even complaining and acknowledging it makes for introducing a very robotic and controlled experience to an otherwise good relationship, replacing that feeling of uninhibitedness you get with your best friend.

We don't complain and acknowledge every little thing. We only acknowledge things that are causing harm to our relationship. We coooonstantly tease and belittle each other in lighthearted ways, we are always negging and laughing and whatever - but we can tell the difference between those light hearted exchanges and things that are rooted in something else that needs to be taken care of: like my self esteem issue. 

We have that same uninhibitedness and carefreeness that you say you achieve only by not acknowledging anything... however, we know how to acknowledge when something is a problem. 

We both observe our feelings toward one another, whether it's grown colder, whether someone feels less attracted, whether I feel I need ""time alone"", figure out the root of the problem, and rip it out as fast as possible by bringing it into the light and eradicating it. 

Every. Single. Time. I have felt unattracted to my partner or felt less sexually available, it was linked to something completely unrelated to dominance/submission - my attraction is based on how close I feel to my partner. When I was having self esteem issues, I felt less interested in sex - when I told him and he reassured me, complimented me, loved me, cuddled me, I felt infinitely more attracted to him because that emotional baggage was gone. When I communicate a problem and he listens, God, it's the best thing ever for our relationship, it makes me feel like I'm soaring.

> Men value submissiveness in a partner, while women want a dominant, confident and assertive man.

and

>they get a man who actively plans dates and romance. They get a man who kisses them every day. Who reignites that dead bedroom. Who goes to work happy and comes home to play with the kids. And takes her in bed like a mad animal.

You know what initially attracted me to my partner? The fact he was kinda androgynous. He was a bit metrosexual. He obsessed over his hair, loved Taylor Swift, read Twilight, had long, gorgeous hair. I loved the fact he was more feminine than I was, actually. I was a typical tomboy, didn't care a lick about my appearance, really, and he was the opposite in a way. I love that. I love femininity and androgyny in guys. All the guys I am attracted to are kinda feminine, cute, slender. I dunno. But I am not attracted to masculine, hairy, dominant men. I see muscles (moderately) bulging out of a t-shirt and I'm a bit repulsed (not to reduce RP to a muscle fest, but you know, do you even lift?). 

You know what? He kisses me every day. He plans dates and romance, he cuddles me obsessively and loves me dearly. I love him just as much, I would die for that man. He means the world to me and I literally cannot imagine my life without him. But you're telling me this is impossible because I am the more masculine of the two (not really more dominant, as we don't have an obvious leader... just, whoever is in the mood to make the decision does it)? No! Despite the fact there may be a trend of women liking masculinity, I have met counteless exceptions, from our female FWB who has a submissive boyfriend who is quite into pegging, to my male BDSM friend who is the most dominant but genuinely nice person I've ever met, to my other male friend who is also submissive in bed and gets turned on being humiliated. The tapestry of human sexuality is so beautiful, so varied, what we are attracted to is so. Much. More. Than just a dominance/submission men like femininity women like dominance sort of thing. Sometimes the paradigm is switched, sometimes it's so twisted it's unrecognizable.

When he was so depressed he never wanted to leave his room, when he was eternally stuck in negative submissive and I had to struggle to stay positive dominant, when I stayed by his side as the dominant, as the one driving the relationship, urging him to get out of our apartment, to do things... guiding him through that was a privilege for me, and afterwards he was so grateful to me and I felt so much love and desire for him. Dominance and submission had nothing to do with that. It was just about two people supporting each other.

>This doesn't mean you have to take belittling, but the way to recover from this rapport break with a net gain on what both of you seek in a partner is to consciously watch what the bastard is doing, and (I draw a blank here because I'm not a woman) act feminine. Teasing. Laughter. Positive cheery emotions. Maybe change the subject. A little push and pull. A little flirting.

We both do this. How are these feminine qualities? We are both very positive, tease-y, laughter filled people, and the second we stop being that way we figure out what's wrong and rectify it.

>A relationship should not have to be controlled

No, it shouldn't. Our relationship is not controlled by one person or the other, but rather the wonderful, organic, push and pull of a relationship that does not have a designated leader, one that is kept together, alive, and healthy by the wonders of introspection and communication, one that thrives on finding problems and rooting them out as quickly as possible... one that does not care a lick about who is dominant or submissive, and, as a result, doesn't really care about or is even particularly subject to ""shit tests"".

That was the point of all this, right? To say shit tests don't really explain much of human behavior, or at least my relationship in particular? Hot damn.

Anyway, I might actually pick up that circumplex model, it's really nifty and pretty helpful in explaining a lot of RP stuff.

">Interesting. Yet, big cities tend to be very rich (on average) and very blue. And we always know we'll have Joe the Plumber types who lust after belonging to higher income brackets and lie about being there. Also, this poll is for Kerry, when the media was solidly behind our terrist-killin saddam-slapping early wartime president Bush.

As for choosing the Kerry-Bush election, I just chose it because it was a near 50-50 election, which makes some comparisons easier. Obviously, in the 2008 election, Obama did better than Kerry did in basically every category.

Here's an explanation for you that might help you see why cities tend to be both ""rich"" and blue, even though the average Republican is richer.

I'm from a big-ish city, Washington DC. The District of Columbia itself is mostly poor. In the average year, DC will have about 1.5 times the poverty rate of America at large. (In 2007, that was 17% of people in DC below the poverty line vs 12% in the country at large.) The median income is right at the national median income, which sounds OK, except that the purchasing power of the dollar for basic household goods is far worse in DC than it is in most other places in America.

""But wait, didn't I read that DC has the best per capita income in the United States?""

Yes, you did. That's mean income, though, not median. Maybe 20% of the people in DC are wealthy. And that runs the table from affluence to OMGWTF wealth. They singlehandedly drag DC's mean income up into the stratosphere.

On voting day, the poorest 80% almost literally all vote for the Democrat. (No joke, look at Obama's stats in DC.) Then of the remaining wealthy 20%, the Democrat wins a slight majority. With 93% of the vote, Obama takes DC.

And then someone looks at the mean income stats and the voting totals, and says ""Look, DC is rich and it voted almost entirely for Obama. The rich vote Democrat.""

A less cursory analysis shows that this is simply not true."

"By my math the payout should average 15/16 or 93.75% (sum of payouts divided by number of sectors in the wheel), or a house edge of 6.25%. That's an awfully large house edge. If people are willing to gamble here with those odds then more power to you, but I feel like this isn't competitive.

I also have to worry about a site that, from what I can tell, is storing login credentials in the URL (i.e. why does the URL have to warn me not to ever share it? URLs should not be taken to be secure). While we're at it, why is the site not on https? The option to password protect your URL is cute, but there's no protection against brute forcing the password—I just put in a few dozen attempts at guessing a simple password and the site was perfectly content to let me keep on guessing and when I put in the right password it happily let me right on in.

To make the login information even less secure, it's stored as a plaintext cookie from the site. Anyone who manages to get read access to a computer that has played on this site can go find the cookies and look for the one named XPMSPINUID. If the UID was not password protected then that's all that is needed. If it was password protected then it's just a matter of a brute force attack, which is literally one of the easiest attacks to protect against for a web-based password. 

Then there's the issue of provable fairness. The tab provided does not fully describe an algorithm, which is a minimum requirement for provable fairness—without knowing the full algorithm used it is impossible to check that the output is correct. The ""Fair?"" tab gives a single line of arithmetic that can be fully computed from the client seed, which the client should be able to trust anyway (they picked and/or approved it, after all), but it stops short of describing how that number from 0-16 translates to a wheel segment (it cannot just compare to the table given; I checked that). What does the line "" = final order in server seed"" mean? If you are going to claim provable fairness then you need to actually prove fairness and not just stop halfway along the process. In investigating the provable fairness of the game I came across this post, where you state

> All the code that deals with the randomness of the spins is protected on our server. We have our own algorithm which ensures the spin is random. 

This is the opposite of provable fairness. This is just saying ""trust us, our code is fair."" It may very well be fair, but this statement does absolutely nothing to prove that point. Ultimately, I or anyone else should be able to state ""If the server seed is ABCDEF and the client seed is GHIJKL and the spin number is MNO then the wheel will land on P.QRx"" for any server seed, client seed, and spin number (or any other pieces of data used, but all data must be revealed either directly or in hash form before the spin and it must all be completely available some short time after the spin (e.g. the next day)). 

I'm also worried that the server seed is not appropriately hidden. I can't see any examples of old server seeds (another red flag, but perhaps this is just due to the fact that the website is too young—I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here), but it appears that it is just a hash of a single number. While computing preimages attacks of modern cyrptographic hash functions is unreasonably difficult it is conceivable to compute a rainbow table of all positive integers up to the ~15 digits that the client seed has (with 1 TB of memory one could expect to have collisions with a fraction of a percent of hashes; the user can get a new hash by getting a new account—fast and almost free—until they get a known hash). Some quick testing shows that the client seed cannot exceed 19 digits. If the server seed is a similar length then this is not enough security to protect against rainbow tables, which could lead to betters bleeding you dry with unreasonably good ""luck.""

I thought Weinstein was against the policy of telling whites they couldn't be on campus during the ""Day of Absence."" Students confronted him about it, he wanted to discuss it, and they said this to him, shouted him down, and talked over him. Thats what I saw in the video.

You're saying POC do not want to be shouted down by whites. Understood. Based on that video, it's ok for POC to talk over whites when they try to discuss their own experiences. That seems acceptable.

"> qualify your accounts more thoroughly

Yeah, if I qualified prospects by the criteria of all having stakeholders present and on board, then I'd be lucky to have one client per country - and I don't speak enough languages and have enough visas to be so picky. Not to mention the change in cost and ROI. I once got lucky where a private equity firm bought a client and mandated they all take part and cooperate, but those were exceptional circumstances.

> How are you doing with prospecting? Are you finding enough clients / getting enough leads?

Cold-contacting C-level execs isn't super easy. There are only 200-300 qualified people per western country and right industry (USA more, due to the size of the economy of course). Depending on the prospect, it can be very difficult to guess an email, they refuse to put through calls and voicemail boxes don't work, and don't respond to email/linkedin messages (in which case I keep trying other execs from the same prospect).

The best analogy I can think of is and industry-specific software tool that someone like IBM or Oracle would own and market - that's the sort of sales ""opportunity"" we're trying to capitalize on. It takes a lot of beating the bushes to find an exec who is ready...

>we really need something for end-users in business environments.

Arguably, if the employer knows their new employee will have to have basic competency with a program like Word or QuickBooks, they should ensure the interview and resume screening process filters out anybody who fails this competency. The problem is, most management/hiring types don't pass, either, or just don't understand the technology even if they don't need to use it themselves. I've always thought that - given we know that tech downtime and mistakes can account for literally MILLIONS in lost revenue - hiring panels should include an IT department head with simple power of veto.

This is problematic. The state defines who is a serial killer/rapists, who is a paedophile, and who is a war criminal (just look at Curtis LeMay. The dude said he would be on trial for crimes if the Allies lost.)

This means that giving the state the power of the death penalty is essentially giving the state the ultimate power, the power over life and death. The ruling class, who control the state, are able to choose who lives or who dies. This is a dangerous power to allow the state to control, particularly with the panoptic zones of control we see being established around the world.

>God is all-loving but also perfectly wise. If suffering exists, then taking into account just those two qualities, we know that God not only expresses his love in suffering (e.g., the cross), but also that he has perfect reasons for allowing suffering to exist because he is perfectly wise.

I'm a bit speechless. This is some of the most anti-intellectual rhetoric I've ever heard. It basically amounts to ""Yeah, I know it doesn't make any sense at all. Don't worry about any of that stuff that sounds really horrible and unnecessary, just take comfort in knowing that god must have some good reason for doing it.""

Additionally, omnipotence should allow god to do anything. Meaning that there cannot exist a reason why he could not have done something in a different way if he wanted to. Saying ""he had a reason for doing it that way"" makes no sense, because if he is omnipotent, he can make it so instantly. The logic still defeats your argument.

Also, we know from the bible that god makes mistakes (whoa... omniscience conflict ahead).

>The Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. The Lord said, ""I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them"" (Gen. 6:6-7).

>I [the Lord] regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not carried out My commands (1 Sam. 15:11)

Is it not possible god made mistakes when creating the universe, because he is flawed? And then, at that point, isn't it more plausible that the reason there are so many flaws in the theology is because it was written by bronze age people and isn't actually true?

I'm also not Sure President Obama would have run all that differently than Hillary did, messaging wise. He was out there saying Trump would give the KKK a seat at the whitehouse... He was on the late night shows to make fun of Trump, he was at the fund raisers...

Update: [Here's a wheel you can spin to get a selection of popular Tesla FUD!]( http 
____

BTW., here's a quick example of how Reuters, despite the neutral language they usually use in their reporting, could end up scoring so high on the FUD tracker.

Consider the following recent Reuters article:

> ""Tesla shares skid further on concern over Model 3, report on brake test""
>
> (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares closed sharply lower on Tuesday amid analyst skepticism about its Model 3 cars and a news report that said the company had stopped running a brake test on its cars.

Here's the various tools of FUD Reuters used in that article:

- Note the summary: it's a technically correct but misleading summary of Tesla's decision to test every Model 3 on the track, and a misleading summary that some (perma-bear) analysts are skeptical. Reading that sentence a reader could get the (false) impression that all analysts are skeptical - which is not true.
- Also note the ambiguity of the ""skepticism about its Model 3 cars"" wording: the real skepticism was mainly about Tesla's ability to meet high demand. The wording could also be understood that there's some kind of problem with the Model 3.
- They then continue the article by quoting ""surprise"" about lower delivery numbers in Q2 - without mentioning the well-known 200,000 U.S. deliveries limit Tesla was running up against in Q2 even a single time. Readers are left with the false impression that Tesla was somehow unable to deliver.
- They later on clarify the brake test news by adding more detail - but many readers only read the headline and the first few sentences. The interleaving of the Q2 delivery numbers information unnecessarily increased the amount of time it took for readers to get to the real information.
- They also quote Business Insider's biased reporting - a well-known source of Tesla FUD, without mentioning the poor track record of Business Insider Tesla reporting and the various controversies their reporting suffered from in the past.
- Note that later in the article they are also first quoting the analyst with the lowest price target for TSLA (without mentioning their poor record of predictions), before quoting analysts with higher targets.
- There are some positive Tesla quotes in the article as well: dead last, read by the fewest readers.

This is a typical way FUD is done: article starts off with a misleading title, biased summary, then goes into the details that add more fairness. But in news reporting the order of information is everything - and they made sure the order of information is as Tesla negative as possible - without making any outright false statements.

While Reuters is one of the better news services, anyone who thinks that Reuters is always neutral in every topic is incredibly naive, and their Tesla reporting has been subtly slanted for a long time.

The GOP committed to not working with Obama before he spent his first night in the Whitehouse, for no reason other than him being ""on the other team"".

"I kinda feel like I'm having to defend the Trump stuff which for me is hard to do. I am by no means a Trump guy. I agree with some of his policies but pretty much loathe him personally. Kind of a hard mix to gel. Even with his worts, he is still better than Hillary. But to your points:

1. I agree that he has been unnecessarily antagonistic to not only the IC community but a lot of others. I believe his comments were directed to the Obama appointees in the IC leadership, but the media made it sound like he was at war with the rank and file. Media distorts like that…alot.

2. I would love to see this admin be absolutely clean, but I don't think the leaks will stop if they were. IMHO these are coming from faithful Dems with access who are more than happy to violate federal law for the cause. Obama's admin wasn't the squeaky clean group they were portrayed to be, but the rank and file in the govt is so profoundly Democrat that the leaks were few and largely enabled his vision. The game the leakers and the media are playing now is to throw shit out there, let the left spin it as the most outrageous thing ever and sadly it will stick with too many folks. Examples: The boogie men from Russia stole the election (No. Podesta fell for scam designed to get grandmas to give up their passwords), the heartless Trump is so cruel to the poor downtrodden brownskinned people from those countries seven identified by the Obama admin as being high risk but Trump is the bad guy. The thing he screwed up is rolling it out before he has the SCOTUS judge in place. He also screwed up by saying Islamic ban during the campaign, but that was clearly campaign hyperbole. A real Islamic ban would reach a bunch more countries than the seven listed but that’s minor. The AP National Guard story is another good example. Pure BS but Schumer almost shed another tear over the thought of it, completely omitting that Obama activated the NG for border duty. There is also the late term Obama order giving access raw NSA data to all the rest of the agencies. That alone makes it much more likely for agenda driven leaks to occur.

3. I think the line has been crossed with Flynn. While we don't know everything, what are his crimes? Even if he said the sanctions are gone Jan 21, it wasn't a crime. Lying to FBI? Had the FBI asked any decent questions of HRC, I am pretty sure they could have caught her in a lie or two. Flynn's rights were violated in that leak and he was politically assassinated as a result. It was kind of a soft coup.

Not gonna lie, the Trump folks could learn a lot about messaging. Just having someone do some basic fact checking before they hit the send button would help. That whole crowd size thing was just so unnecessary, self defeating and embarrassing. 

If I were on the Trump team, say in Priebus' role, I would get Trump a twitter editor. Someone who allows the Trump edge but watches out for easily provable misstatements. They also need to be fully aware that every time anyone in the admin goes in front of the media, they will be treated with contempt and any misspoken word will be repeated ad nauseum on all channels. Realize that even Fox is not their friend (well maybe Fox and Friends and Hannity but the rest, not so much). And ultimately behave like it. Don’t give the enemy any ammo.

If can afford to travel, do it. I'm not saying go do some fancy vacation around Europe or something. Just backpack, stay in hostel, meet new people. For all you know, you could just go out camping, enjoy nature, enjoy the night skies, be a new person. 
 
My point here is enjoy life, do new things, don't let you life revolve around finding a girl. The girl will eventually come, trust me. Just go out there, mix with different people. If you have no one to look forward to, look forward to being with yourself. Re-discover yourself. Continue being the introvert you are, but just go out and do things by yourself. You don't need to live your life for someone else, live it for yourself. Don't let society dictate how and when you find a girl. You are a 24 year old single guy right now. So what? 
 
So please, don't be miserable for being single all this while. You have you a great future ahead, and even a great career. So don't waste anything by just giving up now. Give yourself more time, don't pressurize yourself with having to find a girl and just carry on with life, enjoy it!! 
 
And please don't disappear after reading this post. Get back to us. We care."

You say you've been working on this magical and exciting idea for 3 years, but only as an outline. I've been working on ideas for 17 years, finally working on a project I'm happy with and getting produced. And yet you have nothing to show for, except some halfcocked idea and half cooked ""pitch"".

> Essentially it is an epic sci-fi-fantasy hero's journey, and though I've tried to make it as original/disguised as possible, I've tried to take the best elements from massively successful stories such as Harry Potter, Star Wars, Death Note etc. I've attempted to convey the same Alice-in-Wonderland-esque feeling that you get when you step into Hogwarts or SAO; it's a world that you just want to live in. Hence, work was done in planning out even the architectural-style. Furthermore, a certain supernatural macguffin is incorperated that essentially achieves the same plot-related functions as the Deathnote, but is undeniably quite different and hopefully doesn't make the reader think ""that's like Deathnote"". This macguffin is specifically constructed to pave the way to an information-war (concealing and probing for info) and an psychological/anticipation-battle; much like in Deathnote.

That bit there, that says nothing. Nothing at all. It's an epic. It's based on exciting successful projects. There's a macguffin. It's a world of wonder. This is garbage saying nothing. Corporate lingo and pseudo-intellectualism masquerading as something with substance. 

Outlines are not supposed to be perfect, they're there to guide you in the actual creative process, to get the written or drawn work out. You keep planning when you should be chiseling at the marble slab. I've written outlines but they never end up being the same thing when I'm done.

> when it's already established that different factions speak different languages, suspension of disbelief is lifted when previously-icelandic speaking viking starts speaking in biker-gang english.

Campaign, everyone speaks english. Why? Because players need to be able to understand what's going on. The argument is between immersion and function. Is it immersive to have the heroes speak their own language, yes it is, but is it functional? No in the slightest. 

Let's take your own example of Skyrim. Each race speaks a diffrent language, elves speak elvish, norse speak nordish, red guard speak whatever language theirs is called, and so on and so on. Yet when you play the game, everyone speaks the same language. Why? Because it's a functional aspect that players need in order to understand what is going on. Same rule applies here. 

> this change CLEARLY has an overall negative or neutral impact on the players

No it doesn't, because the vocal minority does not represent everyone. People whoa re dissatisfied with a change are far more likely to voice their opinion about it, than people who do like the change. This is true for literally everything about people ever, not just games.

Since you've already forgotten your original comment, I'll remind you of the reason you got that response...""Well there has to be a god for one to be against one...lol"". 

Communism is an economic AND a political system. The reason Communists are atheists is because Karl Marx, one of the people responsible for Communism, rejected it outright (Quote: Religion is opium of the people).

I brought up the correlation because Communist countries are societies which reject religion completely. I was pointing out the flaw in your thinking that religion is responsible for the violence in the world. It isn't. If that were true, Communist nations would be some of the most peaceful societies in the world since they do not embrace religion. The truth of the matter is that people and life are more complex than you appear to recognize. There is good and bad in every socio-economic spectrum of the world.

>...the issue is many fans of these old works see them as the actual word of a real sky monster and relevant to issues today in their full ""literal interpretation"".

You're referring to orthodox or fundamentalist believers. The important thing to remember here is that religious believers are not a monolithic group. Religious beliefs exist on a sliding scale, not unlike the political spectrum. As such, it is not uncommon for political/religious moderates, such as myself, to butt heads with fundamentalists in both the political and religious arena. Those who espouse extremist religious views are often the most extreme elements of religious followers, the American Taliban if you will. These people are also most often the ones espousing an authoritarian form of governance (e.g., Ted Cruz, FAR right wing Conservatives, etc.). You will never find moderate elements of most religions and political groups espousing the abject nonsense we often hear coming from extremists for the simple reason that they recognize it violates the fundamental tenets of their religious and social values. The best elements of this nation's founding principles came from moderate religious elements of our society.

>It's the ramblings of bronze age nomads when the modern church doesn't want to go along with it and the word of god when they want to settle the tax status of married homosexuals.

Contrary to your derisive view of fundamental religious tenets and principles, they have stood the test of time. If you can point to a better set of tenets and principles, feel free to share what they happen to be. I'm open-minded enough to consider better principles and values, but I have yet to see any from those who claim to have them. Why do I think most religious principles and values are as relevant today as they were when they were proposed? I've witnessed people who applied those principles in life succeed and those who rejected them fail repeatedly for close to 5 decades. I have discovered the very same outcome by delving throughout world history.

>Who could possibly say blind faith cannot be correct sometimes? Who would use the fact that blind faith can be correct as evidence that something is correct?

I didn't stake the absolutist position on religion or the unknown...you did.

>I can't fathom the motivation to engage in this other than knowing people like belonging to a group and thinking they are better than other groups.

You're touching on an aspect of humanity that's true for some people (i.e., the need by some to belong to one group or another). That's true of every socio-economic spectrum of society, including many within the atheist community. From personal experience, I have never found that most religious believers worship in order to belong to a social group as much as to form closer ties to God. It's a very personal choice. Are there some who worship for social reasons? Yes, but they're missing the point of faith and worship...to worship God and gain spiritual enrichment, not to join social cliques. To expand on this somewhat, most people's religious affiliations are based upon the denominations they are born into. Many people switch denominations as they age, but that's simply because they find that different denominations are a better match for their personal views/values.

>Christopher Columbus getting lucking and finding land has no bearing on whether or not there is sky monster.

Flat earthers once shared your views too. It was because they couldn't see past their personal beliefs and the absence of convincing proof either. Confirmation bias is a form of tunnel vision.

>How'd we get off me being an Antisemitic because I'm an atheist?

Help us understand how you think you are pro-Semitic by denigrating and attacking fundamental religious principles and values in the Jewish community. It's the fundamental values by which they define their lives. You appear to be engaging in religious contrarianism that defies logic and reasoning. I'm not saying that you are waging a personal Holocaust here. However, denigrating deeply held principles and values by any socio-economic group would hardly put you on ""their team"".

"Where to even begin?

The first sentence is ironic. As is often the case, Todd is wrong here because he's attempting to make a nice argument that isn't derived from observations of reality or practical experience, but rather what he thinks will play best to the crowd.

Peter asks us to believe that Bitcoin can be, in fact should be, a currency that is worse than conventional currencies in all ways except privacy. But such a path leads to only one place - widespread bans and crackdowns. To back this up, here are some observations of reality; currencies that tried what Peter advocates we try right now:

- eGold. Founders indicted and imprisoned.
- Liberty Reserve dollars. Founders indicted, most likely to be imprisoned.
- PayPal. Started out as a strongly libertarian Bitcoin-like payment system:

> ""Operating out of Silicon Valley, the idealistic vision of the company was one of a borderless currency, free from governmental controls .... However, PayPal's success quickly drew the attention of hackers, scam artists and organized crime groups, who used the service for frauds and money laundering. New security measures stemmed the tide of fraud and customer complaints, but government officials soon stepped in .... Some states, such as Louisiana, banned PayPal from operating in their states altogether.""

 http 

Now very much a part of the establishment.

I could go on, there are others, but I think these three serve to illustrate the purpose. A system that markets itself as ""the same as other things, but with better privacy"" appeals to a small niche of mainstream users who are unusually privacy conscious, and all criminals. It's easy for a legitimate service with the best intentions to be quickly overwhelmed by this. 

Via analogy with spam filtering, anyone dumb enough to operate an open mail proxy with no abuse controls gets globally blacklisted very quickly, as it attracts spammers like a magnet. It's just not workable. This is not due to government intervention - it's a free market response to abuse of public infrastructure.

I do not believe Bitcoin has a future as being ""worse than everything else but with better privacy"". That's a future that results in the existing companies that are pushing Bitcoin into ordinary everyday lives leaving, only the Silk Road remaining, and either explicit bans or disappearance into obscurity following shortly after. The outcome is useless both to people who care a lot about privacy and people who don't. Being decentralised helps a bit but widespread suppression is still possible. For example cars are decentralised but it's still possible to enforce speeding laws, despite the absence of any central authority that can prevent cars from speeding.

Satoshi's white paper starts with an unashamedly mainstream viewpoint. It complains about the high overheads of the banking system, the lack of micropayments. There's no shame in wanting to build something better than what we have now, in all respects, whilst recognising that tweaking one knob here can have problematic effects over there."

"There is some truth in the blog. She's right that Bethenny is weirdly making Jules' eating disorder about her and her experiences dealing with her mother. Like, I can get where Bethenny is coming from there, but Jules is correct that it is an awfully self-absorbed take on the situation.

She's also totally correct that the bus convo between Bethenny and Dorinda was pretty shitty. And she is right to bring up the Hamptons visit, which was just incredibly poor behavior on Bethenny and Carole's part.

But a lot of her points had me rolling my eyes. Her interpretation of Carole's ""Oh Jesus!"" was quite different from mine. Granted, she was THERE, I was not, and it had to do with HER. But when I hear ""Oh Jesus,"" I consider it an exclamation of dismay. I thought Carole WAS being sympathetic in that moment for Jules' relapse, not criticizing her. The denial comment came in a talking head that was filmed who knows how much later.

As for Bethenny and Carole feeling that Jules' anger was coming out of nowhere -- yeah. I did too. Again, they actually lived this, we just get a highly edited version of things. But I find it ironic that Jules starts out her blog talking about how she doesn't understand why this group is constantly dominated by women bursting in and out of rooms screaming at one another when SHE was the person who did that this episode. She showed up at that dinner ratcheted up by Dorinda Meddler (and also, I suspect, by producers who wanted her to add some spice to the mix) and popped off over issues Bethenny and Carole didn't even know Jules HAD. They admitted to discussing the eating disorder, including at the pizza-making party. But the idea that they were badmouthing Jules' marriage appear to have come from absolutely nothing more than Jules' paranoia. (And, knowing what we know now, Jules had every right to be paranoid -- but about Michael, not her castmates.) Had Jules said to Bethenny and Carole, ""Hey, guys, I need to talk to you about something; I don't think you're being sensitive about my eating disorder,"" I suspect the situation would have played out much differently. But she came in loaded for bear, Bethenny and Carole were dealing with a human claymore exploding in their faces, and they got defensive. I would have too.

As for Jules' point that Bethenny apparently just decides when she can move on from personal slights against her -- yeah. We ALL do that. Do you mean to tell me you've never been pissed off at a friend, backed off, and then after a period of time reconnected and picked things back up? That happens in real life all the time. One of the other elements people on the show, and on this sub, rarely acknowledge is that, after Bethenny loses her shit on someone, she frequently apologizes to them because she knows it was wrong. You can argue that it's not sincere, or an act, but again -- I do the same thing. All the time. In the heat of the moment, sometimes you just lose it. And after you come down, you realize you said things you shouldn't have. Bethenny has done that with Sonja and Luann this season. I won't be surprised if Jules doesn't end up doing that with Bethenny in an episode or two. I don't get why this is somehow poor behavior.

I also will maintain that Carole was not wrong with her comment, in both this episode and last week's blog, that friends talk about each other behind their backs. WHERE IS THE LIE? Seriously. Get off the high horse and get real. When you get together with a group of your friends, do you mean to tell me you do not end up discussing what's going on with other members of your friend circle who are not present? Are you making fun of them? Probably not. I hope not. But you are discussing them and comparing notes on what you all think of the situation. That is what ALL OF THESE WOMEN do on ALL OF THESE SHOWS and it is their JOB. It is also very much real life. Getting bent out of shape that your cast members are discussing your stuff when you are not present is incredibly naive and awfully immature. I actually lost respect for Jules there. There's no malice in these situations. Nobody is scheming. They are processing whatever you put out there, and they do it regarding every member of the group, not just Jules.

And let me just say: how is Dorinda escaping ANY blame for this when she is literally the connective tissue going between all of these characters, stirring the pot? Multiple times this episode alone we saw her acting as the go-between that ultimately ended up in someone exploding at another person. I'm glad she's there. She is the binding force for the cast currently. But most of the fights this episode came down to, ""Dorinda told me you said THIS."" And yet Dorinda is innocent in all of this. Bull."

"Norway

Oh, so much comedy the past week, maybe the most comedic week in a long time!

Our Minister of Justice, Anders Anundsen released an ""information video"" that tells of what he has achieved as the Minister of Justice. The video opens with him denouncing two major Norwegian news sources: NRK (our state broadcaster) and Aftenposten (one of the third largest newspapers). He seems to imply that he dislikes that the media is critical and that they investigate controversies with the policies of the government. He also claims that they never have any positive angle on what the government does and that they remain negative of his actions and policies. (Arguably, this is the role of the media in a democracy; to be critical and investigate.)

The video itself is nothing but the Justice Minister bragging about what he has achieved throughout his term for 34 (yes; 34!) damn minutes. In the video he ""interviews"" members of the police force, members of the Justice Department and local police departments. Consistently, his questions are leading and are aimed at receiving positive or affirmative answers. 

Furthermore, there is a huge problem with the Justice Minister interviewing members of the police force and bureaucrats because he is basically their superior. He could essentially have them fired if he wanted to, and that puts pressure on the interviewees to answer like the Justice Minister wants. Additionally, Anundsen proposed a legalisation in 2009 that limits the use of bureaucrats and department-members in election time (which happens to be in two weeks). The legalisation did not pass back then, but it goes to show how much of a hypocrite Anundsen is. 

The video has been mocked, to say it lightly. Norwegian media-experts have called it propaganda, likening it to propaganda you see from North-Korea. Others have said that it is highly problematic that he is interviewing his inferiors. Several parodies and remixes (one dubstep version is available) of the video has been made, with hilarious results. A politician from an opposing party made his own ""brag-video"" where he talks about great he is and what he has achieved. 

The video also uses clips from our state broadcaster (NRK) without permission and music without permission from the musician (thus, breaching copyright law). On top of that, the video also shows uncensored video from a Norwegian refugee detention centre where the faces of detainees are visible. This is in breach of Norwegian law and the government's privacy watchdog (Datatilsynet) has opened an investigation into the video. "

And we specify by putting the male prefix infont because that's the essence of the complaint: it's not about an ""intellectual gender bias"" it's about a society that encourages men to assume they always know more than women and thus to explain things to them."

"Lightning internally uses .001 satoshi (1/1000 of a satoshi) but rounds down when committing from off-chain to on-chain.

It's easier to add such improvements off-chain, by-the-way, as you only need consensus with a direct trading partner in a channel. If you need, for example, 0.000001 satoshi payments, you just look for a route where all the channels support that extension, or make a channel directly with the payee with that extension.

We don't need 100Gb blocks, LOL, just better off-chain.

Making changes to on-chain requires everyone to agree to the consensus. Since you can't even make 100% of the world agree that evolution is true, good luck with that."
"Personal and business interactions can be a little hard at times. I think it is a mixture of only children, a highly stratified system, and just a completely different culture around etiquette and manners, but dealing with Chinese can be off-putting at times for Westerners. The sense we get is that they are extremely self-centered, and they can be extremely demeaning and obstinate. 

Especially in the business world, if your title does not match up with the other guys in the room, you will immediately be treated as a peon and you will be ordered to do things, never asked. This is super awkward in situations where the companies are working together, or when the Chinese company is the vendor. I'll be sitting in a meeting and have a VP that needs me talking down and completely marginalizing me because I'm only a ""director"", when the reality is that I'm going to be doing most of decision making that will keep this partnership working. Even if I was a mere peon, I couldn't imagine treating the people that work for me with that much disdain.

Note: This is possibly an English as a second language issue is well. They are communicating with me in English, so I try to chalk a lot of it up to that, however...

A big part of the problem is just a difference in how we communicate. Protestant and Catholic cultures (think US, Canada, UK, Germany, etc) have a natural tendency to be apologetic in their communication. Even if it is not outright, we generally phrase our emails and speaking in a way that at least hints at ""Sorry to inconvenience you, but could you maybe...""

The Chinese I've had experience with have absolutely zero of this, and so it makes emails really aggravating at times since they are extremely literal and can be very demanding.

I do agree that more people will have access and it may create more addicts, but how is that any different from the pharmaceutical companies today? They created a nation of addicts, then our government started putting up stricter regulations. The majority of them then switched to heroin because it is cheaper and easily available. The government cracking down has just created a much bigger problem now. There is no perfect system, but decriminalization or legalization is the much more humane solution. "

">The chances are I know way more about video production than you.

Unlikely, given the fact that you think linking to your channel where the most advanced editing I seem to see is cutting from one game clip to another proves some kind of point. Here is a list of multiple different live face swap apps that could be used to knock that video out in an hour or so. Also, the compositing that Ethan does in AE is very basic, so I don't fully understand why you're pulling that out like it's some kind of ultimate trump card. It's not impressive to name drop AE with no context, especially if you think what Ethan's doing in it is some kind of top-level composite work. A lot of Ethan's editing is great, and you can tell that there is a lot of effort put in, but that is not present whatsoever in the Harambe video.

As for the rest of the points you made, while the act of uploading a video takes time depending on your connection, it doesn't take effort, and that's the point I'm making about the Harambe video, it's patently low effort. Also, if it'd take you a long time to make this thumbnail in Photoshop, you're not exactly a wizard with the program.

I'm glad you enjoyed the video, I really am, I like for people to enjoy the things that they enjoy, it's awesome. But regardless of whether the video is bad or not, it is comparatively very low effort. I want the best for H3H3, since they were one of my favorite channels on YouTube a while back, but liking something doesn't make it immune to criticism or speculation about some of the stranger decisions they make. I still think that merging E&H with H3H3 was a mistake, as they make very different content and the merge seems to have lowered the average quality across the board, but again, that's my opinion.

When you make things consistently at a certain degree of quality, people come to expect that sort of quality from the things you make. You set a standard. When you suddenly produce videos with half or lower the production quality because you've got a guaranteed built in audience, it comes across as slacking because you have the ability to.

EDIT: Took a look at some of your other videos, I take back what I said about the editing. A lot of your typography and whatnot is solid. Sorry about that. That being said, you being proficient with that makes me more confused as to how you think face swapping is difficult."

OP: 
""What are some songs you have listened to where the music is so good it conveys the message without even having to read the lyrics?""

Guy looking for C16: 
""4' 33"" by John Cage perfectly evokes the precise feeling you are experiencing at the exact moment of the performance.""

Me: What about a sine wave @ 440hz

c hunter 16: Consider how different that sounds if you play it on different instruments.

rebuttle: Consider how different Beethoven's 7th would sound if you played it on a canoe, I don't think the test for ""clearly conveying an idea"" requires some sort of transposition-ally static quality, but at the same time, any instrument which can play 440hz is actually vibrating at 440hz and through the very exact damping of partials you will get exactly a 440hz sine wave. However, I was not talking about ""an instrument playing 440hz"" i was talking about the actual thing you listened to which is a sine tone at 440hz. it would have pretty much any quality you might assign to 4'33"". But your original post implies that 4'33"" does convey a specific message, and if that's not what you meant, then, whatever.

Anywho, it seems from the context that what you wanted to say was ""none"" but then wanted to show that you are a well trained smarty-pants.

Additionally, the obvious correct answers are: 

""Where is My Mind"" - The Pixies

""Pierrot Lunaire"" - Schoenberg

""Requiem Mass in D Minor II - Dies Irae"" - Mozart

""Carmina Burana"" - Carl Orff

""Mr. Grieves"" - The Pixies

""Tank"" - The Seatbelts

""Ride on Shooting Star"" - The Pillows

""Summertime"" - George Gershwin

I think ""The Sound of Silence"" conveys a pretty clear idea at least in western culture. Anyone who had never heard that song would probably get a similar reaction if they were raised on popular music of the last few decades.

Honestly now that I started thinking about it, there are songs which convey their feeling very well and though, obviously, it's not the exact same feeling for everyone you wouldn't guess that ""yellow submarine"" is about the horrors of war or that ""Yesterday"" was about going to clubs and getting drunk.

Though i wouldn't say that there are many stellar examples of what OP is talking about - there are some.

You are kind of missing my point; the only reason why you respond the way you do, is because you are acostumed to having it all your way, having history be, well rewritten, to emphasise how awesome the US is, and how Americans did everything in the history of the world. Even to the point of blatent historical falsification. If the situation were different, and all American achievements were ignored or appropriated by others, you would be angry too. You know you would, you know how defensive Americans get when they are critised (like anybody else btw).

There is a wonderful Buddhist story. Some guy got into a sect in Ancient India where he was said he needs to murder 1000 people and collect their finger on a necklace to attain enlightenment. So he was down to 999 victims and was looking for the last one. So he saw the Buddha walking there, raised his knife and went after him, saying ""Stop!"" And the Buddha answered: ""I have stopped already. When will you?"" (i.e. stop fucking up your karma). The guy realize he was wrong, and decide to use his awsum fighter skillz to protect people from harm instead of murdering them, working off that bad karma, and then getting so much good karma that he attained enlightenment.

The moral of the story is that sometimes it is better to be efficient than good.

"I do really like Black and White, their my favorite non-mystery dungeon Pokemon games; It's the only one to even put in a genuine attempt at showing why people outside of the Pokemon league would actually battle, and not just get in a fist fight; it had an enemy with interesting reasons than 'evil because evil' hell, all but 1 of the gym leaders did things outside of the gym!

But at the same time, the game is plot driven, constantly sucks the player character's cock, gives little challenge, encourages mindless grinding, and tries to talk about how each pokemon is valuable, yet has gameplay that makes most pokemon feel worthless. Two easy and fundemental changes can deal with most of these issues, as well as provide better stories.

First, use game mechanics to not make Pokemon worthless, that means change how you find/catch wild pokemon so that getting one is a noteworthy accomplishment. (Dex nav is the right direction here); as well as remove beating up on wild pokemon as a method of grinding. The super training idea is a great start, but needs to be worked on; also, about half-way through the game, every trainer should have a full team. There's too damn many times where I have to ask 'how the fuck did someone get this far with only a wingul?'

Secondly; make a more open world game centered on exploration. Allow the player to go to which city they want, and make each city have their own questline and story to complete. You can still have the Pokemon league as a devise to give a reason to go across the land, but actually explain what it is. Is it a governing body? Is it a sort of sports thing?

Human history and technological progress are pretty much everything that your post is about. What else it there in it to relate to? Sheesh. 

Going all the way back to your original question again the evidence that feminist have for women being oppressed is the highly divided gender roles that existed back in those agrarian cultures. They focused on all the bad parts women experienced and ignored the good and then they take all the good parts men experienced and ignored all the bad and said, ""OPPRESSION!""

Then the industrial revolution comes along and improves society's overall condition. Giving those upper class 'uppity' women enough free time to make lots of noise and cause trouble.

Technology changes faster than society does and feminists call this change lag 'oppression'.

And, because so much of it is still being debated by people smarter than me, and I have no urge to rush to judgement either way, I can honestly say I don't ""believe"" in evolution. Certainly not yet. but I don't take to task people who do. 

I also believe in God. If it is true, that He is a supreme being, He certainly COULD have created anything he wanted to in 6 days, or even 6 minutes. He says He created the mountains with layers and decay showing age. He created Adam, not as a baby, but as a grown man, who certainly looks like he has aged, even if he was only seconds old. Maybe he made the world to just ""look"" old. Maybe he is messing with us. Is this a fact? I have no idea. If He does exist, I am quite certain He looks down at us and laughs at what we think. 

But that's the beauty of it. I'm not a scientist, I'm not a politician. I don't have to come to any conclusion on the matter any time soon, My beliefs and theories affect no one. And every day is another opportunity to read, and learn, and wonder.

"This isn't /r/politics. Keep your posts civil.

>The Executive Branch does provide their budget proposal but in no ways does this mean that this is the bare minimum that the Executive Branch needs to function.

Yeah, the budget wasn't ""the bare minimum"" required to keep the State Department functioning, but upgrading embassy security would require more than the ""bare minimum"" it takes to keep the Department of State running.

From the State Department's Accountability Review Board:

""For many years the State Department has been engaged in a struggle to obtain the resources necessary to carry out its work, with varying degrees of success. This has brought about a deep sense of the importance of husbanding 
resources to meet the highest priorities, laudable in the extreme in any government department. But it has also had the effect of conditioning a few State Department managers to favor restricting the use of resources as a general orientation.""

Less money = less gets done. 

>It's nothing new. You are more than welcome to provide one example throughout the history of Congress in which a budget proposal by the Executive Branch was accepted as is and given exactly as requested.

I'm talking about specific funding requests for specific purposes. Your generalization says nothing about the merits of those specific requests.

>Secretary Clinton and Deputy Assistant Secretary Charlene Lamb both testified that those budget cuts that you mentioned had nothing to do with denying additional security for Ambassador Stevens.

I did a Ctrl + F for ""Clinton"" in both your linked sources and found nothing that says Clinton made the claim you attributed to her.

As for Lamb, she did say that it wasn't a budget shortage that prevented her from stationing more guards at Benghazi. That was the specific question she was responding to. She was not asked if a larger budget would have improved security at Benghazi.

Here's what Lamb said about the reason that she didn't station more guards at Benghazi:

-begin quote-

After that Republican members of Congress honed in on Lamb, who was also a witness, accusing her of failing to recognise the seriousness of the threat. Lamb responded that the requests were for more personnel in Tripoli and it would have made no difference to how many security men would have been protecting the Benghazi consulate where protection was in any case mostly in the hands of a pro-government militia.

""We had the correct number of assets in Benghazi on the night of 9/11,"" Lamb testified.""

-end quote-

Source

Lamb claims that she thought the security at Benghazi was adequate; therefore, of course she didn't have a budgetary reason for not stationing more men there. In her eyes, there were already enough guards defending Benghazi. There's no budget so low that it can't afford 0 more guards.

In the end, the main point of my last post, a point that you ignored, is that the Benghazi investigation was a partisan Republican effort to damage Hillary Clinton for political purposes. It is thus incomplete, both in gathering relevant evidence and in assigning responsibility for the tragedy. Its conclusions regarding Hillary Clinton's role and the role of Congress' budgetary decisions must be understood in that context.

"As long as we are talking about Society, and what is best for it, I don't have children either, but i feel school funding is imporant due to the negative consequences of not having schools. If there is no schools, then crime goes up, land values go down, and progress comes to a halt. It is therefore societies benefit that public education exists. 
 
However, an individual living or dying has little or no impact. The death of a person has no real overarching negative consequences on society as a whole, and therefore, is not in the societal interest to invest. To the contrary, given our current population count and the limited resources of this planet, i would argue it is a befit to the larger society if we people die.

"Just because it's not 50/50 service men and service women doesn't mean that it's not getting better. Women now can be sent to the front lines, while they couldn't have been before. It doesn't change overnight.

While women do receive more graduate degrees than men, once you get twenty years beyond that, men greatly outnumber women in the workforce (more in low-income and high-income families than middle-income ones), because women are more likely to drop out of the workforce to take care of a family, and are encouraged to do so, while it's frowned upon or thought of as weird for a man to do the same thing. Being the breadwinner and a stay-at-home parent are both fulfilling roles, but the issue is that it's not a choice for many people, both men and women. Women being more represented in the leadership of companies will allow men to be more represented in the home. In regards to this issue, both parties completely benefit because there is a choice instead of a social obligation."
"Dude Modi should be lauded for this, if nothing else. Fuckerberg was going all over India, there were fucking posters in the streets claiming that his ""free"" internet would help improve farmer education about crops.

"I mean, it's been routinely demonstrated in brain science (as a general domain, so more accurately in subdisciplines like cognitive psychology and behavioral economics) that people are pretty piss-poor on average at forming robust beliefs--politics, in particular, short-circuits a lot of people, and I'd argue it's one of the most prominent realms wherein people assume their opponents are disingenuous or evil. SJWs are a radical and perhaps unique version of this because of their growing social and political capital, but I don't think it's just them doing it.

To the other point, I don't think feminism in its own right dismisses mens' opinions strictly on the basis of sex (or whatever identity). I think its more radical adherents probably do so, but it's worth remembering that a) even accurate beliefs will inevitably have stupid advocates, and b) although this sub constantly feeds us examples of stupid people saying stupid/cringey stuff, we can't confuse the selective showcasing with a probabilistic assertion about what feminists are like. Conceptually, I actually do think there's room to say something like ""all else equal, my prior on the average man espousing an informed and well-reasoned view about X women's issue is lower than it would be for the average woman giving a view about the same issue"". That probability distribution can be updated based on how your observations of people actually go, but I think the prior distribution where feminists want to take men's thoughts on certain subjects with a few more grains of salt is fine (since the counterevidence would be weighted in direct accordance with the sort of thing they expect a man to say)."

"... Which is also not to say that cultural socialization does not also play a part in one's identity/identity formation.

For example: A male-assigned infant/child may very well associate and identify with things typically associated with female-assigned infants/children. And you know what? That's okay, too!

Personal identities/identifications (including non-identities/non-identifications) are e-x-t-r-e-m-e-l-y complex things, and we may never end up getting to the 'bottom' of it all -- and that's alright, too!

It's how we treat individuals regardless of their identity (and/or appearance/existence in the world) that ultimately matters --- and this is where the world of equity and social/identitarian justice comes in.

"I have a different theory. I think that the bigger issue in asia is that most of the countries have more in common than they have different, but they don't WANT to be similar, and so they focus on the differences. Mix that in with the fact that most foreigners can't tell one asian from the next, and I think that culturally pushes the different cultures to try and draw distinctions that might not even be there.

When I lived in japan, if you were black, someone was going to call you Obama, at some point, at least once. So there is also the fact that asian countries don't really have diversity. There is a type of inherent racism, that isn't always conscious, or malicious, but rather just the result of a lack of actual exposure.

Obviously those are just my feelings from living in Japan for three years, and deploying to the Philippines, but it is definitely noticable. When my German fiancee met me in Tokyo, some of the Japanese people thought it was hilarious that an American would get married to a German girl, but they would not have thought twice about it if she was Japanese. I found that fascinating, but like I said. I don't think it is that asians are malicious, it is more like they simply never thought of things that way, and I really kind of get that vibe for all the asian countries.

If asian countries diversified more with each other, I think there would be much stronger diplomatic picture in the area, but diversification is usually very strongly opposed. In japan, it is extremely hard to immigrate and gain Japanese citizenship, and there is not any political momentum to change this, even in the face of certain economic disaster, and population decline."

> Your SO needs to know that it's not them specifically that's causing you to feel this way, but their unwillingness to help you help them.

I think this is something I'll be focusing on with them, I am worried I'll be accused of being ""manipulative"" if I say ""hey this makes me feel really anxious if you don't get meds or go to therapy"" because that has been a response I've gotten before.

But maybe it's all in the way I say it, and usually it's over texting which can be rife with misunderstandings.

What's interesting about the patient/carer dynamic is that they have criticized me for acting like their parent/therapist. And that I ""baby"" them too much. So it's obvious that I find myself falling into this role, which bothers them. Though they do say that they love it when I ""take care of them"" and ""spoil them"" when they feel depressed, but they hate it when I do the same thing when they're manic or I guess fairly middle-ground as well.

I'll be the first to admit, a lot of the things and apprehensions I have against bringing negative thoughts from me to them is my own anxieties on the matter. Early on in the relationship I was not able to communicate those dark parts of me well and they were very unattached and distant because of it. There was some... infidelity-ish things going on and drug abuse at that time as well. But honestly I don't think they remember most of that half of the year, it was a really intense episode.

I actually talked to them last night about how stressed I feel about being tired and sad all the time, and feeling guilty for even going to therapy or considering looking for medication. I told them I wondered if I had Borderline-PD or ADHD / anxiety or depression and that I feel shitty a lot but it's not because of them.

And they re-assured me that they want me to come to them about this stuff as much as possible. In the last... almost a year in our relationship they have really 180'd and became such a better partner and I can tell they love me now. I'm extremely content with them.

But I guess I still am terrified of it suddenly snapping back to the time where they told me things like ""I wish you didn't even like me so I could kill myself and not feel guilty about it"" almost every day. 

Anyway. I might have painted a picture of them like some kind of monster, but they are literally the sunshine of my life and I don't know what I'd do without them. They are a truly amazing person and so dear to me.

"To be honest, I thought this article was pretty poorly written and argued. The actual advice is perfectly reasonable, and I probably follow 90+% of what deMars advocates. But I find his aversion to the exact phrase ""Good Game"" to be strange.

> ""Good Game"" as a Sports Custom

In this section, deMars lodges a lot of complaints against youth sports, but none of them seem to actually say why ""Good Game"" is so upsetting. The examples of opponents saying ""Bad Game"" or ""You Suck"" and the parents being obnoxious and unsportsmanlike from the stands seem to highlight the need for sportsmanship in competition. They are an example of deviations from the normal script which cause players to feel bad, which is where sticking to ""Good Game"" and good sportsmanship helps boosts both teams' feelings.

Separately, he brings up a Mercy Rule game as a point where ""Good Game"" makes ""comically little sense."" However, I think that this is an example where ""Good Game"" is great: the winners show respect even for an outmatched opponent, and the losers likewise show respect rather than assigning blame or being upset. Maybe deMars disagrees with me, but he doesn't elaborate at all.

> Outgrowing “G.G.”

The author then writes a section which basically sums up as: ""Because our parents told us to do this as kids, it has no value as adults and we should move past it."" Rather than explore the motivations that adults have for telling their kids to line up and say ""Good Game,"" deMars rallies against it with such fallacious examples as:

> Not everything we are taught as children remains 100% accurate and applicable when we become more mature and advance into adulthood.

> Can you even imagine if you were still required to believe and practice every single thing you were told when you were six years old?

> “Don’t talk back to adults,” is a good example. You’re not going to get far in life if you are never allowed to disagree with an adult…

DeMars claims that ""Good Game"" is something that is taught to children which can be abandoned as they grow up and understand more complex examples. And he's right: ""Good Game"" is a starting point for good sportsmanship in general.

In the next section, deMars writes:

> The problem with “good game” as a lexical item is that it’s a tilting phrase. When you “G.G” somebody after beating them, it can often tilt them. You’ve already won the round. The least you can do is not compound your opponent’s unhappiness by rubbing it in.

But he still hasn't explained why. And without an explanation of why ""Good Game"" is such a terrible phrase, this argument for good sportsmanship but against players saying ""Good Game"" after they finish games is just bizarre to me."

"> well I know we learned to pray from the prophet, but the ahlul beyt protected it--from what I understand. 

But who do you know that for sure without the science of hadith on your side? The science of hadith allows you to know which hadith is authentic and which is fabricated or weak etc. It's not enough to turn to a cleric from the hawza and say ""he said it's ok"". 

No doubt, ahlul-bait transmitted some things to us from the prophet, but most of the knowledge we have today came from the sahaba. Aisha for instance was with the prophet and taught us many things, including the way he prayed, among other things. 

> actually there is a huge science of checking hadith, do you know about the hawza, people study there for up to 80ish years. do you think they are flat out stupid?

What year did Shia clerics start? 

Ilmurrijal was started by Shu'bah ibn Al Hajjaj who was born in 83H (1350 years ago), and it grew with other Sunni scholars such as Malik bin Anas and Sufyan Ath-Thowri. This is the science that establishes the authenticity of the hadith. Without it, we have nothing. 

> you learn if it's true first by the quran.

The Quran always comes first, yes, but we can't understand the Qur'an without the hadith. It explains the Quran.

> was it the shia leaders who were infallible(prove to me that they are fallible if you can) or mostly fallible men?

In order for you to say they are infallible, you have to provide proof from Islamic scripture. Our belief is that only prophets are infallible, because of proof from the Quran and Sunnah. They can commit small sins as the Quran has informed us, but not the big ones or kaba'ir.

Is there such proof for the imams? 

> where were all those people when hussein was being opressed? 

Those people tried very hard to keep Husain in Madinah. They told him he would be in trouble if he went there. For example, Abdullah bin Abbas and others worked very hard in trying to convince Husain not to go, but he insisted. No one could convince him, he was very persistent. And when the troubel with Husain happened, no one expected he would be killed, because that was not the intention of Yazid nor the state; it was a decision made by a small ruler who was repsonsible for that area (his name is Obaidillah bin Ziad). When Obaidilliah's men reached Husain they insisted he come with them to Obaidillah, and Hsuain refused. Husain asked them for three options: that they would allow him to go to Yazid in Syria (because he trusted Yazid not to hurt him), or they allow him to turn back to Madinah, or that they would allow him to go to a frontier and do jihad until he dies. They refused all three options and insisted he come with them, and then the battle ensued and he was martyred. There were no large groups of Sunni Muslims around him when this happened, and no one expected these evil men to dare and kill the grandson of the prophet anyway. 

With that being said, I have a question: why do you base your whole religion on these things? Bro, Allah completed Islam and he didn't mention Al Husain or his martyrdom. It was tragic but it's not part of the creed of Muslims. Neither Husain nor Ali were mentioned by name in the Quran. These historical stories should not be part of our religion.

> there are stories where imam ali starved so he could feed needy people, where were the muslims when his son was starved and massacred?

The stories about Husain being starved are incorrect. So many things were added to that story to make it more emotional, but we don't go by emotions; we only go by what can be proven from reputable sources. 

Ali starving to feed needy people? It's possible, but we need proof. We know Omar was the first one to do this, but Ali was a great man who feared Allah too. Except that at his time, there had been so many conquests in Syria and Iraq and Egypt (all done in the times of Omar and Othman), so that brought in so much money and Muslims became richer and didn't suffer from hunger like they used to.

"Thank you. One of the reasons I come here is to see all sides. I understand how LDS actions and beliefs appear to others. I try to take those examples and make my self a better Mormon and Christian.

The thing that is frustrating to me, is that many here seem to know exactly what kind of person I am and how much I either do or do not know.

I find many exmos to be just as arrogant and close minded as they claim Mormons to be. Not all, but many."
"Oh God. Where to start.

Okay. So a long while back, a redditor began a subreddit called ""shit reddit says"" which took quotes redditors said and quotes from storm front (a neonazi site) and had a game where we had to guess which was from which to highlight how sexist, homophobic, racist, etc. reddit is.

This person was irritated towards feminists too, and seemed annoyed when people tried to have discussions about the comments he linked to.

He abandoned his sub, and it was taken over by feminists who maintained and strengthened the rule that you could only circlejerk, not have serious conversations. However, these new people also genuinely cared about the shitty things that reddit says.

Whereas the original guy just did screen shots and created a quiz, the new SRS linked directly to threads and engaged in heated arguments in them, downvoting and calling out racism and other problems with reddit, like transphobia. They stopped the quizzes.

As they got more attention, they became more and more militant. The began branding themselves the fempire, ironically comparing themselves to hitler, seeking massive amounts of drama, and basically encouraging people to think horrible thoughts about feminists.

They began banning everybody who said anything counter to the circle jerk. I was once linked there by subreddit drama. In that thread, someone said we downvote everyone. I said, ""that's not true, some of you had good points. I upvoted. I tend to upvote things with content."" I was banned.

They also preemptively banned people who never even commented.

They also have an inability to distinguish if someone is being racist or if someone is calling out racism.

For example, AndrewSmith1986 said, ""The only reason people call Obama a Muslim is that they can't call him a nigger,"" and was heavily downvoted for the n-word, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS CALLING OUT RACISM. I guess they don't like To Kill A Mockingbird either (although, yes, I admit that book could be problematic for focusing on white people rather than black people).

Anyway, they do equally problematic things. They had a picture of Sagan kissing Degrasse Tyson and sold it on coffee mugs, refusing to admit that it was insulting gay people to use being gay as an insult.

[EDIT: I forgot some of the more sinister stuff. I'll start with less sinister and build up.

First, there were accusations of a take-over by Something Awful. They successfully got reddit to ban anyone who posts suggestive photos of any minor. I am actually in support of this ban but most of reddit didn't seem to be. You can ask nitesmoke below me for a recap of the wild SA take-over.

Second, if you are a minority or a woman or whatever, and they have a viewpoint contrary to you, they call you a special snowflake and insult you. The quote about Muslim and nigger can be rephrased to say, ""The only reason SRS calls someone a special snowflake is that they can't call him an Uncle Tom."" You see, if I were to say, ""I am a woman, yet I believe men are treated unfairly by child custody courts,"" I would be dismissed as a special snowflake.

The subreddit has some great points and I have actually noticed a slight decline in heavily upvoted racist and sexist things that escape without anyone commenting in reddit in general.

The subreddit SRSDiscussion is for people who want to seriously discuss feminist topics and is not circle jerky. I actually participate there myself. [Edit: apparently it, too, is over-modded] 

I don't identify as an SRSer because I hate circle jerks, I think they are unreasonable, and I hold many opinions contrary to the hive mind.

However, they have won many drama awards and are frequently mentioned in SubredditDrama. It is almost too easy to find their insane dramatic antics. They are despised by the average redditor, some because they don't like the tactics, some because they would rather not get called out on their shittiness. [EDIT: Their weird tactics also spread to other subs such as r/LGBT, where people now get quickly banned for anything slightly politically incorrect and the mods can't handle any criticism whatsoever.]

"As a white person, shit like this gets me all kerfuffled. It's like, yeah of course not all white people oppose the protests of NFL players, or care about Kaepernick's Nike publicity. Many would likely even support both fervently, if cornered and questioned about it.

"> Honest question, why should Brits learn a second language? 

To be fair, speaking accent-free and slow English would often be more useful. You can spend a lifetime as a English-as-second-language speaker communicating perfectly with other ESLers and then someone throws some rapid Glaswegian or Brummie on you and you have no chance at all.

The hilarious result is that at some international events there are people of 15-2ö nationalities chatting perfectly well with each other in English and the only trouble is with the actual native speakers, English, Irish, Aussies mostly (Americans are somewhat easier to understand due to everybody watching a lot of Hollywood movies). 

For exampel there is this Hungarian music journalist I know who interviewed like a two dozen German or Dutch DJs in English with no problems at all and then a DJ comes from England or Ireland and keeps talking about something that sounds like hice maysuck and it requires considerable effort to figure out it means house music.

So, ideally, I wish British, Irish, Aussie people would learn some Queen's English first and then learn to slow down."
"> Do you really think that the majority of women only like simple games aimed at children?

!? Where do I say that? Pokemon is a wonderful game. It appeals to women. Men, too, but the focus of the reply is to suggest games which have broad appeal to women. Yeah, women play Halo games and whatnot, but I don't find the FPS community as friendly as you seem to realize yourself. If a guy likes Pokemon, then he'd probably have a better chance at getting messages from women dropping a reference to it than he would, say, Virtual On or Border Down.

Given the context of the opener, Darius, and the examples I listed, you should understand that:

""Hardcore"" = challenging 2-D shooters and platformers

""Hardcore"" = high level play in competitive fighters

""Hardcore"" = S-ranks. Low times. High scores in difficult skill games.

""Hardcore"" = import and indie scene

You watch Evo. Thousands of guys. Like three women.
You watch YouTube videos of difficult games, and there are precious few women. Even then, at no point am I saying that women can't or don't play these games. It's just rare. It's unexpected. As I said...

> On the other end, I'd be hard pressed to find a woman willing to play ""hardcore"" games such as DeathSmiles or Trials Evolution for fun.

More women play Pokemon than both of these combined. I'd sooner find a playmate dropping that name than either of the above titles or even more obscure imports and the like."

But the fetus is still alive though. You're not allowed to kill it, you're just allowed to remove it. It dies as a result though which is unfortunate but a price to pay. But abortions should not be taken lightly, the mother HAS to understand that her actions will result in the loss of human life, her child. To rationalize that fetuses aren't alive is in bad taste. 

I've seen women wear shirts bragging about the 7 abortions they've had and they talk about it with a smile on her face. To her mind, she's not letting her living child die, she thinks she getting rid of a mistake. So it could be argued that if the mother is not aware of the consequences of her actions, if she does not understand the weight of her decision, then some say she has not legally consented to the abortion.

"\> Well yeah, Shiki could quickly cross the 15 meter gap, but it seems like you're not considering that Korra can move just as fast, if not faster, in the Avatar state (not to mention her increased reflexes). It's not like she's just going to stand there. Korra can either attack from a height advantage, or use bending to create some distance between the two.

I think you're lowballing Shiki's speed here- she can not only cross 6m and eliminate two of Araya's bounded fields (he specializes in these as a mage, and they have been shown to also act as a form of autonomous defense) simultaneously, she does this with speed that completely nulls Araya's ability to attack with a thought and a fist clench (more efficient than any bending), and takes away the advantage of escape afforded by his skill in spatial manipulation to escape (as shown in the second quote). Korra has not shown simultaneous combat and movement feats on this level.

\>I'm well aware of this. I was just putting it into a way that's easier to understand. There's a small difference between the two, but it's not significant enough to change the outcome.

Wrong, it completely changes the outcome. The way you're putting it is simply that Shiki presses harder in fights, whereas the real difference is like receiving a high enough boost in overall combat capabilities to put her on such a level that if you compared knife-shiki to katana-shiki, knife-shiki would be like a low grunt compared to a highly skilled swordsman. It's like saying Nanaya mode for Tohno Shiki is simply ""Shiki with murderous intent""."
"Yes, I can only say this so many times..

Women invented machiavellianism, men adopted it and refined it as their own natural advantage (physical strength) became outlawed and resulted in social ostracisation.

You see women are natures machiavellians, very few men are naturally apt machiavellians - sociopaths and the related outliers aside. Men have to fucking study/read and practice hard to become good machiavellians, women tend to be born with the skillset although give a chick 48 laws of power and you're only going to help her feed her hypergamy even more.

The difference being that armed with logic a male machiavellian can out maneuvre a female with ease. A womans complementation to her machiavellianism (source of power which aides it) is her sexuality which has an expiry date. A man's complementation is his logic which won't ever die unless he gets a neurodegenerative disease. Men however can also employ sexuality (six-pack abs) and they can also employ fearlessness. Women can employ fearlessness with more difficulty (due to their inherently emotional neural makeup) but it tends to have lesser effects than male fearlessness and conflicts with the power that comes from their sexuality by hurting her sex appeal - fearless women aren't perceived as sexy to most men, but domineering.

Logic can be weaponised and a successful male machiavellian will do so much of time, creating irrefutable assertions and thus dominating social situations to his favour by winning the ""game of credibility""

To conclude: women are natural machiavellians, most women are apt manipulators, most men are not natural machiavellians and most men are suspect to female manipulation, however a man trained in machiavellianism can easily outclass a female machiavellian in the long run as he has more varied complementing sources of power at his disposal and can bend his rationality to be an asset rather than a weakness that women use against him. A trained machiavellian (most males) knows what they are doing and why, they can explain it and adjust it. A natural machiavellian (most females) are just running on a default setting and cannot explain how or why they do what they do, some aren't even aware they do some of the things they do (to get what they want) because it's just nature to them.

Women have to use up their beauty while it lasts or otherwise it's a quick jump over to the feminist movement to try and get what you want and forcibly take from men what you couldn't get by yourselves. Clocks ticking ladies."

And then judges the whole books by the experiences those characters are having.

"I think the ass crack pics and ""anti-female"" attitudes both shed light on how overly sensitive people are in 1st world society. We don't have any real problems in our lives, so we look for random garbage movements to spearhead. 

Both situations are insanity. A guy can show his ass just as a girl can show her breasts, however, don't be surprised if people look at you and/or mock you. Both situations can be easily avoided with proper clothing. Something accessible to all of civilized humanity. (btw: lol to $2000 modern deck and no belt)

The people trying to say MTG scares away women need to realize that it's men that scare away women. The average man is completely different around their friends in private (in comparison to their public life). I'm sure we can agree upon that. Now take men playing sports, card games, hunting, fighting wars, etc... In our element, we will mock other men very harshly, and generally no one is overly offended. This is something literally in our DNA for thousands of years. Men are aggressive, competitive, and generally looking for dominance at all times. Just because we got WIFI in the past 15 years, doesn't mean our DNA has changed.

In conclusion, if women want to do anything around men, they either have a thick skin and competitive drive, or they run off offended. Don't expect men to suddenly reprogram. 

I'm not saying racism, sexism, homophobia, etc don't exist and should be allowed. I'm saying guys will be guys and if you happen to have breasts, we are going to mostly all (hi gay guys) look at them. Some of us are just better at hiding it.

"(forewarning: sorry for the ramble, my hands just kindof spewed this as a flow-of-consciousness deal)

honestly i think this is close, but is a bit constrained a view of functionality of diatonic chords.

(V7->i) is of course a device from the harmonic minor scale (and it's primary cadence), and combined with other tonal minor scales forms the basis of ""minor tonality"" as a whole.

still as you say, V7->i is not a functional resolution of aeolian, however bVII7->i is (V7->vi), and is commonly called the ""deceptive cadence"".

one could say V7->vi is deceptive as it is using the relative dominant, and the primary ""dominant"" of aeolian is actually ii (or iihdim7), and i use the """" as this is really a more subdominant chord, but it functions as a dominant in the way that word is (ab)used due to the tritone.

the primary evocation of a triadic cadence in ionian is well known as IV-V-I, the major sub, major dom (evoking 4-7) and resolving to the major tonic such that the leading tone is contained in the chord directly prior to the tonic resolution (in this case 7 in V).

it's minor equivalent however, is not iv-v-i (well known that the b7 degree in v is weakly resolving to 1, but that's not the true cause) and the V is often (and usually without much more of an explanation that ""because we want a leading tone!"") raised to form a good cadence to i, but this borrows from harmonic minor, is a different scale, and is certainly not native to aeolian, and honestly, is more a sign of the classical overreliance on the V-I meme so heavily used in major.

the minor equivalent of the IV-V-I primary cadence is instead reversed in aeolian: as v-iv-i, such that the triad immediately prior to resolution contains the leading tone: b6 to fall to 5.

Ah! but it falls to 5, not 1, it's not a leading tone (and it goes in the wrong direction!) I won't explain this thoroughly, but the 5th degree of a minor triad is somehow it's ""root"". In a major triad, the top two tones support the root (E and G both belong to C), but in a minor triad, this is reversed. in ACE, C does not support A (C# would, although E does). But instead, both A and C serve to support E. In a similar manner, the iihdim7 (aeolian's counterpart to ionian's V7) is an upside down dom7 chord in the exact same way the minor triad is an upside down major triad.

try playing iihdim7b (second inversion not neccesary, but it puts the 4th degree in the bass for a strong bass resolution) -> i then V7->I. the relative analogy, and plagal/authentic duality between major and minor modes is surprisingly clear on hearing it.

So, at least in aeolian: the plagal cadence is the strongest: exactly the reverse of ionian where the authentic cadence is strongest.

Anyway, after that small digression: I and vi are not the only triads capable of exerting at least some tonic function. iii and IV are also both tonic function in some sense, depending on how they are used. (think v-bVI deceptive cadence in minor), with iii exerting more tonic function with respect to major, and IV with respect to minor, as iii is the primary dominant of minor, and IV the primary subdominant of major, and so those roles are more important in those contexts.

So, at least phrygian and lydian are both capable of supporting a (partial) functional tonic.

this is however not true of mixolydian and dorian as they exert pure dominant and subdominant function respectively.

this is just an extension of the same mechanic that allows one to resolve from V7->vi in major. the vi triad always exerts tonic function, regardless of whether you are in major OR minor, or phrygian, or lydian... i think it's more a question: the type/flavour of tonic function that is felt primary as the home of the tune that determines which you want to go to, and which are stronger.

for example: in a purely major piece that heavily uses the major tonic resolution to become expected, a sudden resolution to vi while at least tonally complete, it somewhat surprising and feels a bit off (hence, deceptive), similarily, one can resolve deceptively in minor to bVI, although that feels somewhat incomplete as it retains its relative subdominant character aswell, you can even treat IV like this in major, if you wanted to describe this by a descriptive name as bVI/vi rather than IV.

there is quite a large amount of functionality (and variable roles) within a single diatonic key with zero chromaticism, and we don't need a chord to be a V7 to be ""dominant"", nor does it need to be rooted on the 5th degree to exert at least some dominant function.

honestly, the only way i know to securely solidify a mode without functionality (and the tonal implications thereof) inherently ""getting in the way"" is to use other techniques, like droning/pedal points etc. the moment the harmony becomes fully dynamic, the functional (and tonal) gravity of the notes themselves inherently start to take hold.

>Functional harmony cadences occur when a dissonant function resolves to tonic.

so, having said all that, my problem with this statement is that functional ""cadences"" as such, are almost impossible to avoid when using any mode of the scale (as honestly, the ""mode"" is irrelevant, simply your resolution target of choice). if you are using dorian, and invoke a B containing chord, then the dorian tonic, which contains F, you have just invoked the sub/dominant functional dissonance, and it is awaiting resolution and if you follow that dorian tonic with ANY triad containing C and or E, it will sound more functionally resolved than Dm did.

i find it impossible to simply say: but there is no function there! this is modal! the function falls out of the scale (just a bunch of notes) naturally. it isn't created or dismissed at will, it forms subconsciously in the mind of the listener. i would even go so far to say as fighting against that subdominant function in your home chord is one of the defining characteristics of pure dorian.

unless you are extremely careful, your dorian tune will end up having a passage that my unintentionally form a cadence to I, vi or even a partial cadence to IV or iii, and undermine ii's homely feel and cause a collapse onto a stronger tonic.

for these reasons, i find pure mixo and dorian particularily unsuited to progressions. without care they very easily collapse into being percieved as being plagal progressions to a different tonic.

sweet home alabama is a commonly quoted example of a mixolydian tune, yet it's progression is clearly V-IV-I, not I-bVII-IV. The final chord is even longer than the other two, further focusing on it as I, even the lyrics suggest it is I. this is what i mean by collapsing to another mode. the primary melody is mixolydian, but it is not harmonised as such, but rather as 5/I, not 1/I. afterall, a mixolydian melody can happily sit above a I, V or iii triad. but i guess this is a different topic of the difference between modal with respect to a melodic mine, and modal with respect to the harmonic progression as a whole.

I'd like to think I'm capable of contemplating all of the depth here. Both the write-up and the study are convoluted, dense, mathematically complex, full of jargon and unexplained special notation. And frankly the study itself is rockin' a good deal of inflammatory condescension. I found it a major turnoff, and am lead to wonder how much of a cherry-picked scenario it is. 

I also would not have swapped the use of candidate last-name first-letters in the study, to political affiliation in your notations. For one thing, there also seemed to have been some combining of candidates that I can't figure out, not sure. That added a level of processing that really ended my willingness to do the math with you.

I had to simply start reading through the data to try to figure out the situation for myself (not a bad result of course but not what most people will do with that). And, I'm spending time I don't have right this second. I will investigate that in the future on my own, and appreciate all this for when that time comes. Grist for the mill is welcome! I'm far from married to any method because frankly I want the best voting method system too.

Personally I LIKE the RV method. I'd be happy using it BTW. My feeling is that more info is better, but that depends greatly on the specific steps used to effect the 'runoffs'.

I remain of the opinion that any alternative method is such an improvement as to make them worthwhile, that using one can be a stepping stone to other methods, and if we hold out for some folks perception of the perfect, we're stuck. But now is the time to hash that all out!"
"Yeah we do. So far Cap has only shown interest in women, same for Tony, Thor etc. suddenly making them bisexual would be forced and not well received. Establish it first or don't do it at all (after like 5-7 movies of them).

Nothing really ignorant about it but I know shippers love to bring this bullshit out so they can make themselves feel better.

They have a right but they force it on people and actually want it to happen which is annoying as hell. Yeah and we know the Russo's were thinking about going with a Nat x Steve romance but quickly disregarded that since it would be typical and its good that they didn't but there is more basis to ship them. Their TWS scenes speak for themselves (btw I'm glad they are just friends).

Who is talking about this sub? This sub doesnt give a fuck about shipping for the most part, reddit thankfully in general doesnt care much. I'm talking about tumblr where Stucky (damm cringeworthy shipping names) is easily more popular and surprise surprise its mostly fangirls (not even actually gay people) who are crazy about that shit.

Btw was a scene about Valkyrie (that showed her interest in women) that they removed it for whatever reason.

And I dont go to tumblr anymore, doesn't change the fact that shippers are obnoxious as hell. It seems like you are a passionate shipper, no need to get so worked up"
"And so if his policies were so good on race relations, why didn't it win him minorities.


Hillary nailed it with comments on implicit bias and administrative issues. Bernie flopped with minorities. It is because he treated it as an issue where minorities are actively discriminated upon. The voting minorities said ""criminal justice reform? I'm not a criminal, the issue is I can't get a job because I go into the interview and see the interviewer immediately remembers Tyrone is a black name"". 


Hillary nailed the bias that minorities feel. Bernie had proposals on the results. Hillary was talking about root cause. They felt understood by one and not the other, and voted accordingly."

"I'm a Hillary supporter I guess. I have supported Bernie far more than Hillary, but since I'm not a passionate #witchHillary member of the circle jerk, I would love to weigh in here.

What she said in those speeches are none of my business and irrelevant to what I think matters. It is a witch hunt and an attack in her trustworthiness. 

Yes I would be interested and release the transcripts. With that said, no one, not even Hillary Clinton has the burden of proof to prove they are innocent. 

I love Bernie, but he has gone off message, broke his positive issue-based campaign promise and is making a lot of implicit attacks on Hillary.

Two points:

1: When his campaign was caught stealing her campaigns info, what did he do? He implicitly accused her of stealing his data (I have no evidence that she did, but I have no evidence that she didn't) then asked for a third party audit to prove she is innocent. On national TV. So that is when the tone changed.

2: Like someone else said, I am not going to demonize the rich and work to divide our party and our country. Not going to happen. I would ask Sanders ""If it is important for us not to alienate and demonize Muslims because we need their help in accomplishing our goals in the middle east, why is it okay for you to alienate and demonize the rich in our own country? Won't we need their help in accomplishing our domestic goals?:

3: To me, this attack is like asking for a copy of all of Bernie's official and private correspondence with socialist/communist leaders/activists to prove he isn't a USSR, Cuba, Venezuela Socialist.

The only evidence we have of wrong doing is the fact that we just don't like Hillary and are looking for her 47% comment, or her Dean Scream or what have you. 

Nothing she could have said in those engagements would vindictive her on the eyes of her detractors and some of her supporters, like me, would not be happy with her capitulating to a demand that is ureasonable and biased.

If Bernie Sanders and Jeff Weaver want to hang their hats on these speech transcripts, then I greatly over estimated what Bernie wanted to accomplish and how he wanted to accomplish it. And I want my money back.

I mean the first words out of his mouth were hammering on this. It's making me lose respect for the ""revolution""...if there still is one.

And sweet god, the real estate guy who pleaded with her really had my sympathies...until he PROMPTLY sold it out as a fundraising moment.

"I completely disagree. Firstly, they have the 'right' to speak about anything they wish. I'll assume that's not exactly what you meant... more that there's sort of a conflict of interest. You could say they speak from a place of privilege, famous-wise, so they can't speak for the rest of us non-famous people.

Still, I disagree. You're doing a lot of comparing. Putting the Green brothers on a ""made it"" pedestal. Putting everyone else in a ""pales in comparison"" category. I suppose that's fine if you personally think that the ""made it"" pedestal exists. I think the point of Hank's video was to say that it doesn't. That ""success"" isn't one kind of thing. It's determined by personal motivation or ambition and can and will change over time. We will all be forgotten, so we're all on an even playing field.

I feel like Hank was encouraging defining your 'success' based on happiness rather than ""making it"" based on fame or economic status or the standards of other people, because all of that will be gone. All you really have is your day-to-day experience and life.

I have no desire to be remembered. Nor do I 'pale in comparison' to the Greens. I will never achieve any of the social accomplishments they have. Not even close. And I would never want to, because that's not how I want to live my life. If I can get to the point where I can lead ""an average, ordinary life with a regular job and invariable routine, planned holidays, an average household...., etc"" That would be incredible and a huge achievement for me. That's relative to my own experience.

If someone is terrified of that, they should do different things than that. But they shouldn't compare themselves to the Greens or anyone else, because again... you define your own success. The universe does not define it for you. Because Success^TM doesn't exist. It's an arbitrary construct.

""We make happiness and we make families and we make sandwiches and... we make ourselves."" This is Hank expressing his values. It seems a shame to find fault with his values simply because his values inadvertently allowed him to achieve other things that you personally think of as ""making it"". 

I believe the ""status"" he has achieved puts him in an ideal spot to discuss such things for all these reasons. Saying that he shouldn't get to discuss such things because of his status seems to be missing the point... at least that's the way I see it."

">My means of production is my brain. Should someone besides myself own my brain?

Seriously? Dude you are smarter than this. Your means of production involve your entire environment. You are not a brain in a vat. That is just r/badphilosophy

>You have criticized capitalism. That is fundamentally different from praising socialism. Please provide some reason to believe that socialism would outperform capitalism in this dimension.

First of all, capitalism/socialism is not an either/or, otherwise the welfare state wouldn't exist. Secondly, even friedman was a socialist to an extent since the UBI is basically a socialist accommodation of capitalism - given that money is a means of production and the UBI/negative income tax is a means of socially sharing that means of production. (edit - isn't it fascinating that this is one bit of friedman's neoliberal economics that hasn't been implemented in our societies yet?)

Finally, the reason I am so adamant that we need to change what is happening is the fact that despite 200 years of industrial and post industrial capitalism we have managed to do many great things, but we still haven't managed to solve our problems vis a vis the global poverty issue (even though capitalism was a massive improvement on serfdom), and we still haven't managed to solve our problems vis a vis fucking up environment - in fact, they've gotten worse. If you look even a little bit into environmental science and its findings, you will be horrified at what we are doing to our own capacity to survive on this planet. The issue is that capitalism - as a system of private transactions, is fundamentally problematic when it comes to dealing with externalities to those transactions like the environment.

Socialism, on the other hand, has no necessary recording process by which to reach a postmodern condition, its only goal is the general well-being of all, which is why it advocates the social ownership of the means of production - so that the wealth we produce is shared more fairly than it is now. Any glance at the massively disproportionate global distribution of wealth and power shows that capitalism is failing to do what Adam Smith intended it to do to - to create a prosperous and equal society. It has brought great prosperity, but it is limited, because unless people's basic needs are met, they are unable to fulfill their potentional. A human being is not an individual, but a social creature. No man is an island. Without the workers the capitalist would produce nothing. And yet they get a pittance for their work, whilst the profiteers rake in millions. None of this is particularly utilitarian as scientific research has shown that wealth only contributes to human happiness to a point at which point other aspects of life become more important. A hypothesis that aristotle postulated 2500 years ago in the nicomachean ethics. Guess what - he was vindicated.

"Linux will only become a viable desktop OS for the average person if a distribution is maintained and invested in by a large company. Esentially what Apple did with BSD. 
Linux desktop users are usually protective and proud of the learning curve they had to endure. As soon as any distribution even approaches being simple for the masses, it's mocked and looked down upon. In any OS comparison thread, a lot of it is Linux users trying to promote the latest most obscure and edgy dist that is now popular amongst the smartest cliques.


Even with Ubuntu on a new laptop a few years ago; to install the WiFi drivers, I had to dig through forums, and type in a list of about 15 commands, and that seemed to be the suggested solution. No bash script file available. I guess because it's less hackery than using a command line input.

The same thing on any other OS would have a batch or bash script available, which you could open up if you wanted to see what it did.


Valve could make a gaming focussed OS based on Linux. If it was easy to use and user friendly, it would be shit on by Linux people though. They don't want normies in their hobby. They're not edgy and intellectually superior enough."

Wakanda seems to be heavily influenced by the western (Nigeria, Ghana etc) and southern parts of Africa (South Africa, Namibia etc).

"Well they would be wrong to infer it. After all, I was not complaining that he would use me as an outlet for his emotional frustration, but rather the contents of his frustration. Like how his parents would not buy him a car even though he would never talk to them even if they were unwell. Like how the university was so unfair to him even though he had cheated in an exam. Like how his best friend who no longer talked to him was a traitor even though he had betrayed him first. Things like that. He had a victim complex. 

> But they're ranting to each other. To sympathetic ears. They aren't broadcasting it to an audience of women. They aren't ranting to their wives and girlfriends about it. They're making a space for themselves to talk about this to each other, not burdening the disinterested.

I mean, toxic discussion is toxic regardless of the audience. Neonazis talking among themselves is still a problem, especially if they get a steady flow of members attracted by aspects of their beliefs. 

I personally don't think the rape movement has gone 'too far.' Is there some collateral damage..? I guess? Some people might be getting falsely accused. But yeah people who say you should believe the woman no matter what... They have a point. It's incredibly difficult for a woman to come up and say that she's been raped. She wouldn't d it unless she had a good reason to. But that said, I think there should be a case and everything and evidence shown to support the man's case that he didnt rape. 

The good thing about all these movements is that it's changing society and women are actually coming forward and talking about their experience now. Men too, boys who were raped are talking about it a lot more. It's doing a lot more good than bad which is why feminists get upset when MRA takes a hostile stance towards things like metoo.

I mean a lot of those insults aren't exactly shaming them for not being manly. Most of them are shaming 'losers.' You could direct the same insults (but tailor them for women like a neckbeard equivalent) and it would be the same. If you aren't participating properly in society (as an adult with a job who contributed, has friends, romantic partners, etc.) you will be mocked - male or female. I don't agree with it, and I dont agree with gendered insults, but I dont agree with your point either.

"|...they are complete assholes when it comes to business, and I hate them for it.

I see this as the basis for the cognitive dissonance, and also the reason you are being singled-out and called names (unfortunately). Their business practices are one of the first things people think of when they hear ""Monsanto"". In my opinion, these practices also severely disrupt the research they could be doing. By being over-protective of their market niche, they are halting innovation.

So subconsciously, people who read your comments defending the technology (which intuitively comes second to their tyrannical business model) assume you have no problem with the company.

That really ties back to the tone of your writing and how you structure your arguments; you tend to avoid empathizing with the hatred people feel towards Mega-Ag (tone), and you generally divorce business practices from the technologies we're discussing (structure).

Doing so is objective and scientific (I'm guessing you've done your share of research papers), but in just about any public forum, you're going to attract a lot of Flak. I hope you see my point.

Rhetoric aside - you bring up a lot of good points. I can see how it would be easier to treat animal waste, and there we run into the same problem that we have when trying to confront Monsanto - unified corporate and lobbyist front with an eye solely on the bottom line. Again, another reason people don't have a lot of patience for being criticized about the details of the technology.

As for ""natural"" gene lines, since they patented their own gene lines, they could utilize the selected tendency to take over other gene lines as a means for litigation against farmers who did not want to be owned by Monsanto. Thankfully, it does look like that is coming to an end due to some Anti-Trust laws being brought to the surface.

Here we run into the issue of divorcing practice from technology. You are looking at the GMO tech from a very scientific viewpoint, which is good. However, you have to understand the subjective side to all this. People look at this issue first see the corporate abuses, the power-mongering, the patenting of life, and so by the time they are able to look at the technology, they are already in a negative frame of mind.

It is understandable, no? Why believe Monsanto and other companies about the viability and safety of GMOs when they have already gone out of their way to be vile, power-hungry, greed-ridden asshats? Any credibility of GMO science is severely diminished, and despite my background in Geoscience and Ecology, I find it difficult sometimes myself.

TL;DR: You bring a lot of valuable information to the table, but you're dampening the influence of it by limiting the scope of the picture to the technical details. Most people are not patient enough to ascertain this about you, given the volatile nature of the topic.

"Yes I could, sorry. What happens is that the state controls society, and people that happen to own/work for corporations get power from the state.

You have congressmen that desire money, and so they turn to the corporations to pay them to do what they want. Think of mercenaries and merchants scheming to do evil upon others. The mercenary isn't a puppet of the merchant, and neither is the merchant a puppet of the mercenary. However, between both, the mercenary holds real power (violence), while the merchant relies on the desires and fears of the mercenary to get what he wants. The mercenary can always take what he wants by force, so whatever it is that stops him comes from his own mind. Perhaps he can't produce by himself, perhaps he feels honorable trading with the merchant, etc etc etc."

> As a man, I can acknowledge some aspects of masculinity displayed by many men (not you or I) is ""toxic"", and I don't feel the need to discredit the choice of phrase

That is a fantastic choice that you are free to make but, respectfully, I only feel that need because I think the phrase itself is why there is always a ""NotAllMen"" pushback. I've been around this discourse for a while now so I understand that ""Toxic masculinity"" doesn't actually mean ""All masculinity is toxic"". For the layperson though, it needlessly complicates the issue and is why you get responses like the one demonstrated by the Carlton coach in the article. So instead of people going ""yeah they're right, I know a fair few men that are complete dickheads and need to be pulled into order"" their first response is ""hang on, why is my masculine identity suddenly wrong"" and the resistance is immediate. Ultimately, every social movement needs to make it's messaging clear and I think the observation that barely any ground has been made on these issues ( despite the increased discussion, sharing of experiences and open dialogue facilitated by social media) shows there is something off-base with how people are trying to reach, communicate to and ultimately change men.


>These unhealthy attitudes are exclusive to men, so to say it isn't a masculine trait is just wrong.

"Part of that is what the taxpayers demand, though. (Disclaimer: I'm a government worker, but not for DoD.)

Set anti-government prejudice aside for a second and think about it. The government (especially the United States gov.) is held to much higher standards than any individual private company. Private CEO holds emails in his private account? No one cares. Someone dies on a private job? Send in OSHA, but it won't warrant news coverage. Several people get injured or killed at work? Maybe a page A-8 news article. Maybe. 

Curious about particular events at any private workplace, and put in a request for documents? ""Lol, fuck off or get a subpoena."" Curious about government operations? Submit a FOIA. You don't even need a reason, you can just request ""All documents related to V at site W facility X from Dates Y to Z."" They take forever, may be denied or redacted...but you'll get a response eventually. And then can ask again. And again.

My point is, the government knows that any single thing it does can be inspected by the general public at some point, with or without context. And as such...it's very careful about the things it does. 

Could you imagine if the gov. told an employee who had concerns about safety, ""Do this job, or I'll fire you and find someone who will."" ? Because I promise you that that absolutely doesn't happen. If anyone has a concern for any reason even just an observer who has no contextual information about the situation can stop work, and cause a lengthy stop, reevaluate, and start up process. 

And in the event of a FOIA request - all of that will be available. The meeting minutes and planning emails from months or years before the project started. The engineering evaluations on the plans and subsequent modifications. The QA inspections on those grade 8 bolts you ordered from a specific manufacturer because they're able to provide pedigree on the metal and manufacturing of those bolts, unlike some of their competitors who try to slip in the occasional Chinese counterfeit. The science studies they commission on a particular lot of those bolts to provide a secondary check on the manufacturers work, to ensure that the bolts provided are in fact, grade 8 bolts. 

And god forbid any mistakes happen during any of those processes, or there are inconsistencies in the paperwork, or some of the paperwork is missing - the conspiracy theorists go nuts. Here's a good example minus details. 

Someone maintained on on-site office. But absolutely never spent any time there. Always traveling around the states on business, he spent maybe 2 weeks in that office quarterly. But that wasn't always the case, at one point he was doing research into the history of a process, and requested some of the record paperwork from the period - basically an internal FOIA request. The vast majority of it was irrelevant and ended up returned, but he was interested in a portion that he held onto to work with at the time. Ended up traveling, doing other work. Forgets about the logs on his bookshelf. Years later, is finally told to clean out the office he never uses the next time he's back, and he does. Most of the stuff on the shelves is just personally made references, procedures in binders. Printed, self organized stuff. He's busy, so he just ends up tossing it all in recycling. 

Fast forward a year and a half. Someone has submitted a FOIA request for the ""lot"" (literally, lot, as in there are so many records that they come together in ""lots"") that the subset of records he had kept, were a part of. And in verifying those records before giving a copy to the requester, realized that a small subset of sections were missing. So they came to the original requester - who was no longer there - and did interviews of everyone around to see what they remembered. The company he worked for still worked for the government, and he still worked for that company, just not at the same site. The finding was made, that he had tossed those records out when he cleaned out his office. (Why the hell the records division had turned over ""originals"" to someone instead of making copies and turning those over caused a QA person to practically have an aneurysm.) Six months later his company fired him for the mistake, despite the fact that it had happened years ago, and was entirely an innocent mistake.

It was, to quote our illustrious VP: ""A Big Fucking Deal."" But such a tiny, tiny thing in the scheme of things. The answer we have to give comes down to ""We accidentally lost it,"" which gets reported as ""GOVERNMENT COVERS UP ACTIVITIES"". If it was a private company, the press would just at most say, ""suspiciously missing.""

So yeah, the total cost of the bolt might be $27.00 - but there's a reason. Not that that excuses DoD. They're the only branch that never has to answer to an audit. "

"So, this is the crux of the matter:

""And as a rational person you undoubtedly know how fallible this type of ""evidence"" is.""

There has been a lot of ""science"" over the years that has been accepted as fact and then proven to be completely wrong. The common demoninator in all that bad science has been on thing, people. You have said that God, by definition, cannot exist because he violates the laws of physics. I would say that nothing can exist that defies the laws of physics but the problem is, we don't know what the laws are. 

My favorite current bad science is the assertion that nothing can go faster than the speed of light. While it might be true, my position is that accepting that as fact when we've barely even left our planet is utter nonsense. I'm no scientist, I'm a mechanic so the science on this might be solid and I might be all wet but my logical brain says I'm pretty much on the money. I remember when I was a kid that there was a debate about the makeup of the internal structure of the planet. That might be settled now, I don't know but like with the new spiders, we haven't even figured out everything about the stuff we can phsycially touch yet we're making statements of fact about the laws of the universe? I don't think anyone has really even come up with a good definition of life itself when you can see it everywhere. 

So, this would actually seem to bear out your statements about how hinky personal experiences can be but what I would say is that accepting one guy's opinion on something because he has used some form of science to justify it and dismissing another because he uses faith or simply personal experience is kind of silly. I understand the scientific process but people make a lot of money on a daily basis by fooling a lot of people, hell, it's pretty much how our political system works. 

This is an important point:

""in practice there are some among us who just can't seem to function without a comforting and/or simple superstitious belief. They can't be expected to grasp the complexities of morality, and can't come to terms with things like death on their own.""

I agree with that, it's one of the things religion does and does well. I get a lot of praise for my technical skill but we all have our places and our strengths and weaknesses. I can take the Internet apart and put it back together but if you held a gun to my head and forced me to create a piece of music, I'd be one dead honkey. I don't need any of that stuff but some people do and I don't have a problem with that. Religion is used to justify evil but so is peanut butter, it doesn't mean we're going to be able to get rid of either one or that they aren't important and useful in some cases. What's rational and meaningful to you is hogwash to someone else but how boring would it be if we were all the same. 

Believe me when I say I understand where you're coming from, I hope I've helped you to see my point of view a little in return."

Sure they have interests they lean towards more than others and that should be encouraged, but I agree with OP’s concern that watching feminized shows where women are fulfilling traditionally male roles is not healthy.

I knew this text already. It was posted on several forums for discussion. Here's some feedback for you from some user who is not me, but with whom I share my opinion:

""To be clear, I did not post the above because I agree with the author. In fact, I am embarrassed for him in his defensive, seething posture and read in his words a panic after seeing his sacred cow led to the slaughterhouse. His is a religious indignity, going so far as to say that anyone disagreeing with him is less conscious and enlightened than himself and anyone with whom he agrees, an obvious ""no true scotsman"" fallacy. While a relevant counterpoint, it's overflowing with contradictions, showing no end to the mental gymnastics and cognitive dissonance he is willing to suffer to defend what was not actually attacked in the first place. He even refers to the ""emotional prejudices of materialists"" with seemingly no appreciation for the hypocrisy in his position.

This text is however useful in illustrating certain biases against a measured analysis of mental phenomena. It's the same sort of reaction you see to research into consciousness in general, which is an underlying assumption that rational explanation invalidates subjective experience. It's the same for people who read Sartre or another existentialist and only understood the part about the absence of intrinsic meaning, totally missing the necessary conclusion that a lack of intrinsic meaning liberates one and allows one to create meaning as they see fit. ""Random noise"" has a huge part in everything as we know it, from quantum fluctuations to psychic disturbances providing novel insights or at least the thrill of a momentary suspension of one's narrow reality tunnel. Without entropy, which is disorder, there would be no universe as we know it.

To ring in the new year, I vaporized 50mg of DMT as the clock struck midnight and found myself face to face with alien insectoid creatures dancing elaborately, a dance that kept all of this presumably subatomic activity I saw in sync and the universe (which universe, I'm not sure) running smoothly. It was, as one would expect from DMT, utterly astounding. But I'm not going to start putting down others as unenlightened because they aren't hip to alien bugs doing the watusi with electrons. The experience was neither trivial nor objectively true, in my view. There was a distinct impression of intelligence among these beings, as well as the characteristic intention to communicate with me, but it's also possible to stimulate certain parts of the brain with electricity to consistently produce the sensation of the presence of an entity of some sort. The experience itself is authentic, for there is no such thing as a false experience, but there is nothing open-minded about turning the unusual into an unquestionable truth.

Biology and psychology can show us certain biases to the conclusions we draw from our experiences. I've noticed people often have visceral reactions to someone pointing out the finer details of how aspects of the psychedelic experience occur, quite similar to a religious fundamentalist. At the heart of things, people are often afraid that if they shine the light too directly on that which seems most important, they will find that there was nothing active there at all. Never mind that any light you shine will always be reflected back to you. As Frank Herbert so eloquently stated, fear is the mind killer. There may be something there after all and maybe it is stranger than even the goofiest kook likes to imagine, despite it fitting easily within a scientific framework. Anyone who sees scientific explanation as simplifying phenomena has willfully resisted the true complexity that unchained curiosity reveals. The problem is that vague ideas seem complex to those who do not truly explore them, for when an idea has no clear boundaries it is easy to imagine that it goes on forever.

But at least the author has convinced me of one thing: James Kent's book may be worth reading if it can piss off a devotee this much.""

It felt like to me based on the tone of what she was writing, that she had no sympathy for people in these situations, and honestly, I don't think that refusing to show sympathy towards people discussing their issues and pain, should be celebrated.

She clarifed of course that she wasn't trying to be dismissive, so I likely was just being uncharitable in my reading.

Also, how about you stop implying things and come out and say it. Why is it so interesting that it set me off?"
"> porting Minecraft between similar languages is completely unfeasible

Re-writing Minecraft in C++ wouldn't be a port. It would require completely re-writing the game engine, which itself is integrated into the actual game of Minecraft itself, making things that much more of a pain in the ass. Furthermore, Java and C++ are not similar languages. Do you understand what memory allocation is? Nameplates? Pointers vs references?

> They would have to reuse many of the same icons to make the brand recognizable

Asset re-use is nothing new to game design. Furthermore, they could easily refine the current assets at higher resolutions. The vanilla textures look like shit.

> they can't add a bunch of crazy new features.

If they're making the sequel from the ground up, why couldn't they?

> Taking out the interpreter, though, and straight compiling the game would significantly increase it's CPU performance, which would allow for some changes.

The fact that you think you can just ""take out the interpreter"" from Java indicates to me that you're speaking out of your ass. Java depends on the JVM. You can't just ""take it out"". You also can't ""straight compile"" Java. Again, they would need to completely re-write the game in C++. At that point they might as well create a sequel, considering they would have to re-write so many portions of the code in addition to converting it to C++. This would be on top of having to actually understand what the hell is going on inside the code and determining what can and cannot be salvaged.

Edit:

"I've never been good with small talk (part of why I'm going to grad school either this or next year). Get nervous and I can be awkward. I'm very technical when discussing my role, but that also leads to confusion.

Could be that I'm too technical and people interviewing me aren't...

BUT sometimes I try to simplify the conversation and I can then tell they ARE technical. I try to match their skill level to how I describe what I do. Maybe my body language conveys something odd when I do talk that doesn't happen on the phone,,.?

"> Hmm, I didn't detect any elitism from the author.

Was on my phone at the time, at home now so it'll be easier to explain what I mean. First off, the term ""anti-gunner"" or ""anti"" is stupid. It oversimplifies a viewpoint just as as ""gun nut"" does. I understand what he means by using it, and most of his readers won't see the problem with it. That's because most of his readers already agree with him. If he really wants to convert people, he should think about what readers who disagree with him will think. Starting off the article by using a label puts people on the defensive and less open to new ideas.

Secondly, phrases like this:

> So there I was in a room full of her highly educated friends who don’t know the first thing about ballistics or how to clean their own game.

So? What does knowing about ballistics or cleaning their own game have to do with any of this? You don't need to have any experience with either to support firearm ownership. That phrase serves no purpose other than to show how he is better than the professors at that party.

Addtionally, the exchange between him and the history professor is full of ""emotional"" language. Does the reader really need to know what kind of drink the professor has? Or is it there to paint the professor as one of those dreaded intellectuals?

> His experiences seem to be what I encounter from the anti's all the time. Calling them out for using emotional and logically flawed arguments isn't elitist.

Yes, it is, if you're going out of your way to do it. In a forum about proposed gun legislation? Have at it. At a party for your wife's colleagues? Less appropriate. Also, don't make the mistake of thinking that the ""pro-gun"" side cant be similarly emotionally charged. Even this article is. But, emotion doesn't immediately invalidate a viewpoint, and it is important in its own right. We are human beings, after all, and we need to balance both emotion and reason. One without the other is flawed.

The author also goes out of his way to cite facts that support his viewpoint, but draws false conclusions. For example:

> Before long I’d be firing facts at him about how, when you compare FBI crime statistics with gun-ownership rates and sales figures, you find that more guns equal less crime.

Correlation v. causation. Both occurred at the same time, but that doesn't mean that one necessarily caused the other. It does tell us that more guns does not equal more crime, which is a very important and convincing conclusion, but there is a distinction there.

> I thought the article gave a different perspective on debate with those opposed to firearms, and made some good points on not just winning, but also making your opponent think about their position.

Yes, it's not just about winning. However, he only covered half of it. The other have is making yourself think about your opponent's position. The point of a discussion over differing opinions isn't to ""win"", or show the other person all the ways they're wrong, or even to try to convert the person to your point of view; it's to find a mutual understanding. Rather than trying to show people how they're wrong, show them that you're a decent person. That'll go further than facts because, as much as we might like to deny it, humans are emotional beings and will get defensive instinctual when challenged. And when people are defensive they get closed-minded and dismissive which gets nowhere.

tl;dr I'm not saying he's wrong, I'm saying how he approached it is wrong. In the end, I just want people to think about what they're doing and saying. Don't treat someone who disagrees with you as an opponent, or they'll do the same. Let's try to break down the barrier with hospitality rather than slamming data at them. Let's just be decent humans to each other."
"Actually, yes. The concept of patriarchy doesn't say that ""all women are victims"" and ""all men are predators."" It says that society manufactures genders stereotypes that disenfranchise people based on their gender.

Yes, most often we hear about how the patriarchy leads to things like sexual harassment against women (because society treats women like sex objects), or women being discounted in the workforce (because men are supposed to be the bread winners, and women stay home and have babies). But there are other sides to it, too.

For example, if a man has ever been told that his interests are too feminine, that's the patriarchy pushing a role on him. If a man has ever been told to ""man up,"" that's the patriarchy assuming that only women can be emotional, and, therefore, it's wrong for a man to show emotion. The patriarchy cuts both ways.

The patriarchy disenfranchises women by implying they're meant primarily for motherhood. But it also disenfranchises men for implying they're only meant to make money for their wives and children. Just like the patriarchy makes it hard for women to be in the workforce, it makes it hard for men to be stay-at-home dads.

In this case, because society insists that men are always dominant and interested in sex, these boys aren't being viewed like the victims they are. Because attractive women ""should"" be sex objects, this woman isn't being treated like the pervert she is.

I know you meant your post as a joke: but it's actually correct.

The patriarchy gets a bad rep, because people assume it's only about women. When you study the concept, you realize that—despite what YouTube insists—its proponents are also interested in helping men."

Overall I genuinely believe that they're just trying to get a rise out of you. 9 times out of 10 it's the minority that gets picked on, women generally are the minority on most forums. My advice to living through internet commenting is pick your battles wisely, be smart about where you choose to fight these battles, don't feed the trolls (some people don't care what it is, they just want to fight. They'll go after anything whether it's race, gender, IQ, orientation), don't single yourself out to the wolves (being female usually makes you the minority in most forums, and trolls will go after the odd one out relentlessly), don't always try and have the last word. When some asshole is following me around with harassment, I've found completely ignoring them makes them lose interest.. most of the time. One guy actually went after me over a stupid disagreement with a fake login page a few years back(first and only time falling for this), stole my password and wrecked alot of my personal internet stuff. It's shitty, but it happens to everyone!

Probably the best alternative theory I have seen is the loop theory but that wouldn't explain things like the people behind eva claiming that the Soryu to Shikinami name change was important to the plot or the relevance of the tape recorder progressing beyond the track Shinji usually listened to when the plot started deviating significantly from NGE, although I can definitely imagine them going with the loop plot. I'd certainly put the continuation theory much lower on the fanwank scale than most other theories that rely on a tonne of assumptions usually based on a single detail overly focused on and fanwanked to fit everywhere.

It is clear you know a fair amount about the Bible and Christianity, so I'll try to just mention a few points, hopefully with tact and charity, as I don't want to be a clanging symbol. But like you, I'm glad to defend the Bible and argue Star Wars in the same post. :)

> You say ""the"" wrong side of Pascal's wager as if there's only one.

Agreed; I just couldn't resist referencing Pascal's Wager, though, since you mentioned ""doubling down"" in /r/TrueChristian. My reference was intended mostly for amusement rather than serious theological challenge, but I did want to mention it because of what is at stake based on your choice of belief: your soul.

> Wikipedia has [Quirinius] campaigning up north in Cilicia and Galatia between 12 and 1 BC.

Agreed again, although it is entirely possible he was entrusted with temporary control of the region during the census given that the actual governor at the time, Varus, was so inept. Because Luke was so accurate in the dozens upon dozens of historical facts he mentions in Luke/Acts, I have no problem giving him the benefit of the doubt in this verse, especially because he used the word hegemon not legatus indicating the potential for Quirinius governing in a lesser capacity at that time.

> [Daniel] has [Antiochus] attacking Egypt again and dying in Syria, which never happened. The fact that it's accurate about him up until this point is one of the ways we know that it was written later than it claims.

Thank you for agreeing that Daniel 11:1-35 is entirely accurate about Aniochus! But for verses 36-45, perhaps I wasn't clear when I mentioned the importance of Biblical prophecy being twofold: near-term and long-term. Verses 1-35 are the near-term prophecy, and verses 36-45 are the long-term prophecy, and we can have confidence that is the case because it's what Jesus said.

Regarding your mention of the passage where God spoke with Moses, here are one or two descriptions of how God's providence works in this kind of scenario.

I can understand desire to understand why Christians don't agree with you that ""God is a monster"" based on the excerpted passages from Numbers etc., and I can assure you that understanding the Bible fully can give a Christian perspective that God’s character is full of love and mercy and grace. Perhaps I could interest you in an atheist's critique of Dawkins' version of Christianity (I really enjoyed reading this), or a Christian's critique to help give you insight into the Christian perspective.

There are many books written on the Trinity, but I don't think you'd be interested in them at this time given your reply on that topic. :) I'd disagree that Lewis supported partialism, but I'm not looking for a debate on it.

• I appreciate your acknowledging that Qui-gon's perspective on the force is, in your words, ""unique"". That agrees with my point that Qui-gon's words were contradictory to Yoda's words in the OT (Original Trilogy).

• You're correct that the Rogue One transmission was made to another ship, and the cartridge was physically carried to Tantiv IV. That Vader was trying to stop the cartridge from being physically transferred says, to me, that Vader's first priority would be finding the cartridge, and that his accusation should have been ""a cartridge was smuggled aboard this ship."" And I also agree Leia was clearly lying, but to me it doesn't follow that she would have even made up a story about a diplomatic mission, as clearly her ship was just in a giant space battle and couldn't possibly have been on a diplomatic mission...

There’s not much for me to add to the R2/Chewy bit since you basically agreed with what I said, just are choosing to accept what, to me, is incredibly unlikely given the evidence. And while I appreciate the offer, biology discussion is not my thing...

"> I'm not sure that anyone is being forced to sell products or provide services against their will? 

I agree, I was just using that as an example. When the whole ""bakery owner refuses to sell cake to gay couple"" story popped up a few years ago, people were rightly outraged, but supporters of the bakery owner piped up with arguments that the only other alternative would be to force that bakery owner to make the cake for that gay couple instead, and I was saying that, bigotry aside, I begrudgingly admit that people should maintain a right to discriminate as they so choose.

I've likened this situation a little bit to the EPA - it was obviously unlikely that many people would get on board with a restriction on certain practices (pollution), but society deemed the issue to be of particular importance, so they acted. I think the public opinion on sexual orientation is drifting towards establishing it as a protected class, and I feel like it certainly will be within the near future. I'm suggesting that once it does get to that point, it would seem prudent and fair to incentivize non-discrimination in such a way, since some people are effectively subsidizing a business they can't shop at. 

Also, while I understand your apprehension at how willing the population would be to accept this as a standard, I'm curious how you view similar acts - like the illegality of discrimination in workplaces.

> Second problem: The practicality of this solution. There is none.

I've realized a similar issue in thinking about how this problem would be addressed. However, while I like how you phrased why it would be difficult to quantify the importance of free society in assessing value to subsidies lost, could you not make the claim that the fact that a person could be subsidizing a business they can't patronize is a clear, obvious problem, and that it wouldn't be unreasonable to say it should jeopardize any and all business-friendly subsidies they might otherwise receive? Secondly, how are other instances of illegal discrimination monitored for compliance? Would the infrastructure be all that different?

> I would not want a willfully discriminatory business to benefit in anyway from any public funds. That would include road access, education, water, power, participation in chambers of commerce, publicly funded internet initiatives, etc, etc

I certainly understand, but would you not agree that the two situations are different? I mean, a business could discriminate against me for any reason, while at the same time collect taxpayer-funded subsidies, using my tax dollars, to directly benefit themselves. If a business owner didn't contribute at all to public infrastructure then I would agree, but if they are equally paying the road, and I'm not barred from using the road, then I'm not affected by their discrimination in the same way - or even at all, right?

"Since we're focusing on problems, I'm not going to push why she was good. Presumably, you're already able to make those arguments. Additionally, I'm going to try and avoid ""whaddaboutism"". That said, my apologies for the length.

>She was strongly against marriage equality right up until it was politically impossible for her to be.

I was politically aware over most of that period - and went from expressing homophobia as a teen, to realizing it for the poison it was and then condemning it, around the same time - so from my perspective, the switch from ""political suicide"" to ""politically normal"" happened pretty fast. The way I remember it, and I might be wrong, was that the Clintons came into office pushing for gays serving openly, got throttled, tried to compromise with DADT, and then then Gingrich pushed a veto-proof DOMA across his desk. In 2000, I remember being shocked that Hillary was pro-civil unions (which led to a pretty difficult discussion with a few of my dorm-mates who were kind enough to explain the facts of life to me). Then, in 2006, she advocated for states allowing marriage equality. In short, she wasn't at the bleeding edge, but at worst, she stayed out of the way, and at best, she was an advocate. Considering that's about how long it took myself and a good portion of my cohort (much less older folks) to do the same, I can't bring myself to hold that against her.

>She called young black men ""super predators that need to be brought to heel.

Vile comment, and in support of vile legislation. Mind you, crime was destroying us (i.e. NYC, other cities), and - what I've read and had explained to me - the policy was advocated by multiple stakeholders, including representatives of black communities from multiple cities. 

But... that doesn't make it right. Moreover, once it went on the books, it stayed on, long, long after it should have been repealed and denigrated as the vicious, profit-driven, industrialized brutality that it became. She did admit to all this, and did work to fix what damage was possible to fix, but that doesn't heal a fucking thing when it comes to the lives destroyed by the 90's backlash against the crack/lead epidemic. The 1994 Crime Bill was just bad. Mind you, look at who, and how many folks voted for it. It'll help illustrate how fucked political thinking had gotten at the time.

>She backtracked on supporting single payer after insurance companies paid her to give a speech at one of their events.

I thought she backtracked in the 90's after the insurance companies and Gingrich handed the Clinton administration their own asses. It's been a rocky road, and there have been setbacks, but both Clintons have pushed it over the years. If she was President, we might not have gotten all the way to universal single-payer, but at least we'd be closer to it.

"> It is when (usually men) explain something unnecessarily to demonstrate their own competence, without taking into account the background or competences of their conversation partner. It has been argued that it comes from different social patterns that men and women engage with amongst themselves. If a man presents a problem to another man he wishes to (a)know he is talking to the right person (b)have his problem fixed. So his conversation partner will try to demonstrate his ability verbally to reassure him on the matter of (a) before engaging in (b). 

Here's the thing. There is already a gender neutral word for this behavior: Patronizing. 

And the very nature of the word is sexist towards men. Kind of ironic how its popularly used by women, particularly feminists, considering one of the major problems they fight against is sexism against women. So it essentially becomes a classic adding fuel to the flame scenario.

>Women on the other hand try to make sure they understand the requirements of the conversation before doing anything, as they often talk for no particular reason or share problems for reasons other than getting them fixed. So a women will first try to get all the information she need out of her conversation partner and then develop an appropriate response. Listening might be all that is required for example or reassurance that the other is already on the right path to solving the problem themselves. They would rarely try to verbally demonstrate competences, unless it is specifically required from the conversation and even then attempt to not ""loose"" the other person. They would rather make themselves look less competent but give their conversation partner the feeling they've solved the problem together, then alienate them.

"Hey everyone. I know this will be probably get buried, but this seems to be something I can't say on Ghazi. I likely won't be able to go back after this, but I'm fairly comfortable with that now.

I'm really not someone important, but I was vociferously against the comments that Sarah made on Ghazi. Like this woman, it was because of my personal experience helping a close family member recover emotionally and mentally from a pedophile. I said that I was willing to listen to her response, and give her the benefit of the doubt depending on what she said.

It's been a few weeks, and I've been reading her response as well as the response of other figures, and decided that I can't easily stay silent on the subject. I understand her point that she was young and foolish (though 20 seems a bit old to be -that- foolish). However, I noticed something conspicuously absent from her statement; an apology. There was a lot of excuses as to why she's not responsible, but no admittance that they were her words, and that they (and her actions) hurt people. I've been even more disgusted with the response from other ""anti"" figures, who have easily hand-waved her words away.

That's why I've decided to back away from Ghazi, and mostly from the whole debate. Frankly speaking, I disagree with you guys here on most everything. I've seen no evidence that Gamergate is actually about ethics. I think that the representation of women in gaming is a problem, both in terms of women in the actual games and female developers. I also think that situation will improve over time, as the traditional ""boys club"" disappears into more accessible forms of gaming (mobile, whatever). I also think that some of the things that those claiming to be part of Gamergate have done is disgusting.

However, these last two weeks have made me realize that ""my"" side isn't a bed of roses either. That there are those doing equally as disgusting things, things I absolutely can't condone, and they are being supported by prominent members of the anti discussion. Maybe I'm not as aggressive in my stances as some Ghazi members, but there are times where I also find myself disagreeing with their ideas on how and where to support social progress. In addition, I feel as though the absence of full-throated support for every idea that the group supports is viewed as some sort of betrayal on Ghazi. I fear that the more extreme Ghazi, radical side of the discussion is every bit as damaging to discourse as your's. Maybe that's why I can't stay there, or support many of their ideas anymore.

Anyway, thanks for reading my rant. I really just needed to get that off my chest. I can't in good conscience wish you all good luck, but I do hope that something positive comes out of this cat fight. Most of the time I despair that anything will."
"Yea, you're right, but isn't a big part of the problem that the police force in the US is lacking and needs to be larger?

To me it seems that it would make more sense to begin in that end, and not actively ban every single gun, but tighten up the law of gun ownership while simultaneously upgrade the police forces.

But as you say, most gun violence incorporates hand guns, and when it comes to self defense a hand gun makes more sense than a shotgun or AR, so why should a citizen realistically own an AR?
Even when it's limited to semi only and 5 round magazine, the weapon type just doesn't make any sense privately owned, but again, I'd love to own one myself because I like guns but understand why I can't."
">i've been playing this game for years and not once have i heard it referred to as meta crystal.

Glad to hear it. Did you poll the entire Smash community for that?

(especially since I doubt discussion of an unplayable stage comes up in competitive THAT often)

You already know about the Smash Wiki (which admittedly isn't updated very often), but [how about this video with over 100,000 views, where no commenter is questioning the video's title - (though a few people are calling it by the name Metal Cavern)?]( http  Or the Mario wiki, which correctly notes that the stage was officially named that in Japan, but has no official name in English? And this gamefaqs thread has some pretty silly arguments as is the gamefaqs way, but nobody seems confused over the name of the stage.

I suppose I don't have any proof that people on this sub don't have a vendetta against you (just like you don't have any proof people DO have a vendetta towards you), but I'll leave you with three things to ponder on.

1. When a comment gets downvoted to the point where it's hidden (which isn't very much, iirc), the only people who click on the comment to check are going in with the mindset that it's a bad comment already - so they're more likely to downvote. I guarantee that at least a couple of the people who downvoted The Battlefront II Comment didn't really understand what was going on and had never heard anything bad about EA before.

2. I'm willing to bet that if you made an alt account with a completely different name and icon, you'd still get downvoted just as often (assuming you didn't change the way you commented).

3. Calling the people who downvoted you the ""typical stupid hivemind"" doesn't make them any less likely to downvote you. And you think you aren't being abrasive?"

"You're still conflating two different arguments. ""X is a hero"" does not imply ""Not-X is not a hero,"" no. But ""All heros are X"" does imply ""Not-X is not a hero."" Noone is bothered by a white protagonist. It's only when all the protagonists are white that we see a problem.

A compelling story will draw people in, regardless of who is in the story. But that is not all that matters. Literature has concerns other than readership; it relates to society, is impacted and has an impact on society. Even when they only seek to play the role of entertainer, authors do more than just tell stories, and it belittles literature to reduce it to its ability to draw people in.

And if art cuts across sex and race constantly, why don't we see it going the other way more often? Stories about white Europeans are enjoyed by everyone, but how many white Europeans have you met with an actual awareness of Chinese literature? This isn't to accuse anyone of conscious racism; at least in America, we've mostly moved away from the sort of obvious discrimination that individuals can be blamed for. But there is a dominant cultural group in our society, and it is much easier for art to cut from the dominant group out than to cut from other groups in."

"> Math is not science.

Look, these are the type of comments that makes it very difficult talk to people like you. Math is a form of science and again it'll just be annoying if you go into details why you don't believe so, but I'll just go with linking a wikipedia article about science.

> In the field of mathematics, rigor is accomplished with proofs.

What makes it difficult with biology is that it's difficult to make proofs while in maths you start with propositional calculus for instance. We do not know the fundamental system of the human body or why it works for sure (we know how it works, but not why). It's like doing a puzzle with only a few pieces.

> If you truly are a professional scientist, I urge you to not be so cavalier stating that the current peer consensus is a ""fact,"" especially when someone legitimately brings up recent experimentation that questions it, and citations are provided.

The problem here is that your article didn't question it one bit. No serious article has questioned it. Putting it simply, your article stated that stemcells could become eggs in a controlled enviroment from mice, which really has very little with wether the amount of eggs a girl has persists during her lifetime.

> The next step in the scientific method is not to blindly claim that experimental data is wrong because it is contrary to what you've been taught, but to do independent experimentation with the intent to disprove the findings of the previous experiment.

I didn't, I knew what he was refering to but assured him that it's widely known and accepted as a fact. Otherwise I'd have to write very detailed comments when I can just make it incredibly short and comprehensionable.

> If you truly are a professional scientist

I just want to clear that I am not a professional scientist, but I've read extensively about biology/chemistry in school (college and higher equivalent).

> The certainty of knowledge, and the entire field of epistemology, is a deep and complicated subject. I did not link the Wikipedia article on the subject just to be a dick. Most of what we all consider ""facts"" are just popular opinion, and attempts to challenge these opinions should not be met with blind, stubborn, uncited or untested rejection. 

I understand that there are no such thing as a true fact, because things change. New knowledge and experiments surface, evolutionary changes etc. It may be close to a fact that we have a head today but not in a million years. But what I am saying is that I can't teach the controversy for every comment. If someone says that I can't calculate the root of -4 I just take the context into account and say that yes with imaginary scale you can, but not otherwise. I'm not going to preach about what the imaginary scale is or how it's mostly invented to solve complex numbers.

> Darwin, Einstein, and many others of our best scientists were outright shouted down in their respective days when they made the claims that ultimately changed how we view the world. That is my sole point. I hope I've made it, especially if you truly are a scientific professional.

I get it, you believe ultimate answers give the wrong impression on how the universe is built and I agree, but this is not the place or time to teach that, and it certainly is not the place to be rude against others for no reason.

So I'm sorry but if there isn't a controversy regarding the information I'm not going to mention the controversy and just mention how we currently know it works. I am incredibly objective and never actually exclude a statement just because ""it is how it is now"" but a random comment on the internet is not actually disproving anything, and is just asking a simple question which currently has a simple answer."
" Thanks for the crash course in what heat is, but I still beg to differ, it has everything to do with methane being liquid, and here's why:
 
 All the reactions that you consider to slow down at 92K are reactions that you are used to seeing at 270K~300K. But I think you would be foolish if you were to assert that at 90K, there exists no chemical reaction which would be fast.

 Heck, there are reactions which are slow at room temperature. But life, has found ways to make use of the most appropriate ones and relegate ones that are too slow off to obsolescence.

 In essence, just as we can not survive in 60 Celsius temperature, there might be an entire biosphere that has methane as their form of liquid (their form of aqueous solution), and has a metabolism that is entirely based on reactions that are ""fast"" at those temperatures, and who, if raised to 270K would die of overheating.

 The other thing is that what you consider to be room temperature, aka ""normal"" temperature is only significant because it is between water's boiling and freezing points. Water: the liquid compound that is used as a medium to all life we know. Otherwise, 270K is just as arbitrary a number as 90K or 500K.

 Everything is relative. The only real limit would be when the temperatures are so high that chemical bonds and reactions are no longer possible."

There is a big difference between the ones who think they are absolutely the smartest one in every room and constantly struggle to prove how smart/nerdy they are versus the ones who are just interested in what they're interested in and view engineer as their job and not some reason why they are better than other people.

Those are not substantive, or point-relevant. Those are personally directed insinuations that discredit, not address a point.

That's... actually black and white thinking.

You do not represent every Men's Rights activist ever. You can claim you speak for them, you can advocate an idea that is one of the proposed core ideas of the ideology. Sure.

But you will never ever be every Men's Rights activist ever. And there will be MRA's with different viewpoints and positions than you. Social movements are inherently somewhat nebulous.

And trying to make it personal instead of substantive widens the gap and muddies the waters.

You wanna judge Feminism on it's outcomes. But Feminism is not a political organization. It is a social movement. It is decentralized and people can claim to align themselves with it by word alone. You could make the argument it's a sentiment more than it's a political organization. 

And any movement that ever came to achieve anything, never was a gestalt hive mind.

>Society is also an umbrella that people with different positions and priorities fall under, but that doesn’t stop feminists analysing the whole thing as a social system of Patriarchy based on its overall outcomes as feminists see it. Likewise, although feminism is not a monolith, I can still analyse feminism as a social system based on its overall outcomes. And the overall outcome that I see coming from feminism is fighting female disadvantage while reinforcing male advantage.

Your use of ""Feminism""? That's actually black and white thinking. I would be astounded if you agreed with me here, or didn't immediately get defensive, so I'm fine with preemptively agreeing to disagree.

And either way, that is a tangent away from the content of our conversation. I am not interested in attempting to discredit any of your points with a strawman, but you should probably be aware for your own benefit, that is actually very black and white thinking.

Think about it?

>If you said that it is all part of the traditional gender system you would be closer to the mark, but that still fails to recognize that feminism has reinforced traditional male disadvantages and in some cases created new ones. For example, traditionally the father had child custody privilege and the responsibility of providing for the children. Beginning in the 19th century, feminists shifted custody privilege to the mother (but kept in place the father’s responsibility to provide child support). Now feminists blame female custody privilege on the traditional system, when in reality it was put in place by feminists.

>So blaming everything on “patriarchy” denies the agency of women in shaping the traditional gender system, and denies the agency of feminists in reshaping the traditional system into today’s feminist gender system. I see you’re trying to avoid doing that in your post, but the very word “patriarchy” carries that connotation.

Can you really take your own statement seriously here?

In the 19th Century?

In the 1800s?

In the United States, women did not yet have the right to work or vote.

The legal status of women was not equal to men and society was radically different. 

In your other reply to my other post, you talked about Feminists interpreting anomalous data however they liked.

The thing of it is, the primary issues of Feminism, social issues about the way people regard women, are not something that happens in the abstract.

It is something that most women have very direct experience with.

Women don't have some notion of rape culture. Some notion of being dismissed by men (Patriarchy). They live it. 

For what you say is Feminism's dominance, women are still living that now. Even Feminist politicians are publicly dismissed by anti-feminist politicians on the basis of their gender.

At first you remained on point, but now you're diving into gish-galloping and sensationalism and misrepresentation. 

I was acknowledging that there were Men's issues, and instead of having a dialogue were you also try to see my point of view, you point me to r/rbomi and start discrediting women's issues and making huge sweeping generalizations about an entire gender.

You went from initially acknowledging Feminism to attacking it. Not offering a substantive critique of it, just lobbing nebulous emotional accusations at it.

But ""Feminism"" is still here and isn't going anywhere because we're still having this conversation.

Because you're still not considering the realities of the people proposing ""Feminism"".

Men's issues are very serious and need to be addressed.

But you are not doing that.

You are not helping Men's issues. You are not advocating for Men's issues.

You're just attacking Feminism to feel good about yourself, in a way that does not make a difference to men.

Maybe take a look at r/MensLib or something if you want to see what people organizing to transcend men's social issues looks like. 

Do you. But when people get frustrated with you or dismiss you, just know it isn't because they ""couldn't handle the truth"", or whatever you're probably going to tell yourself."
">It absolutely is a conversion. That's what we call it when you move from one religion to another.

Except that conversion requires personal commitment and change. The way we look at it, the ordinance is performed whether or not the person decides to accept it. We don't look at it as ""making people Mormon"" because that would take away their agency. 

Like, what if I went swimming with you and pushed you into the pool. If I said the right words and told you that you were baptized now, would you be a Mormon? No. 

I'm sorry you don't agree with this practice. But frankly, I'm not sure why you care. If you believe that religion is man-made, then there certainly is no heaven or hell, and you certainly shouldn't care whether or not someone does your baptism by proxy. After all, if there is no heaven or hell, then there certainly is no life after this one, and you certainly won't care if your work has been done or not. 

But if there is a heaven and a hell, and lets just say for the sake of the argument that baptism is necessary, and continuing this vain let's just say that the LDS faith holds the necessary authority to baptize in Jesus' name. You might appreciate us then. 

But if not, we believe that you will be able to accept or reject this ordinance. It's there for you if you want it, but if not: that's your choice. "

The other group, she then said, are the exact group that we're talking about, that Obama talked about. People might want to work with her because the American people voted her to be president. She's shown empathy and wants to find solutions to the problems of the rural white working class. 

A part of the problem here is that both sides need to compromise something in their beliefs. It needs to be brought up that there is a lot of racism in the United States, and it's a problem that needs to be addressed. And, honestly, there have to be people who perpetuate these ideas, or else they wouldn't be so frequently seen. And maybe the democrats haven't struck enough of a fine line between ""If you hold racist attitudes, your non-racist problems still deserve attention"" and ""outright neo-nazis and terrorist groups like the KKK are completely unacceptable."" 


But, just to point something out, there have been many racist congressmen who've spoken to Americans in much worse ways, and religious communities, and other immigrant groups - from the Irish to Latinos. 

Plus, why do Obama's words have to be taken in the worst way possible? I'm not saying this as a ""gotcha."" I understand the concept of dogwhistles, but why are his words interpreted as ""they're dumb"" and not ""they're decent people who have harmful beliefs due to anger in other places in their lives.""?

">but acting on them is.

I believe that gay relationships are not a sin, if it is monogamous and within the bounds of marriage.

Affirming denominations are not thinking “Gay stuff is a sin, but we really need butts in seats, so let’s tell them it’s ok so they come to church, even though we secretly know they will go to hell.”

We truly believe that God fully affirms LGBT people. We put a Pride flag in front of our church because queer folk have been hurt and bullied by Christians for years, yet so many of them still hunger for the gospel. That flag signifies that we are a space that values them as they are, and that their queerness is not sinful.

We still believe that sin is real and serious, and if anyone comes to our parish with sin, queer or straight, we will address that. We are all in need of Christ’s grace.

I honestly don’t have the mental energy to explain the theological reasons behind all that. But I’ll direct you to Matthew Vines , who really helped me reach this point.

Allies are welcomed to attend. However, if you are cisgender and heterosexual and wish to speak at this event, we ask that you reflect and examine if your particular voice is needed at this time and at this space, considering the voice of cisgender and heterosexual people is heard everywhere constantly, even during times of mourning for LGBT+ people.

Has there been any evidence that the African American community was affect more than the any other race during this tragedy? I haven't seen any. So than why is this event only catered towards LBGT+, Latin, and people of color. ""Allies"" or white people aren't as welcomed as everyone else it seems. Because? Was there no white people killed at Pulse the other night? I haven't seen any evidence that a specific race was targeted. 

>We will not be using the hashtag #LGBTLivesMatter nor will be using #LatinxLivesMatter . This is because both of these hashtags take from the movement #BlackLivesMatter.

Doing a search on Google I can't find any information as to what Vietnam content is in the actual patch.

This begs the question, are we really sure there is Vietnam content in that patch? Or, is the ""preparation"" they speak of just that splash screen teasing Vietnam.

So again, I understand applying this morality to a government and a society. If you wish to apply it to an individual, then please justify doing so.

All of the arguments against lying and stealing that you and others have put forth so far revolve around, ""What if you get caught?"" It's similar to arguing that I shouldn't get out of bed because I could trip and die. I judge that the benefits outweigh the risks, so I do it.

You don't know my life, and you state that this morality is based on the practical. To say that any action's practicality is objective is absurd and needs to be proven before it can be asserted.

"slightly left leaning independent disclaimer

This is one thing that conservatives have as a legitimate concern IMO. I am in an industry where I have the opportunity to many different companies and see a lot of different industries on a very intimate level. We do contract work for these companies.

 Not always, but VERY often we bring in new employees that outperform union workers that make twice as much and we do it with about 30% less employees.

I have seen some crazy things....union members sleeping, drinking, stealing, etc and often not even making much effort to hide it because their supervisors won't bother to discipline them because it would get overturned anyway.

The most experienced people get to bid into jobs before less experienced people. So what happens is you have your most experienced people pushing a broom around making $32/hr.

Then it gets worse. If you need additional personnel for manufacturing, you have to offer overtime in order of seniority. So if you want to bring in an assembly line worker on a Saturday, you have to bring in 5 broom pushers, maintenance men, etc just to get to the 1 guy you need. And of course those 5 guys don't have anything to do, so they just sleep or hide somewhere playing cards. And all of this is just accepted. BTW, if you ask them to do something else, they will file a grievance because it's not in their job description (that they bid into).


I am a corporate trainer. I am what many consider ""new age manager"". I teach managers to behave ethically, to utilize two way communication to truly engage employees, etc. So I am all for fairness in the workplace and worker rights.

But with that said...more often than not, unions are bad for everyone involved. They are bad for the business, they are bad for the employee, and they are bad for quality. Union workers are usually so focused on the company being their adversary that they have a hatred for the organization. As a result, they don't truly engage or develop as they should and it hurts their career.

Typically when a union factory goes out of business, most of the employees struggle to find work they are qulified for in the real world. And when they find something, either they are paid much less, or they have to work much harder. It's like spoiling your children. You aren't doing them any favors. Someday they will enter the real world and be overwhelmed.


On most social issues, I side with the left. But their association with unions is one place where I deviate. I understand WHY they support unions. They get huge contributions from them. But it's bad for their image among business people."

 Mods were censoring any criticism of their douchebaggery on their own subreddit.

If that's happening now it's mostly a reaction to getting brigaded, and to make sure the shitstorm from a week ago doesn't repeat itself. ""it's just a joke/meme"" doesn't excuse people from having harassed someone.

That's assuming he was doing much (or any) of that prior to this incident. It may be hard to believe but our mods barely had to do anything.

I wish that people who don't want to be invaded can have an easier option of opting out, so that everyone can play the way they want.

But that's not the way the game is made, and I'm fine with it. I just wish, that's all.

What I'm proposing is a way for everyone to get what they want. What you're defending is your right to play the way you want against people who aren't prepared for it in the name of ""balance"".

I'll also add this: The architects who designed this building have done a very good job of listening to (reasonable) concerns about the design of the building. Respect. I live on the Bernal side of it, and they did some very thoughtful work to make the Bernal-facing side much less... ugly. I appreocated how much they listened, and the work they did to improve the design. So while I will lose some of my skyline view... it's fine.

"There are many ways to be Buddhist. The Mahayana schools are all about the use of skillful means to bring as many beings as possible to awakening. Recitation of the names of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas can be a more accessible means of practice for people who were/are not inclined to more ""silent"" traditions, or who don't have the means. 


Also, nearly every Buddhist tradition takes for granted the concept of merit transference, even Theravada and Zen, and the most supreme merit in Pureland thought is the light of compassion from Amitabha Buddha's compassionate vows to guide beings to enlightenment who might otherwise would not get a chance to do so, at least not until several lifetimes later. Availing ourselves to our teacher's, Shakyamuni Buddha, call and trusting in Amitabha's vows is analogous to non-calculating thought in any other contemplative practice, with just a different focus.


You will find that there are different schools of Buddhism with almost contrasting methods, and Buddhism isn't a ""one way"" religion, so that's okay. But I will also point out that this contrast between Zen/Theravada and Pureland practice is often exaggerated. Like I mentioned in another post, Ch'an and Thien, the Chinese and Vietnamese equivalents to Zen, respectively, combine sitting practice with Amitabha recitation. 


As far as Theravada, one only needs to go to a wat full of families who have been Buddhist for generations to see that the modern, western idea of Theravadin Buddhism as ""pristine"" (there's no such thing) just doesn't hold up to reality. 


Even still, it is a teaching of Mahayana Buddhism that all beings come to practice or not due to the fruit of their karma, so people not inclined to silent practice have many other dharma doors to choose from, of which Pureland practice is one. It's not just ""Christianity for Buddhists"", but honestly this isn't something that concerns me; Christians who fit into their beliefs have a karmic connection to their religion and I to mine, and that's really it.

"1) Science can certainly tell us things about causality. In fact, I would say that the theistic notion of causality itself comes from a scientific claim, namely the notion that the reason for movement is that one thing bumps into another thing, which causes it to move. This is a Aristotelian idea, and it has been debunked by science. The modern scientific notion of causality is that things move continuously without a cause, until they are interrupted by something in their way. I there is nothing in the way of there objects, they go about their mary way without ever stopping. This new notion of movement basicly eliminates the necessity of a causal chain, as movement is appears to be more like a continuation then a chain of cause and effect. This is an example of science re-examining the notion of causality.
 
I would love you to provide me with links, why didn't you do this in the first place?

2) I agree with the notion that a positive assertion warrants a response that attempts to disprove it (or agrees with it), I disagree, however, that this makes a positive claim. It merely debunks a positive claim made, and whatever positive claims replace it, have nothing to do with the definition of atheism.

3) You have Buddhist, Taoist, and ancient Greek traditions which do not but a God figure at the basis of ethics, but do not hold to natural claims. As the OP pointed out, there exist super naturalists that are nevertheless atheists. Placing the source of ethical claims outside of nature does not make one a theist. 

about the religion definition, I withdrawal my statement about that your definition gives everyone a metaphysical claim. You gave good counter examples. Obviously I disagree with the notion that atheists have metaphysical claims, as that precisely is what I am arguing against here."

No, VELOSTODON risked goodwill with the Trump camp. He was constantly overstepping boundaries, claiming credit for every little thing, and trying to dominate discussions.

"You know, when you go to reddit and read all these posts, and always see guys saying 'I don't care about gender, why do girls always say something? No one really cares!' or similar lines. It's complete bullshit. The internet doesn't care who you are as long as you pretend you're a man. You may not believe me but for every guy that I've met playing games that doesn't care about your gender, there are another 9 who make it out to be something.

I'm not saying EVERY GUY EVER does this, but it's a complete lie to say 'the majority does not act like this.' 

I don't even care about the mis-gendering but I care about the instant dismissive attitude of your ability, the white knightery, and yes, the droves of awkward internet dudes hitting on you. I'm tired of reading on reddit, 'girls make such a big deal, it's not a big deal' because maybe yes, you don't do this but your personal attitude isn't reflective of the majority sadly. It's like saying 'I live in this major city and I barely ever see homophobia anywhere anymore, no one cares why do people still make a big deal of it,' while there's hundreds of thousands of people in other areas holding up signs about how gays deserve to die and burn. 'But those people are stupid,' people argue. Well, sorry, can anyone really argue that there aren't hundreds of thousands of 'stupid' gamers? 

I never made it a big deal. Guys always did for the last 15 years I've been playing games. I hesitate to use voice chat. I pretend to be a guy usually. If I play competitively or in a group and my gender is known, I feel pressured to play perfectly because a single mistake and suddenly it's always 'lul girl' or 'oh here, let me patronizingly explain to you how to do everything.' And if 'no one cares about your gender' why is it always the advice of guys here to girls complaining about harassment of 'don't tell them, you deserve it if you let them know?'

This says nothing to the credit of Islam itself because that distinction is entirely arbitrary from the point of view of scripture.

> which is the stupidest argument ever. thats like saying owning a VW makes you 10x more likely to die in a car accident involving a VW. using gun crime, gun death, or what have you is a misnomer used to push anti-gun propoganda. if you want to look at how a gun affects your life you need to view your total crime, death etc.

Okay, maybe you didn't get exactly what I was claiming here. Let me try to clarify my claim: owning a gun presents some risk of death which is higher than a non-gun owner's. The chance that you will ever need a gun in a self-defence situation is extremely low. The chances that you will be involved in a gun-related accident are higher than the chances of ever needing a gun in self-defence. Therefore, owning a gun for self defence actually increases your overall chance of harm, even if it slightly reduces it in extremely rare cases (which is disputed, but beyond the scope of my claims.)

Therefore, my argument is that since the risks of gun ownership are higher than the chances of needing a gun in self-defence, choosing to purchase a gun for home defence is a step backward in personal security. Regardless, you have a right to purchase a firearm, so you can subject yourself to that increased risk if you want to. But it's irresponsible to subject a child to it, since they have no choice in the matter and have not yet developed the ability to properly make that choice.

The same is true for cars, however cars are necessary for transportation in modern society, and we've taken as many steps as we can. Guns are not, and are not adequately licenced and regulated in the United States.

The rest of your argument is irrelevant until you can properly address my actual claims (and not the words you've put into my mouth) with scientific evidence.

I honestly think most of it is not stupidity but laziness and indifference. Most people would rather drink a beer and watch non-news tv after a hard day at work than inform themselves to make better decisions.

The trick is that Bill Maher is editorial/news entertainment just like Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and Bill O'Reilly. He's just another voice in the political theater. He needs to be loud and say controversial things because that is what people listen to these days, as you pointed out. If he sat there and made quiet, well-reasoned arguments the people who just want to drink beer and watch tv wouldn't notice. In fact, I doubt they notice anyway. They hear something that sounds catchy, believe it, and spew it back in the polls.

I think it's good to have these counterpoints to the blowhards on the other side of the fence, but it would be better to have none of them. It would be better if people started taking personal responsibility for learning about their representatives, the issues, and formulate opinions based on their research.

The only way I know to really effect change is by educating, educating, and educating some more. Somehow convince people that this is important, they can make a difference, and it starts with their children, peers, and neighbors. Indifference is a tough nut to crack, and it often takes a pretty strong shock to get people moving. I guess if our economy degrades further, maybe they will wake up and start informing themselves.

Regardless...Bill Maher's point is definitely valid. He is not saying they vote republican because they are stupid. He is saying that voting Republican at this point is stupid if you are Working or Lower Middle Class. It is hard, logically, to argue this point. I don't really know how you would. Though I would point out that voting Democrat is only slightly better. When it comes down to it, neither side is really representing that group of people."

"(continued)

>Movements (feminism)

Yes, feminism favours and promotes women - as equal to men, as persons in their own right, and its traditional focus has been in examining gender disparities while trying to erode them through legal measures and social change. You're right that feminism doesn't focus as heavily on men, and I think this, in large part, has been about the lack of male feminists, and also the optics of men taking over a segment of feminism to work primarily for men instead of advancing feminism. Menslib is something I don't know enough about to describe well, but it seems to self-reflexively examine masculinity and how to improve things for men without doubling-down on gender expectations.

And for feminists, ""but what about the men?"" is literally a trope people roll their eyes at, but I feel quite morally uneasy about the lack of options for young men who don't fit into the traditional, dominant, masculine mold in our society. The easiest emotion to feel over this, as a guy, is not thoughtful introspection, but rage, and lashing out at rejection. And so I understand the predicament: to join a movement centered around woman probably feels like a cop-out, accepting one's state as a beta male or whatever. To tell a women's movement that they should do more for men, while not doing things for oneself, is obviously not going to go over easily. And the problems are nebulous, and the solutions are not even things guys want to hear: basically knock down the imprisoning parts of gender expectations, so if you are not 100% a macho male, you don't have to be, and you can find acceptance and love for who you are. 

But that source of love might also not be 100% a traditional feminine, pretty woman, either. And would you be all right with that?

27 Percent of California Teens Are Gender Nonconforming


That's probably as good as it gets. And I think that stat is probably bending the details a lot.

> Ultimately, the study’s authors found that 27 percent, or 796,000, of California’s youth, are GNC. Of the two sub-groups, 21 percent were classified as androgynous, and 6 percent as highly GNC.

That makes sense. Actual 6% were highly gnc. That is cross conforming.

When GC complains highly cross conforming males are ""just conforming to another stereotype."" I kind of agree. In that sense I don't think people are escaping gender by conforming to the opposite gender norms.

Your turn to find a citation that backs up your side. Something saying that everyone is only conforming because that is how they were socialized?

> You're not even trying to read. I already addressed this exact turn of phrase you're using. You are not ""having an opinion"". You are outright saying ""Women don't want _"" ""women like "" ""women think _ is unnatural"".

Well yes, I am having an opinion on how I think population of men and women are.

I'm not saying everyone is conforming. I'm saying a minority are not conforming.

You seem to think me describing how I see things is compulsion on things ought to be.

> And I'm telling you I don't give a fuck what you think. You're a male. Your thoughts on the female experience means diddly squat.

lol. Well I care what you think. And I think you what I think. Don't we care what lots of people think?

>> And I don't think the majority of woman feel the same way as GC feminists feel about gender, trans politics aside.

> ""Please do strive to pay more attention to what women think and feel and less about how you personally think we think and feel.

> Stop being so obtuse.

I guess we just disagree on that.

I don't think the ""gender abolition"" is a popular idea among the majority of women.

> I do not care what you think women think, feel, want, or value. From here on out I am ignoring each and every one of your statements regarding your personal interpretations of the lives and mentalities of women, as you seem completely incapable of commenting on those experiences without framing them through your own ego. As you obviously do not care to listen to the voices of women, I'm not going to listen to you. Change your behavior and I'll retract this.

OK. What is it you want me to say?

This sounds like ""agree with me or I'll ignore you."" What kind of debate would that be?

> Because they do not understand what it is. Ask any random woman what ""radical feminism"" means, see if they'll be able to tell you accurately.

Doesn't mean they'll believe it. Liberal feminism is more popular than radical feminism. Just by practice. Liberal feminists know what radical feminism and they don't choose it. The split was real.

> Jesus Christ. Or maybe they're just acting in natural human ways, but in accordance with our socially constructed notions of gender, we've simply labelled -insert behaviors- as ""female gender expression"" and -insert other behaviors- as ""male gender expression"". How can you be this daft.

Because how can a person have a natural interest in feminine things?

GC is arguing that it's personality. I'm arguing that doesn't explain things.

The categories of masculine and feminine are a mix of biological things and utterly constructed things.

But if a personality is naturally attracted to expressing ""masculinity"" there has to be some natural relationship between the category of masculine and that personality.

I'm trying to understand that relationship. To that end I suggest humans natural gender demarcate things. That includes gender expression and behaviours.

That would explain the patterns of categorization and social construction.

>> gc women do not have average attitudes to gender, gay or straight.

> Is this sarcasm or are you contradicting yourself.

How so? I think most of gc would admit they do not have average attitudes.

> Oh now there are romantic gender roles. But if it's mainstream doesn't that prove my point. Women like a kind of man that is quite different than what society teaches men to be.

????

The ""romantic male"" from romantic and erotic fiction that are popular with women are very gender conforming. They are some of the most cliched and stereotypical forms of masculinity around.

That is standard feminist understanding that is agreed by nearly of types of feminism.

That some women enjoy erotic literature that breaks the norms isn't disputed by anyone. But they are in the minority.

Do you really need a citation on what men are like romantic/erotic literature?

> You have a mountain of convenient claims which seem solely based on your own thoughts and experiences and nothing else. So you subvert gender norms, and you have atypical romantic interests, and that's fine and dandy, but no one else is like that.

Nope I say the majority are conforming. And that seems natural.

> Everyone else is hard wired to conform to gender norms.

No there are minority who seem wired to cross conform to varying degrees.

> Gender is innate and natural and everybody loves gender norms except you and your entire circle of GNC people and relationships.

lol. Well it's not quite as simple as that.

What are gender norms is contested and varies.

> People have been rejecting it as a society step by step for centuries.

Ah a gradual change?

Does that mean some societies are closer to rejecting gender more than others?

Which ones?

> Socialization is not all or nothing. You can object to it and try to reject it, but that doesn't mean it won't work at all. I was one of those kids. Tomboy my entire life, GNC, hung out with boys more than girls, etc, etc. I was still socialized female and I carry that with me everywhere.

OK. So why do you think you rejected socialization?

Honestly I've heard it more from 99.99% more from TV, movies, schoolyard 'norms' that ""gays are weird"". Luckily I have half a brain and can determine that it make no difference whether or not someone is homosexual... but religion has very little to do with that. 

For how ""enlightened"" some people claim to be, they seem to not understand that some politicians fight gay marriage because it will gain them votes, due to irrational prejudices, as opposed to actually leading their districts, counties, states.

So if you kill a person while he is sleeping, it doesn't constitute a crime because there was no pain felt? What does the perception of oneself have to do with being a human? An infant doesn't have a perception of oneself. What does the ability of feeling pain have to do with being human? Are anesthetized people not human? Are people without the ability to feel pain not human?

You don't. None of us do. It's another manipulation trick by guys who make us feel guilty that like we owe them an explanation as to why we don't want their dick. Even if I was straight ""not interested"" should be enough without having to hear ""but why?"". A real man would move on when hearing 'NO' for the first time. Sadly media encourages men to keep up these toxic behaviors.

My sexuality is a private thing. I'm proud to be gay, but as I've said on the sub before I'm probably 99% lesbian. Should I be required to explain to every guy that yes maybe a couple times a year I am attracted to a (feminine) guy? Fuck no. My sexual attractions and my partner are MY business, and I don't owe them shit. Anymore I just say ""I have someone"" (which I do) and if they want to assume that someone is male great because they'll leave me alone. If I told them my partner was female they'd just ask for threesomes or if she's hot.

Also just want to say we shouldn't lose prospective here. I see this sub fight a lot over this issue of labels... and myself and other women have sometimes been pretty strict about defining yourself as bi or lesbian because of men's behavior. Yet we shouldn't fight with each other but perhaps talk more about how to deal with these toxic men. As I said before even if we were 100% straight just saying 'no thanks' should be enough. If it's not these men need to learn respect . No one should feel obligated to enter a debate with someone they barely know on whether or not that dude deserves sex or a chance at sex with you."

"Bucklar already clarified the matter regarding the source on the Nth Degree, but more generally, I'd like to clarify several things:

This entire post was intended to encourage discussion of Star Trek and literary/film references. It was not intended as a ""let's prove beyond a doubt which episodes were definitively inspired by which prior works of fiction by finding quotes from production sources."" Yes, some of my assertions are based on circumstantial evidence. But this entire sub is constantly filled with fan theories and assertions that attempt to explain obvious inconsistencies in Trek canon (due to the fact that it's a work of fiction created by many, many people spanning decades) with in-universe explanations that are certainly creative but often strain credulity or reasonableness and are based on the flimsiest pieces of evidence. We do this because it's fun. But for some reason, you seem incredibly intent on naysaying the entire exercise I was trying to get going here, while several others have clearly gotten the idea and been able to add to the discussion. 

Regarding Rascals & Home Alone. Do I have anything beyond circumstantial proof? No. Does the episode and the timing of its production strongly suggest a connection to Home Alone? Absolutely. I say this as someone who worked in TV and feature film development for several years. Professional writers become professionals because they are good writers who love and are incredibly well-versed in their chosen medium and genre. (That's why I'm confident that ""Flowers for Algernon"" was in the back of Joe Menosky's mind when he wrote ""Nth Degree"", with or without a quote backing me up.) 

With Rascals, consider how disjointed the story actually is. The episode starts off with a transporter accident, then spends time with the various characters contemplating their situation--it's played totally straight. Then, halfway through the story, out of nowhere a handful of Ferengi suddenly take over the ship. Both the tone and plot do a complete left turn, and the episode becomes a farce where the kids retake the ship, and then at the very end the transporter accident is quickly and easily reversed. It's an utterly preposterous episode made up of two disjointed halves. 

Now, combined with the timing of its production, that to me strongly suggests that the story was developed in one of two ways:

1) Somebody had an idea for the crew to turn into kids (a potentially interesting sci-fi premise)--how would that affect the characters? What if they couldn't change back, etc.? But then they couldn't figure out where the story should go from there, and Home Alone--a ubiquitous pop culture reference of the prior year--was suggested as a fun, lightweight way to wrap up the episode. 

2) Somebody suggested ""Let's do a Home Alone episode""--maybe the original idea was Alexander-centric--and the front half was tacked-on to have child characters we would actually care about. 

Either way, the conspicuously disjointed quality of the episode strongly suggests a modular approach to the writing process--and I'm willing to bet that one of those modules was Home Alone.

More broadly, while there are tropes that have existed for millennia, and there are ideas out in the ether, the timing of events is revealing here. DS9 did an episode where Bashir and O'Brien go into Sloan's mind to extract information--a classic sci-fi trope that was also used by Inception a decade or so later. Clearly, in this case, DS9 could not have been inspired by Inception. But, for sake of argument, if Inception had come out the year before and been #1 at the box office for 3 months, and then DS9 just happened to do that episode... I'd be strongly inclined to believe that the writers were at the very least aware of the connection and would have been influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the film."
"This is a very valid concern. I've learned the hard way that the person you think would never treat you the way you see them treat others - absolutely will...someday. If they are capable of such things, you will absolutely find yourself at the other end of that kind of treatment at some point down the line when you invariably fall on the other side of their 'good graces'. Whether that means they are mad at you, bored with you and ready to move on or you've just fallen into the 'take you for granted' territory. 

You learn a LOT by watching how people treat others in their life - whether it's their parents, siblings, kids, friends, employees, service staff and random strangers - especially when they are angry or upset. But even just how they treat people on a regular ongoing basis. If you find they treat certain people in ways you find disturbing, mean, uncaring, or just in a way you would never want to be treated yourself - that's a red flag. Unless that person has done something to them to warrant that treatment - you should pay attention. Because if you know they are capable of treating people that way, but think you are different and special and they wouldn't ever treat you that way - think again.

BF may be a very caring, wonderful person to OP now and to other casual friends and acquaintances and even strangers. But what happens when he find himself feeling similar feelings towards OP that he currently does towards his mom?

Someone who actually seems to have taken good care of him growing up, someone who still shows love for him and forgiveness for his cold, uncaring behavior - someone who deserves that why? ""just because""? 

Unless there really was some serious actual wrong doing or abuse or something to warrant the cold, uncaring behavior towards his mom - it would seriously concern me that someone supposedly so 'wonderful, kind and caring' could treat someone so harshly 'just because'. There's something really wrong with that. And I can't say it enough - OP is mistaken if she thinks he's incapable of turning that same cold, harsh treatment towards her one day 'just because'.

> Being a good process framework, Scrum has one fatal disadvantage: stand-ups only happen ever 24h, which feels like an eternity. You should ask your team for status updates at least every few hours during the day, better in person. This way you can make sure they aren’t slacking and are always stressed enough to deliver until your next check.

Yea, that too. The ""product manager"" (another guy) would do this thing several times a day, where he come over behind my desk, places his hand firmly on my shoulder, and ask ""how is it going?"".

But perhaps I don't travel in the right circles.

>Meaning that the women who play extremely hard to get with asian men opens up easily to white men. Try making an observation. You'd see that asian women are more open to being intimate with their white partners but more conservative with their asian partners. 

In your experience why do Asian women play extremely hard to get with Asian men, but not with white men? 

>It IS true that white men are willing to take the lead but I have seen these asian men being the one to initiate but with cold responses. So this Taiwanese man's frustration (and mine in fact) could come from the fact that he has to put in more effort with less results compared to the British man who (he assumes) can put in less effort but reap better rewards.

Why do Asian women have this double standard?

And, well, I'll save the mistreatment of native Canadians for another time, but there's another bucket of pain and inequality that plagues our country.

However, a free, prosperous, safe society is what people are striving for. Canada is doing an incredible job and making leaps and bounds in terms of creating a safe place for everyone to live, but there's still a lot work to do, and a lot of things that people are still healing from. That, right there, at the very least is what people want recognition for - and to not glaze over the problem and pretend everything is fine, when it IS fine for some (coincidentally, generally white folk) but not all.

Finally, I just want to ask : why do you resist the idea that things can be better? Why do you resist the thought that through discussion, honesty, and openness about the challenges people face, that people's attitudes might shift into something that's more peaceful?

It is. It is one story. You just want to say its pointless because you are making this extreme argument that failures make things pointless.

> he would've refused Luke's request to be trained and also given a whole ""It's time for the Jedi to end"" speech. 


Yoda did refuse him. Yoda messed with him. Gave up on him, gave him another chance. Yoda and Luke are two different people, why would Yoda come to the same conclusion Luke did?

"> I don't see why this means Luke didn't understand how to run the Jedi Order. If Luke understands the Jedi philosophy, why can't he teach it? Isn't that what being a Master means? Can you come up with any examples in the PT where being a Jedi Master meant running the Order in a way a Jedi Knight wouldn't or couldn't? 

The Jedi and the ""Church"" are not the same thing. Luke was taught to be an individual not how to run an organization so he fell back and used the established rules of that organization. 

Obi-Wan saying a Lightsaber is a Jedi's life for example. That seems pretty un-Jedi like. Forcing kids into a philosophy they cannot possibly comprehend. Getting involved politically in general seems pretty un-Jedi. This is what led to their fall. These are also not things that Luke was taught. 

> Not the Catholic church, but you would be able to lead a Church. 


But that's not what is happening. Leading the Church is not the same as recreating the Church. Sure Luke probably would have been great if the Jedi Counsel was still around. He likely would have been a breathe of fresh air. But that's not the situation he was in. He was trying to resurrect a dead religion using almost entirely second hand information and tall tales. 


> And if anyone would've realized this about Anakin, it is Luke. Luke using Anakin's emotions means Luke is also not an emotionless monster. Right there he is already philosophically incompatible with the ways of the Old Jedi Order, so I just disagree that he would seek to recreate the Old Jedi Order in its entirety. 

Why would he? He didn't know his father. All he knew was he betrayed the Jedi. You are right that he is philosophically incompatible. But his goal wasn't to improve the Jedi (which it should have been), it was to recreate the Jedi. Being great at something does not mean you'd make a great teacher. Just like being a great cook does not mean you know how to run a restaurant. 


Its not to say that Luke could not have been a great master or leader but he was doing more than he could handle with no one around to show him.

The literal rolling up of the sleeves and exposing of cleavage was Romancing the Stone levels of silly-pretty-woman syndrome. The 'you should have kids, it's worth it' conversation; what was the purpose of that other than to imply that all work and no family is bad for a woman?
I could go on, and yes the T-Rex thing at the end was cool, but there was something very weird, almost uncanny valley-like about her character, and it was something on the ""I'm a pretty, dainty, not-so-smart, no-so-seriously-taken"" side of the valley. It just feels weird for lots of people these days to see Ms. Dainty play with Mr. Rough and Tough for 2 whole hours and take it all seriously. Of course Pratt is just as much a stereotype, except that his role is positively reinforced while hers is implicitly criticised again and again.

as for the block going outside the function-call parens, note that that's syntactically harmonious when you're using a non-sexp-based language. the intention is closer to simulating a control structure than to passing an argument, hence the difference in syntax at use-site. syntax at call site is different because it's doing something different under the hood; if you want to reify the block into a proc and call it using proc.call, you're welcome to."

"I wonder how much cultural similarity is lost in translation. I can't find the video right now but I remember several sketches, fairly old, from Japan that could easily be mistaken for Benny Hill sketches if it wasn't for the different races, scenery, props.

Harem anime such as the old series Love Hina and Ah! My Goddess are of course one guy with one true love and several optional girls... but just how different is this from Cheers or Frazier? Carla (the waitress in Cheers) is always there as an option for Sam as he pursues the Tsundere Diane. 

Frazier also has several females hover around him. Yes they have sex with other men BUT that is because that sitcom has sex in it, the anime do not. The females around frazier are still all there for him, supporting him in the various forms girlfriends can take. Try it, watch the series and try to spot the Tsundere, Deredere and Yandere. 

If you look past the most obvious differences, the real differences are not that big.

A trope for school anime is the culture festival. Surely western sitcoms don't have this... Halloween preparation episode? If you loom beyond the visuals and ask ""why was this event chosen for the plot"" then the need for a character to display say organizing ability, becomes pretty similar no matter what is chosen. 

Yakuza and GTA aren't really all that different. They are not exactly the same but both glorify a criminal element with which the other culture is totally unfamiliar except in real life. And both are parodies and both cultures have people who don't get that, that GTA is not real, it is as over the top as Yakuza. 

That I think is the real issue, that we tend to take the other culture to serious. Balloon sized boobs in Anime? Only a small portion has that, less then the balloon boobs in super hero comics. But because those upset by it see only a fraction of the media put out, they think it is all Big Boobs.

West has a tolerance for violence? Explain all the Tycoon style games,the city builders, Truck/Train/Plane/Farming sims. 

But people in Japan, not that into western gaming, are not exposed to this, they see GTA. 

For every violent western game I can show you a non-violent game and for every sexualized Japanese game I can show you a non-sexual one.

For every high quality BBC comedy I can show you a really bad one and for every really crap US sitcom I can... well not quite for every one of them but there are quite a few good ones.

You just got to look a bit deeper. Going that the west makes violent games and japan sexualized is as shallow as claiming all Indian food is curry, Americans only do fast food and England only does horrible... so I suck at making my point. Sue me!

Your penis doesn't invalidate your experience.

On Twitter and Reddit, it's usually okay, but arguments can break out pretty easily, even over petty stuff. This sub itself, I have mixed feelings on. At first I just saw it as a bunch of mean-spirited old heads and stuck to lurking, though I eventually got over that (though make no mistake, they do exist).

Again though, it's generally ok. People here are very passionate, and quite insightful as well, as well as being pretty helpful to each other. That said, I don't think it's quite as inclusive as people here make it out to be. Perhaps it's leftover spite from having a pretty poor introduction to the sub (as a new Awakening fan coming in during the midst of it, and new fans like me, being the sub's main topic of criticism a couple years ago), but I do feel as if there's a kind of unspoken bias against newer games and characters besides Echoes (ironically the remake of an old game. Also I've played and enjoyed the majority of the series at this point so this isn't just the perspective of a casual fan).

It's also critical as it is passionate, to the point that it can honestly be a bit of a drag, sometimes.

"I'm a white dude and have no right to question why certain minorities vote a certain way...but, I got a few questions:

- The private prison system disproportionately harms the African American community. They represent 13% of the population but 40% of inmates are African Americans. Who's the strongest candidate when it comes to prison reform? Bernie Sanders! Who aggressively lobbied for the 3 strike rules giving life sentences to many African Americans for minor crap? CLINTON! 

- Whether you like it or not, right now African Americans account for a majority of low wage workers. Who wants to change that NOW? Bernie Sanders. Clinton only wants the same level in 2022, when inflation will have eaten most of those gains!

- The financial crisis costing a tooooon of jobs and still depresses salary growth for the low and middle class was caused by reckless deregulation of large financial institutions...deregulation that started under Reagan, was further pushed through by Clinton and ultimately Bush. Which candidate wants to go up against those financial institutions that screwed us all over and which one is in bed with them? Just look at where the lobbying money goes and you'll realize Clinton is a bought sock puppet in that regard while Sanders is VERY consistently against them.

I am not saying Clinton hasn't done anything good for minorities, but right now, Sanders plans are infinitely more beneficial. Why on earth does she still have a lead with minorities???

Sure I agree limited snaps because he was injured makes sense. I don't think he was given near enough especially due to lack of depth this game but like you said I'm not a coach.

BUT Last year does matter. If the Broncos came out and benched Von Miller week one it wouldn't make sense right? Why bench a guy after a good season before he can even play a game? Jerry has played in 6 games this year with 0 starts and has 2 sacks compared to Emanuels 0 in 10 starts. Jerry has 7 tackles compared to Emanuels 15. Emanuel has 1 career sack and it was week 1 his rookie year!

From watching him every week and by looking at the stats Emanuel isn't a good pass rusher while Attouchu on the other hand has 8 times the sacks Emanuel does in significantly less snaps. But you say Emanuel is good at seting the edge well so is THE #1 PLAYER AGAINST THE RUN 

So knowing all this is think we all should come to the conclusion that Attouchu>Emanuel. So if Attouchu has and still is out playing Emanuel but Emanuel is still starting above him (and even Williams is) then I'm starting to think it might not be all about the injury... but hey, I'm not a coach right? What do I know? The coaches that are constantly on the brink of being fired every week are clearly great at their job.

"Every part of your argument is based on perceived 'implications' and assumptions that just are not there, they are perceived only by you and people who think like you. People who don't think like you do Not have that. Not one of your comments has been clear. Here is a good example from the last one:

> I’m sorry, but you don’t know why you make every assumption not every assumption you make. 

Put aside the strawman that I was not arguing that point, and see that this sentence doesn't make sense, on its face... and it isn't the only one in that comment. There are a number of those types of things in nearly every comment you make.

I am not sure if you are aware of how poorly you word things (or perhaps type things)... a simpler and less annoying but still difficult thing here is when you refer to America as if it has one mode. Most Americans do not view homosexuality as bad or funny. Every study I have seen agrees with this. Does this mean that no Americans feel that way? No. But referring to our country as some singular entity like, ""America laughs at X or doesnt"" is just going to bring the conversation to a halt.

But that said, I don't want to end the convo either, I just can't argue points that I didn't make. You said,:

>You’re getting hung up on this tangent in a pretty accusatory way. I’m trying to communicate properly.

The reason I am hung up on it is because assuming things that I didn't say derails communication. I can't defend or explain a concept to you that I don't hold.

 So stop making assumptions and try to be a little more clear, yeah?

Ok, so put on your big boy pants and suspend your disbelief for the time it takes to imagine that Trump dotes over Trudeau. Let's also assume that a vast majority of Americans think that a close relationship with Russia is bad, but a close relationship with Canada is good.

Trump can't tweet with Putin's dick in his tiny hands.

Trump can't tweet with Trudeau's dick in his tiny hands.

These 2 jokes (given the circumstances we are supposing for the sake of the discussion) are the exact same joke. Neither of them imply negativity. The only reason the relationship is viewed negatively is because of how YOU AND I feel about Trumps relationship with Putin.

 In fact, if you are capable, suspend your disbelief further to just take Trump out of it all together. That solidifies how poor your argument about what the joke implies is:

Leader A can't tweet with Leader B's dick in their tiny hands.

What can be gleaned from this? Does this imply negativity? No, it doesnt. As the previous 2 examples illustrate, A and B can be a positively perceived relationship or it could be a negatively perceived relationship. My point here, is that if a person thinks that joke inherently implies negativity, it is only because THAT PERSON holds some semblance of the idea that homosexuality is wrong or funny. Maybe it would be different in Zimbabwe or Iran, but we are not in Zimbabwe or Iran. Here, there are plenty of people (a majority) who do not think that joke implies negativity because they do not share the connotation that gay = bad or funny (we can just say stigmatized, that covers both).

If your point is that lgbt are an historically oppressed people and that this means that any joke describing a negatively perceived relationship in any lgbt manner is going to be an offensive joke, you are not entirely wrong. It will absolutely be viewed as offensive by SOMEONE. But none of that makes the joke inherently offensive. I can say that the sky is blue and someone who works night shifts will get offended because their sky is black with white dots. Did my statement create the feeling of being offended? Yes. Was my comment offensive? No.

Now, as to implicit homophobia: Yes, it is a real thing. Yes, it is possible for people to not see their own biases or prejusice. No, it is not what is going on here. As the examples above illustrate, the joke works without negativity. You seem to be completely hung up on the idea that there is no way the same joke would work without the percieved negativity, but it can and does. They are the same joke. Even the anonymous one can be easily deciphered by a person of even sub average intelligence. Leader A tweets. Leader A has tiny hands. Leader A is close somehow to leader B. 

The inherently negative connotation exists only in your mind. Let go of that shit man, homosexuality is not funny or bad. YOU are keeping the stigma alive. The joke was not inherently doing that. YOU are doing that.

I would argue that everything you are saying here does far more damage to keeping those negative connotions alive than the joke... because I don't think most people thought anything about the equating of homosexuality to any stigmatization until you brought it up."

How? Jehovah's Witnesses deny any single common ancestor or that man came from apes. They don't deny genetic changes as a result of changes in diet and environment as is obvious within dogs. You should be asking yourself why evolutionists attempt to trace back to a common ancestor by graphically shrinking various skulls to make them seem to grow/shrink evenly as time goes on when in fact they vary in size tremendously back and forth depending on the time period they are discovered in.

I find it highly unlikely that something came from nothing, or that the extremely well-designed and intricate systems such as the laws of science, the human cell, the brain, earth and its environment and ecosystems, and many other systems could be the product of anything else but an intelligent creator. 

That would be like watching every ball on a billiard table from 1 to 15 go into each pocket of a pool table in clockwise and numerical order, then assuming that a skilled billiards player didn't make that amazing shot but all the balls spontaneously jumped into their places by some extremely vague and baseless cause."

">Well to be fair I already stated the post was too long to read in detail but I skimmed it and got the gist because I've heard all these arguments before, and your responses confirms that:

Then just read the parts relevant to what we are discussing. 

>Luke: The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Meaning, Luke had been so successful, was such a legend, that when the son of Han and Leia, his own nephew, turns to the dark side and destroys everything, I believe that Luke, being a very emotional guy, would take it really hard and come to question everything he had previously believed.

He was emotional in the sense he was very empathetic but he had incredible control over his emotions, thats why Vader and sidious gave up on trying to turn him to the dark side. If Luke with little training had such incredible control over his emotions then he isnt going to completely mentally break to the point where he isnt even recognisable to who he used to be. Just because of what Kylo did. If what kylo did hurt him so much why would he then hide and leave Kylo to go off and do even worse things for the next few years ? Not only does it go completely against the empathetic part of Lukes character but giving up on Kylo goes against the never giving up on hope part of Lukes character and its by far the most logically dumb decision he could have made. 

>Rey: She certainly has less training than most people, but training isn't necessarily all that important. Anakin got lots of it but he still went wrong. 

Exactly he got a bunch of training and still had issues, that shows how important training is and how stupid it is that rey is so capable without any. 

>And he was already moving things with the Force and seeing things on a testing screen before he ever had any training, 

As if any of that is even close to what Rey did with no training ? 

>Luke could block lasers and blow up the Death Star and move things after a conversation with Obi-Wan, etc.

Again i covered this in my original post and last reply to you and you seem top have ignored it. 

>We didn't see him get much training from Yoda either. Like I said, the Force comes out in powerful people. It's consistent. 

He practiced for three years between ANH and ESB and was still barely able to move his lightsaber with tk. when hed just had those brief lessons from obi wan he needed hours just to move a noodle with tk. So how can you say its reasonable rey lifts dozens of tonnes of stone without strain with even less training ? Luke was so powerful he had the potential to surpass sidious the most powerful sith ever. But by comparison to Rey he looks weak and incompetent. 

>And TLJ certainly calls into question the value of dogmatic training.

It never questions it at all...it just stomps on it to make rey super powerful and destroy any tension or challenge Rey may face. How can you seriously think needed to train for years to competantly use the force is worse than just having anyone become uber powerful in days ?

>I can't think of any reason why Rey being powerful could bother someone so much unless they're bothered by having a really powerful female character.

For the many reasons i've given but you havent read...

>If Finn was a woman and Rey was a man, in other words, if the man was much better at everything than the woman, it might be sexist because that's been done so many times before. The situation being reversed isn't sexist; it's a much needed corrective breath of fresh air.

Except the issue isnt making a man way more competent than the woman or vice verse. Its making one character way more competent that the other in every way. Is Luke was a better pilot, mechanic and talker than Han that would be an issue because Han would be redundant. 

>Leia: Used the Force to pull herself towards something in zero gravity. That's not that big of a Force power.

Again ignoring all the explanation i gave as to why its ridiculous. If you arent going to read my original post don't bother replying. Im not going to skip out points and evidence from my arguement because you cant be bother to read it.

>Snoke: I'm glad he was killed off because he was uninteresting. Focusing on Kylo and Rey was much more interesting than telling Snoke's backstory, which Rian Johnson realized. I'm sure it will be told some day, but it didn't need to be told in this movie. It's fine that you want to know more.

Its clear you aren't even reading my replies let alone my original post. my last reply on this comment perfectly counters what you just said ""You're are glad about that because he's just be made to be diet sidious and they did nothing with him that made him interesting despite all the potential he had. As it's seems apparent you haven't actually read my post I said I had no issue with snoke being killed off. My issue is killing him off before making him any sort of an interesting charatcer and not explaining how the hell he undid all the achievements of the ot hero's and reset it to a worse version of its ANH state.instead he just pops out of nowhere and it just all happens due to all the hero's being incredibly incompetent all of a sudden.""

>Holdo: It's not dumb of her not to tell Poe, because she is not responsible for his actions. He chooses to be distrustful, to be arrogant, to be unprofessional, and to be mutinous. 

She started insulting him immediately, pointed out he's hot headed and still did so anyway. Then later acts as though she has no plan at all which would certainly mean the death of them all. Why wouldnt poe try to save everyone in that situation ?

>Her responding to him the way she did when he rudely demanded information from her was exactly the right way to respond. It's as simple as that. 

Either you need to rewatch the scene or you are just making things up. He didn't rudely demand information from he. He walked up to her introduced him self politely and quietly asked what the plan was so ""he could do his part"" she starts insulting him then he again politely says he just wants to know what the plan is so he can help. She then goes and insults him again. Later on when poe see her loading people on transports poe points out how thats suicide and she acts as though she has no trick up her sleeve that will make it work. She purposely acted in a way that would convince him she was dooming everyone to death. Now how do you think the person she admitted was a hot head, who now hates her because all shes done is insult him will react to being convinced shes dooming the entire resistance to death ? 

>And no, he didn't save the fleet, he risked it. If the dreadnought follows them through hyperspace, as I'm sure you'll reply, they may attack it then in the same way, or a different way

If poe had retreated when leia said they still would have lost bombers retreating and then when the dreadnaught followed them through hyperspace they would have had to close the distance all over again from scratch and they would have stood no chance of destroying it as they barely managed the first time. You seem to have fogot leia originally wanted poe to go through with this plan and only changed her mind when the plan was nearly complete. So yeah he did save the fleet by doing that.


Fathiers: They used them to escape. Freeing them was just a nice bonus. More worth celebrating than just destroying the casino. That was the point.

again you seem to have ignored what i said, so you saying the main reason rose freed them as a distraction but the film just decided to focus and celebrate them being freed (to inevitably be captured later that day) instead of destroying the casino and rose and finn escaping which actually have positive consiquences., Do you see the mental gymnastics you are doing here ?

>Rose/Finn: I did read it. Apparently you didn't read mine. There is no chance that Finn was going to do anything to the cannon. It wasn't going to work. That was the point. That's why Poe and Rose called him back. That's why Rose stopped him.

jesus dude getting you to make a coherent counter argument is painful. i want to have a smart and civil discussion but you either seem to be trying to deliberately antagonise me with incompetence or you aren't capable of forming a proper counter argument. Explain why stopping finn is the smarter move when he has some chance of weakening or destroying the canon rather than leaving it 100% which dooms everyone. Even if its a 1/1000 chance its still way better than nothing and it finn dies regardless so she wasnt even saving him. Unless you have some points which prove stopping finn somehow increases the chance of the canon not working then you have no counter argument"
">Brexit: a coup by one set of public schoolboys against another

>To understand the situation the UK has got itself into, it helps to know that Brexit isn’t simply an anti-elitist revolt. Rather, it is an anti-elitist revolt led by an elite — a coup by one set of public schoolboys against another.

>I went to university with both sets, and with hindsight I watched Brexit in the making. When I arrived at Oxford in 1988, David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove had just left the place. George Osborne and the future Brexiters Jacob Rees-Mogg and Daniel Hannan were all contemporaries of mine. 

>I wasn’t close to them, because politically minded public schoolboys inhabited their own Oxford bubble. They had clubs like the Bullingdon that we middle-class twerps had never even heard of. Their favourite hang-out was the Oxford Union, a kind of children’s parliament that organises witty debates. A sample topic: “That sex is good . . . but success is better”, in 1978, with Theresa May speaking against the motion. May is now running for Tory leader without the usual intermediate step of having been Union president, though her husband Philip, Gove and Johnson did all hold that post. (Beautifully, Gove campaigned for Johnson’s election in 1986.)

>You could recognise Oxford Union “hacks” by the suits they wore, though none took it as far as Rees-Mogg, a rail-thin teenager who promenaded along Broad Street dressed like a Victorian vicar with an umbrella. Three times a year, when the Union elected new officers, the hacks would go around town tapping up ordinary students with the phrase, “May I count on your vote?” The traditional climax of a Union election was one Etonian backstabbing another for the presidency.

>It’s no coincidence that the Houses of Parliament look like a massive great Gothic public school. That building is a magnet for this set. Whereas ordinary Britons learn almost no history at school except a UK-centric take on the second world war (as evidenced in the Brexit debate), the Union hacks spent their school years imbibing British parliamentary history. Their heroes were great parliamentarians such as Palmerston, Gladstone and Churchill. I don’t think most Union hacks dreamed of making policy. Rather, Westminster was simply the sort of public-school club where they felt at home — or in the case of middle-class wannabes like Gove, aspired to feel at home.

>Their chief interest was oratory. From age six they had been educated above all to speak and write well. After Oxford, Union hacks usually found jobs in communications: Cameron went into PR, while Gove, Johnson and Hannan became journalists churning out the kind of provocative essays that are valued at Oxford. Osborne applied to do likewise at the Economist but was turned down at interview by my FT colleague Gideon Rachman. Only Rees-Mogg went into finance, possibly because his dad had already been editor of the Times.

>The autumn I started university, Margaret Thatcher gave her legendary anti-European “Bruges speech”, and this set began obsessing about Brussels. Ruling Britain was their prerogative; they didn’t want outsiders muscling in. Tory “Euroscepticism” is in part a jobs protection scheme akin to Parisian taxi drivers opposing Uber.

>The public schoolboys spent decades trying to get British voters angry about the EU. But as Gove admitted to me in 2005, ordinary voters never took much interest. Perhaps they didn’t care whether they were ruled by a faraway elite in Brussels or ditto in Westminster. And so the public schoolboys focused the Brexit campaign on an issue many ordinary Britons do care about: immigration. To people like Johnson, the campaign was an Oxford Union debate writ large. Once again, their chief weapons were rhetoric and humour. In Britain, humour is used to cut off conversations when they threaten either to achieve emotional depth or to get boring or technical. Hence Johnson’s famous, “My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it”, a line that doesn’t seem quite so funny now.

 . . . 

>The moment Brexit was achieved, Johnson and Hannan airily informed Britons that immigration would continue after all. No wonder, because the public schoolboys don’t care about immigration. Whether Poles and Bangladeshis live in unfashionable English provincial towns is a matter of supreme indifference to them.

>The public schoolboys turned out to have no plan for executing Brexit. I’m guessing they considered this a boring governance issue best left to swotty civil servants. Johnson actually spent the Sunday after Brexit playing cricket. In the great public-school tradition, he was a dilettante “winging it”.

>Now Britain seems headed for recession. When I mentioned this in an email to a privately educated Oxford friend, he chastised me: “You seem unduly concerned about short-term financial impacts. This is a victory for democracy.” I see what he means. If you make £200,000 a year, a recession is just an irritation. But if you make £20,000, it’s a personal crisis, and if you now make £15,000, then soon you may be struggling to feed your children.

>Anyway, the public schoolboys have already moved on to the Tory leadership election. “May I count on your vote?” What fun! "
">It's not like saying feminists should merge with LGBT people (though there's a lot of overlap there), it's like saying Republicans should merge with Democrats.

But this is EXACTLY the problem with how men's and women's issues are being presented--as a zero sum. And I fundamentally disagree that it is zero sum. I hear what you're saying in the case of rape prosecution, and that is a special case. But with other issues prominent to feminism (right to choose, wage gap [and please let's not get derailed on whether/why it is a thing, that is NOT the point here], underrepresentation) and the MRM (custody, incarceration/sentencing bias, conscription), there isn't a tradeoff. They're separate. Sure, if we increase representation of women, proportionally the representation of men goes down, but if they're still overrepresented, I don't see that as a problem unless the way we increased representation was unjust in the first place--in which case we should be working on fixing the problem more equitably for EVERYONE's interests. I think cases where men's and women's rights are fundamentally in opposition are the minority. If you could show that this is not the case, and that more feminist societies oppress men, you would almost certainly CMV.

>I think making a separate movement makes more sense. It gets attention! It results in posts like yours! But if I went onto r/feminism and started criticising, I'd be banned (actually that already happened).

The problem is that often it gets the worst KIND of attention. It got mine, in a reasonably positive way, all things considering... But I don't think my experience is normal. I think that most people hear about the MRM and laugh, because the movement has made a mockery out of real complaints. Some of that is because of the extremists, just as with feminism... But it's hard to deny that misogyny is front and center in the MRM. In the public consciousness, the MRM is a far bigger joke than feminism. If the MRM were the source of positive attention, I'd feel differently, but almost everyone I've ever met IRL who has brought up the MRM brought it up as a fringe group on par with the WBC."

"Hi, I'm coming from /r/amibeingdetained, but I want to see if this sub can have an open debate here instead of using your disagree buttons. I see things from a different perspective than most of you see it, as I sympathize with the cops in this situation. Let me start by analyzing the video as I see it. Cops notice an empty beer can next to a car so they suspect the guy in the vehicle. The guy says it wasn't me but the cops are suspicious. Nobody wants a potentially drunk person behind the wheel. The guy refuses to exit the vehicle (his first mistake) to simply be checked for intoxication. (Probably to do a breathalyzer test and that balance test) Yes this is an inconvenience to the potentially innocent man in the car, but it's better to waste a guys time then to have a drunk driver killing someone and ruining lives. Since he refused to budge force was required to make him exit his vehicle to be checked for intoxication. Now, it may seem that the man was going along with what the cops wanted but there is no reason that they would tackle him to the ground unless he was resisting (his second mistake). If he remained calm and didn't resist he would have been helped out of his vehicle and perhaps sat on the ground. However it is obvious that he continued to struggle against the cops. At this point ""extra"" force was used in order to stop him from breaking free and potentially attacking them. Their objective was to get him on his stomach and get his hands behind his back. Obviously he was resisting so he fell and in turn fell unconscious. He had plenty of opportunities to just listen to the cops and everything would have gone over smoothly. However he resisted and that's why things ended up how they did. I challenge you fellow reader to tell me how the cops could checked the man for intoxication given the mans stubbornness and aggressiveness. Please don't respond with they had no reason to suspect him because that's a moot point. He had the potential of being intoxicated and no one wants intoxicated people at the wheel. 

Edit: I just read the description on that video and it turns out that he had 4 firearms and a knife on him. Imagine what he could have done with those had the cops not taken the course of action as they did. Being a cop you always have to be careful because something terrible can happen at any time"

"I agree. 

She is pretty inconsistent and seems more like a plot device rather than a well-rounded character. (I feel that way about Hamlin too.) You can't exactly say who she is and what her motivations are, especially when it comes to her relationship with Jimmy.

When I first watched the show - I binge watched all the 3 seasons - the show putting Jimmy in a relationship with Kim came as a surprise to me and didn't make much sense for me. Considering Jimmy's character evolution, what they were going for in season one seemed like the right way: he was a struggling lawyer in financial troubles, everybody told him he was like a shady person/lawyer, his brother and personal idol turned out to be among that crowd too, his best friend passed away, and the girl he liked rejected his offer for a partnership. Jimmy's character was at a perfect point to enter the next phase of his evolution. But in season 2 they suddenly backpedaled.

Now, I have a theory of my own! Watching the show and reading some interviews by Gilligan (and Gould) gave me the feeling and the idea that the show creators, Vince Gilligan especially, became so fascinated by and interested in Michael McKean's performance as Chuck that they wanted to give him more storylines and to keep him around longer to act as the mentally ill and vindictive older brother. (because if you come to think of it, as a supporting character, Chuck had kind of served his purpose by the end of season one. He had dissed and rejected Jimmy and that was one of the main things that put Jimmy’s journey to the dark side in motion.) 

Gilligan himself said in an interview that initially Chuck was never intended to be the villain of the piece the way he turned out to be, he was supposed to be a normal, albeit ill, brother to Jimmy, but watching McKean act out Chuck with a hint of arrogance in his first scenes with Odenkirk gave them the idea to write Chuck the way they did. Now, in order to have more of McKean as the arrogant and mentally ill brother, they had to postpone Jimmy's character development and to give him something to do, hence the Davis and Main storyline and his relationship with Kim as well as Kim getting more screen-time and storylines herself. And as you said, by the time they got to season 3, the Kim character and the Kim-Jimmy relationship had become too popular to let go.

Also you can focus on core issues, as you said that is necessary sometimes. But as far as things like women's rights in the work place. Why can't you just fight for equal rights in the work place? If an employer is discriminating someone for being a woman that still falls under the same breach of law. It also equally protects men, transgender etc etc. Labelling is often detrimental as it influences people to subconsciously see differences that shouldn't matter.

Relating to forward moving cultural change I feel will cloud your view on the truth you read. Looking backward may provide a different perspective. The Word was written to people working under the one sex understanding, which (from how I'm understanding you) leads to the statements in the Word meaning a lot more than ""no homosexuality"". Really it leads to warn men against all the things that will degrade their manhood and ultimately their witness. 

Do you think scripture should be viewed user the cultural filter by which it was written, or should it be reimaged and read under the culture of the given day?

My point that I so poorly fumbled around was this: I feel like scripture should be read under a glass of truth. That you should examine what it's meaning was at the time of writing and still apply that today, despite whatever today's culture deems good and acceptable. "
"Thanks for sharing this! It's interesting because I think theists and atheists alike could agree that there is SOMETHING at the root of all these things. Theists call it ""God"" and atheists call it ""the Big Bang"" for the most part. We all recognize something larger than ourselves but we differ in what we call it and any extra beliefs associated with it. 


I'm pantheist; I believe that what Catholics call God is man's personification of the natural world so that humans can relate to it better. Some branches of pantheism believe that the natural world IS God (rather than it being his creation), so if you're familiar with Taosim, there are similarities with that. 

Personally, I find the Judeo-Christian God to have many human-like qualities and I don't see any rational reason to believe that this force, whatever it is, would be so like us. That seems to be a very human-centric way of thinking, and we are very small. We now know that there are probably around 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets in the universe, and the Bible only talks about one. And of that one, it only mentions the things that humans in a limited region of the world happened to know about 2000 years ago. If we take the Bible to be the Truth of the universe's creator, I'm bothered by its lack of scope. I would expect it to be more comprehensive. Combined with the fact that humans have believed in numerous gods throughout time, some monotheistic, some polytheistic (fun aside- archaeologists have found references to ""Yahweh"" as part of the Caananite pantheon of gods from the Bronze Age and his emergence as the one God of monotheistic traditions coincided with attempts to unify the polytheistic tribes and consolidate power), but I see nothing to suggest that any one instance is more ""correct"" than the others. Could this tradition be the ""right"" one? Sure, I suppose. It just strikes me as a very unlikely scenario. 

But I do believe that we are part of the universe, and through human (and possibly other species') intelligence and learning about the natural world the universe consequently has some degree of self-awareness. Does self-awareness imply life? I think it might. Does it imply intent? Not necessarily. "

> Demonization of male sexuality.

That is widely overblown by feminists, an argument exacerbated when you guys respond with even more vitriol.

> Ever-expanding definitions of ""sexual assault"".

That's not oppression, hon. The media might expand sexual assault definitions, but the definition by law hasn't changed. You're not going to be arrested, charged and convicted of rape if you kiss a drunk girl. You're a big boy, you know what you're allowed to do and what you're not allowed to do. And if you have to ask yourself ""will this get me in trouble?"", the answer is yes, don't do it.

> Entire departments in Universities whose sole person is to demonize men and dream up new ways of hurting them.

Do these departments have names?

> Discrimination in the form of affirmative action.

That is not oppression. That's a misunderstanding of how affirmative action works. Affirmative Action is a set of policies that ensure that employers don't simply discount someone as a work candidate because of their background. It also sets out guidelines that direct employers to remain objective when terminating employment. It was put in place because of nationwide concerns that employers were passing over candidates who were more qualified because of sex, race, or disability, and were setting priorities for termination based on the same things. That has now changed, and the culture of business has changed, but I don't think legislators are comfortable rescinding that policy because no one trusts that business will not revert to its past culture.

> Complete lack of reproductive rights.

You have the right to bodily integrity and autonomy. You have parental rights as a father on a child's birth certificate. You just don't have the right to violate a woman's bodily integrity in order to defend your claim to your DNA. See, one human right cannot infringe upon another. That's contradictory. The rules of our society have been as clear as rules get, long before any of us became sexually active. If you produce a child, you are responsible for it. That is the child's right, which you must also respect, if you value rights.

> Biased family courts that frequently result in fathers being denied access to their children while still being forced to subsidized their ex-wives.

That is a grossly oversimplified description of the problem, but we have one solid example now.

> Not being permitted to vote without signing your body over to the state.

That's not a men's rights issue. That's a citizenship-level issue. In Canada and many other nations, you are not required to sign up for the ""draft"", as no draft exists. We only have to pay our taxes in order to vote. In Switzerland, all citizens serve at least 12 months.

> Relative lack of services provided by the state, even though men pay the majority of taxes.

...this one is definitely a one-sided view of the issue. Women complain of the same thing, that services are extremely poor, and not worth the money paid into them. Furthermore, the term ""majority"" is misleading, as the difference is slim. Remember, the ""23% wage gap"" idea is a wholly flawed statistic.

> Relative lack of money devoted to male health care and male-specific cancer.

Citation, please.

> Male domestic violence victims often being arrested rather than seeing their abusers punished.

Is this really a common occurrence, or is it a highly publicized rarity?

There's little that can be done. You're in America, do what Americans do. Sue the shit out of her. You make it seem like you want her strung up in the town square at high noon as recompense. We don't do that any more.

> Little or no redress for male victims of sexual assault, including boys (if the perpetrator is female).

What about all the articles that get posted here cheering that another woman and then another, and then another get the jail time they deserve (or complaining about how the outlet didn't call it a rape)?

If you want to call failed redress of sex crimes a rights issue, then it's not a men's rights issue, as women have the same complaints that you do; that rape is underpunished and that perpetrators walk free too often. Neither of you are wrong.

> Treated much, much more harshly by the criminal justice system.

I was led to believe that it wasn't a ""too harsh on men"", it was a ""too soft on women"" problem. Remember, we're dealing with criminals. We shouldn't be talking ""too harsh"" with people who violate the law. Men who go to jail serve a fair sentence - sometimes too fair. Women get kid-gloved, which is what needs to change.

> Homeless men in some cities denied access to female only shelters.

Homeless shelters in 'some cities' is a far cry from oppression. The female-only shelters don't exist ""because fuck men"". They exist because at-risk women exist. If all the homeless shelters in a city are full and a homeless guy can't register at a female-only shelter, that's very sad, but it's hardly oppressive.

> lol no. It's because (a) MRA's legitimately challenge gender roles (female hypoagency, male disposability, women are wonderful, men are brutes) whereas feminists mostly perpetuate them and (b) MRA's debunk feminist theory, and feminism is a billion dollar industry. 

Okay, that's just conspiracy claptrap. You're just as dismissive of feminist accusations of ""toxic masculinity"" as they are of your accusations of ""male disposability"". The rest of us on the sidelines are just looking amongst ourselves asking, ""What is this, a hipster convention meets a political rally?""

> Feminist fantasies are irrelevant. There is zero justification for viewing us in such a fashion. Conversely feminists really are abusive, wether calling for genocide against males, blocking laws that would allow fathers to spend more time with their children, or illegally shutting down conferences on male suicide.

Really? I'm not even a feminist and discussions here have led MRA users to become abusive and threatening. So yeah, I don't agree in the slightest that there's zero justification for viewing you that way. I've also had the joy of being harassed and threatened by feminists during my early exploits on reddit, so I can say that you both have a lot of PR work to do. Sorry, but pointing out a handful of feminist protests at MRA conferences and referencing a handful of loonies trying to assert genocide and population control as actually viable responses to the problems facing the culture of the time, doesn't inspire a lot of confidence about your position.

It sounds like your point of view is ""they don't act mature, so why should we?""

> This claim can be made of a few visible MRA's like Karen Straughan and Paul Elam. However there is nothing intrinsically ""right wing"" about about the MRM.

Then why are so many users here hinged against the left? In almost every post I see it's ""left-wing cuck"" this, and ""liberal shill"" that. Non-MRA conservatives don't hate liberals that much and they actually have something to gain from it.

> No it wouldn't. The average man has no power at all.

Right, I forgot. The American political system is driven by money. That's why only rich people get to be politicians and the richest peopl--- oh, right, they're also mostly men.

> To the extent that men in power try to privilege one sex it is women (males have out-group bias toward females). Hence the smashing success of feminism and the miserable failure of the MRM.

Actually, it's because feminism spent decades endearing itself to the public before it twisted into the ugly sneering visage full of blue hair dye that it is today. MRM skipped that first step where they got people to like them first, and went right to the ugly, complete with abrasive hateful behaviour and death threats.

It's like Hollywood. People will tolerate you being a prissy, fussy, hard-to-work-with actor if you're a multimillion-dollar success with Oscars on your mantle. But if you're a prissy, fussy, hard-to-work-with actor on your first job, your ass will be fired.

> It makes no difference if you replace a male politician with a female politician; both will cater to women over men (females have in group bias).

If that's the case, then pro-women sexism will remain indefinitely, and you're wasting your time, isn't that true? If both groups have a pro-women bias that's built into the psyche, then men will never be considered equal and the last 5000 years of history is just men having the initial edge before civilization settles in and puts them where they belong.

That doesn't sound very optimistic to me.

> The reason men are hostile to ""diversity"" efforts is because we value the ideas of meritocracy and justice.

Meritocracy is an ideology, and one not everyone needs to believe in. The idea that you have to put something in in order to get something out, unfairly disadvantages people who have already been disadvantaged from the beginning. The game was stacked against them from day one.

Have you, for a moment, considered that the reason this game gets so much positive feedback and hype is because it's a genuinely good game that is now suffering under a horrible release schedule and poor marketing? Have you thought about the possibility that there are people out there who are having tremendous fun with a game they are afraid isn't going to survive long because nobody gives it the attention they think it deserves? That someone wishes to share the excitement and enjoyment they've gained from the title with other people, trying to give it exposure in order to support a developer they feel deserves that support?

I would think that the burden of proof would rest on someone claiming ""it is impossible for a woman to be overconfident."" Studies which show trends certainly aren't proof of this.

I'm not saying it is a controversial statement, I'm saying that it's speculative to think that that will skew the overall results to a large degree. It's not controversial to say that there likely exists some women who overestimate their own ability, but generally speaking it's not the case, which is what we're looking at here. Or at least it was what I was talking about. If we're talking about something different than I apologize.

Nobody seems to have any problem with the notion that OP is castigating every Trump supporter on the basis that he believes that modern conservatism is just an Ayn Rand book. It just strikes me as rich when OP is bluntly telling the Trump supporter that he is naive about what his party represents, when OP himself is making incredibly broad assumptions about conservative ideology.


I realize I am flirting with the 'no true Scotsman' fallacy, and OP is generally right that the average citizen equates conservatism with individual responsibility, small government, and low taxes.

"This is so frustratingly disingenuous. 

She spent a significant amount of time unemployed, by choice, so she could make a passion project. Her boyfriend paid the majority of the bills and also, presumably, didn’t do any housework, which caused her to become annoyed and led to arguments. She credits her annoyance to her being a feminist. The subject of her passion project was learning about the anti-feminist internet movement, and thus credits her changing her mind about chores and bills to renouncing feminism. As a feminist who has no problem with fairness in bills/chores, this makes me facepalm. 

First, I have questions. I think it’s fair for the person who pays the majority of the bills do less chores. But that doesn’t give them the right to be a total slob of a human being. So I’m curious just how much of a mess her boyfriend was making and expecting her to clean up, since this led to multiple arguments. If he puts his dirty laundry in the hamper and his dirty dishes in the sink, fine. Or does he just leave gross shit laying all over the house? Does he let stuff rot and go stinky is she’s not home for a few days? So I’d need more details before writing off her annoyance. I think it’s perfectly fair for the person who pays less (especially if it’s way less or nothing) in bills to handle the bulk of the chores, but that shouldn’t turn them into a mothermaid who has to pick up dirty laundry and dirty dishes off the floor like you’re their parent. An adult in a relationship is still responsible for basic respectful things like that.

So let’s give the guy the benefit of the doubt, that he’s respectful about not making chores even more of a pain than they need to be and functions like an adult. My next question would be wanting to know how the arguments went down. Because even if he’s putting his dirty laundry in the hamper, I’d like to know how he expresses his opinion that she should be the one to run the washer/dryer. Is it because he pays the bills, or is it because he thinks women should be the one who washes clothes regardless? She says she came to the bill inequality conclusion on her own, so what did this guy say in his own defense during their fights?

And like... feminism isn’t newsletter. It isn’t even a consensus. Feminists argue amongst themselves, a lot. It’s how change happens, it’s how the dialogue moves forward. There are different kinds of feminism. So for this woman who thought it was unfair for her to have to do more chores despite not paying bills to blame that on feminism, I call foul. It sounds like she herself was an immature person who hadn’t really thought things out clearly, and had some growing up to do. As a feminist who feels the way she does now about chores and bills yet is still a feminist, I think she just found an easy scapegoat to blame for her past immaturity, and it’s been being reinfocred by all the anti-feminist men telling her how cool and smart she is for renouncing feminism. It sounds like she had a pampered rich girl upbringing. This is what 4th wavers call pretty white girl feminism, all the indignance, none of the struggle.

"It seems like you're privileging pain as the aspect that distinguishes anal sex from other types of sacrifice/compromise. As many in this thread have done already, I'll point out again that anal sex shouldn't be painful if you're doing it right. 

I'll also add that I don't particularly privilege pain over other types of physical, emotional, or intellectual distress. I suspect that many men feel this way, possibly due to childhood socialization (being ridiculed for showing signs of pain etc), which is possibly where the 'wimp' reaction comes from. If you hide behind 'it hurts' rather than a more mature/complete discussion of how it makes you feel, why you are resistant to the idea in general, what you want out of your sexual relationship and in what ways you both will or won't sacrifice for each otehr and what compromises you can come to as a couple, then yeah, it sorta sounds like you're just being a wimp about the pain, which is something we're used to ridiculing people for. I agree that's not a constructive way to address the situation, but if that's the only thing we're given to work with, then it's hard to be more constructive.


Separating pain from general sacrifice/discomfort, I'd just like to point out by way of analogy that men who refuse to perform cunnilingus for any reason - smell, squickiness, tongue/jaw fatigue, etc - are universally ridiculed and derided, much more uniformly than women who refuse anal sex. I think it's a general reaction to someone who won't do something that seems like a small sacrifice in order to make their partner very happy. I think the difference for anal sex is that there's more ambiguity because it can be extremely painful if done wrong, so there's a lot of miscommunication in threads like this where one person is imagining something gruesome and awful while the other is imagining something mild and straightforward."

Patriarchy. Men oppress women. Is that not what it means at its most basic core? ""Women cannot be sexist towards men because sexism= power+privilege.""

I agree with this but calling it ""Patriarchy"" just isn't right. There is an outright denial of the very real and very tangible power that women hold and have always held.

>Patriarchy is the ideological societal belief that men are more suited to taking a dominant role - this doesn't even necessarily imply that they have more economic power; although this often ends up being a result.

Yes. It's an ideological belief. It cannot be proven. It also cannot be falsified.

>>When you frame the discussion as Men vs. Women, you are actively avoiding the real problem: Capitalism

>When you frame the problem as only being capitalism, you are actively avoiding several other problems, such as sexism, racism, homophobia and the state. If you are happily or deliberately avoiding any of these problems, then you're not really advocating for anarchism, or even egalitarianism.

Excuse me? How is blaming men for all of those things anything less than utter bigotry?

>Which brings me nicely to the reason that anarchists have such disdain for MRAs. We recognise the problems they recognise, and we want to tackle them too. To us, they are the ones framing the debate as ""Men vs Women"", as you say, and not as ""feminism vs patriarchy"", as we would.

We're not framing the debate. You are. You just did. Feminism is an analog for femininity as patriarchy is of masculinity. You've outright decided that women (and the rest of the world) are simply the victims of the white man's oppression. 

>The issues they raise, from our point of view, are all quite obviously caused by patriarchy and the gender roles it brings with it - but because of a misunderstanding of patriarchy and feminism (or in a few cases, latent misogynism), they choose to blame women and feminism, instead of the actual cause of their problem. 

Here's the thing. You saying we have a misunderstanding of patriarchy is like Donald Trump saying you just don't understand capitalism. It's rather arrogant. The MRA's that I've heard talking about it (myself included) have done their homework.

You are writing off our criticisms of your ideology. This is the exact same as a Christian telling me I don't understand their religion even though I was raised Roman Catholic.

>In doing so, they're actively fighting against the solution to their problems.

Until feminists are willing to entertain that their ideology is flawed, they are actively fighting against the solution to their problems. 

Dissident opinions are non-existenent in academic teachings of Patriarchy in Gender Studies courses. When an ideology is being taught in school that actively avoids considering the position of the opposition, it's nothing more than indoctrination. It's alienating and why so much furor is raised towards Feminism as a whole.

Now I am not going to say all MRAs have the same beliefs I do. I also accept that not all feminists ignore the gynocentrism that exists.

I think Feminists and MRA's are equally guilty of refusing to meet in the middle. And in my opinion that middle ground is some kind of socialism.

Maybe in a few years when there is far less objectification of women in advertising and media then men will grow up to be able to be in a gym with a woman without staring at her - perhaps a woman will grow up and worry more about her health than what she looks like to the guy on the treadmill across the room.

I'm not a radical feminist by any means but it's not too hard to see women being the sex object and men being the dominant one in ads. 

The Muslim religion tries to teach modesty, to avoid this from becoming something a woman keeps thinking about. Even if perhaps the men in the gym aren't objectifying her she still may be thinking about how to make her look good for someone else besides herself. 

NOTE ABOUT YOUR EDIT: Religious fundamentalists banning gays is a ban against someone for being who they want to be. Whereas a man-free zone for 6 hours allows women to be more who they want to be and not who they're expected to be. 

But you raise a good point - Perhaps there should be a 6 hour male-only period. 

However, I don't think there are many guys who feel threatened when woman are around. Perhaps men don't feel threatened because of a few reasons - they don't react to the idea of whats supposed to be beautiful - perhaps it's because the pressure to feel beautiful is focussed more on women which results in the women asking for some time alone - or perhaps they're too afraid of anything homosexual and so the more women around the more comfortable with themselves they can be. 


Edit - I've come to realize that men can feel the same objectification and decided a 6 hour men-only period should also be put into affect. "

"Hmmm, no not really. I would understand the question even better. If a Japanese person would ask if I knew any Japanese artists, I would interpret that as an intro into something that that person knows from their background. That person probably identifies with Japanese culture and sees it as part of themself.

Your question is interesting and I think I get where you are pointing.

> Would a woman asking about whether you like any women artists be that different? Why or why not?

Yes it would be different. I associate Japanese creators with Japanese culture. I do not associate female creators with female culture (or rather typical women content). Men can direct chickflicks or write romantic novels. Just like women can make action movies etc.

If the Japanese person would, after the question, suggest a Japanese artist that made American-style content I would be surprised. I would've assumed it was about the Japanese nature of the content, not the nature of the creator (yes, even though the person specifically said Japanese artists)

I believe sexism is a huge issue. Especially harassment and in the workplace (unequal pay and unequal career potential). I don't feel sexism is as much of a problem in the music, movie and literature industry. It is when concerning the issues of the workplace, but not as much concerning what the public likes.

Sexism is a massive issue and is definitely something one should screen for when dating, but I think it's more prevalent in other areas than the creators of their favorite content. There are huge sexists around that happily read Harry Potter, written by a woman, with a boy as main character, a man as mentor and a man as villain. Whereas they might not like Spirited Away or any other of Miyazaki's movies, made by a man, all with a girl as main character and mixed mentors and villains. This example might suit my argument, but that's because I merely argue that the gender of the creator is not a deciding factor for the content.

Like you said in your reply before. It depends on the context of the profile. If it has an unlikely high amount of men listed, the question is fitting. If the men aren't all listed, but instead also titles and it's reasonably possible that they're all men by chance (not by sexist motives), the question can be interpreted as an accusation. I think that's why there's such a huge discussion about the usefulness of this advice from Captain Awkard."

"I´m not saying that everyone should draw their one book covers, I´m saying that all types of art should ideally be shared freely around the world without any monetization, because as soon as money is involved in the production of art there is a good chance that the artists creativity will be corrupted. I don´t mind spending a few bucks on an album or painting I like, but the album should´ve been made without the aim of generating money. When hobbies turn into jobs and artists become dependent on their creative output there´s a good chance that the quality of said creative output will significantly drop. I´ve seen that often enough, e.g. in unnecessary sequels to books (or as said before in mediocre commission paintings by otherwise great artists) which were solely made for the purpose of making a living. Sure call me a fucktard but at least tell me why this is not ""well tought out at all"". No one should aim to build a career focussed on the production of art, if it turns out to be very successful that´s one thing but solely creating art with the intention of making money is just wrong.

I´m aware that this is all very idealistic but in a world where you can´t even collab with someone for fun without that person asking for 100$ (for a free track) there is something deeply wrong with the way people experience creativity.

>just trying to explain how you're coming off as a bit illogical.

Except it's not illogical. The way that every player can make a world shared by different players look however they like is stupid. Every server should have an objective reference point for all players. This is done in every other online game, and minecraft should be no exception.

>And people use their own texture packs all the time on multiplayer.

That doesnt change the fact we should have the option to disable player texture packs working on our server. People could even theme their servers how they liked. The current implementation is an inconsistent mess.

>That sounds rather demanding of you, like it's a personal offense to you that people will and do use texture packs other than the default, and therefore ruining your image of the game.

But divisions between the lower middle class and working class who have nearly always worked and those who are reliant on benefits long term are stoked by the media and seem strong. Same difference in many ways. 

>working class identities are more acknowledged and celebrated, so the obstacles that stand in their way are easier to understand and discuss 

Yet a lot of these problems exist because manual trades are less respected (than in unnamed countries where people are encouraged to think they are lower middle class???) and state schools and housing provision are in a mess. 

So class problems are more easily recognised because there is more social division... sounds like a vicious circle. 

Discussion of class is often nebulous because for some reason there still isn't a proper understanding of economic class and cultural class as separate attributes and experiences, which don't necessarily match up in the same individual. Even commoner these days as many typically 'middle class' jobs in areas like academia and the arts are lower-paid and more fragmented than ever.

"> It's pretty true to be honest. The Orcs took very little convincing to commit genocide against the Draenei, even before they drank the kool aid. Duress is not a valid excuse for committing genocide either.

Ah yes, because the Draenei are totally innocent here. Never mind the fact that 2/3rd's of their population led by Archimonde and Kil'jaeden abused fel magics even more than the orcs did, and then made an attempt at manipulating a tribal race to be hostile to their escaped brethren. Blame the orcs for that!

> I mean the warchief that considers all the races as equally disposable. Sylvanas cares about literally no one but herself, and sees any and all of her subordinates as a shield to prevent her from getting what's coming to her (an eternity in Mega-Hell). She even steps over what she had previously considered a red line (raising Horde troops as undead) in BFA.

People need to stop bringing up this myth. Literally nobody knows what is coming to her. Or anyone for that matter. You could all be going to the same place, because where else is there to go? The vision she actually saw was watching her people being used as fodder without her there to protect them. She came back to prevent that from happening.

Why would she come back to prevent them from being made fodder, just to make them fodder? It's illogical. If she truly felt her troops were disposable how come she was the one who ordered the retreat at broken shore? How come she didn't leave anyone behind to cover her escape?

> Genn had due cause to attack Sylvanas, considering that he was acting on intel the Alliance PC recovers in Azsuna. She was also extremely close to alienating Odyn to the point where he may not have even handed over the Aegis of Aggramar at all, demanding some impossible trial, like ""bring me the head of Sargeras"".

Rofl no he didn't. His ""intel"" amounted to nothing more than ""Hey the forsaken are totally interested in something at X location"" He had no idea what they were doing. He goes in and attacks his allies pretty much blind because he's a paranoid moron. What is the worst that could happen? She can make some extra Valk'yre. Oh noooo! Considering how at this point she was still an ally to the alliance... what's the issue here?

Alienating Odyn? He's not very bright or good himself. He murdered and enslaved his daughters to make the first Valk'yre then brainwashed the mortals that worship him to fight and die for his causes. He knows the fate of the universe is on the balance and continues to demand pointless trials for his amusement. He's not all that powerful and if he ever became a problem to Azeroth he would just be a raid boss we'd actually get to kill, instead of just being a raid boss we have to bring to near death.

> I also mean humans. Arathor, the very first Human kingdom that antedated the Alliance completely, fought alongside Quel'thalas in the Troll Wars. The Blood Elves are also really good at making scapegoats, considering that they blamed the entire Alliance for the actions of Garithos alone, who was justified considering that Quel'thalas pulled out of the Alliance along with Gilneas and Stromgarde after the second war when the Orcs wouldn't get put down (which to be honest, seems strange that the Blood Elves tolerate the Orcs).

So let me get this straight. You hate how the bloodelves blame the entire alliance for the actions of Garithos alone.

But you think Garithos is justified for the actions against an entire race, for the choices of their elven leader abandoning an alliance which clearly didn't have the interests of his people in mind.

El oh el

I like how you bring up how you wonder why the elves can even tolerate the orcs. Probably because they can see the bigger picture and aren't close minded racists? They allied with the orcs despite being enemies. They allied with trolls despite being enemies. They allied with undead despite losing their capital to undead forces. Almost makes you wonder how unappealing the alliance must be to prefer their worst enemies over bending the knee to a human kingdom."

"I don't think I've ever met a black woman who consider ""straight and flowing as a European"" ideal for their hair, though I don't doubt it's the case in some places. 

But used as a basis to make braiding easier and for traditional ""black"" hairstyles, it is used as a basis for hairstyles that 1) in many cases, particularly braiding, has a history that pre-dates widespread contact between Europe and Africa by hundreds of years, 2) to a large extent is based on elaborate styling that explicitly avoids ""straight and flowing"" and that doesn't resemble European hairstyles at all.

In many places you will find weaves are looked down upon exactly because it is seen as the most similar to European hairstyles.

Now, there's little doubt that historically relaxing was used to some extent to look more European (which I also specifically mentioned), but the historical basis for the current popularity of relaxing is pretty clear. 

Books have been written on the subject (we have a couple - my wife cares deeply about her hair, it's a big part of her heritage and can go on about it for hours). 

The resurgence has largely come as expressing black identity in countries like the US and Britain has become more and more decoupled from a need to express a tie, however remote, to Africa

At the same time, urban black hairstyling has been exported back to Africa. My wife is Nigerian, and a large part of the hairstyles that she and her friends make use of were imported from the US. However to claim any of them look like ""white"" hairstyles would be outright silly.

> As a black woman who does not relax her hair I'd have to disagree with the breakage and the tangling part. My natural hair is way longer than my when my hair was relaxed because the harsh chemicals caused a lot of breakage.

You confuse two separate issues. If relaxing is done badly, yes, it will cause breakage, and may also cause burns and eventually bald spots. However, once the hair is relaxed, the result is stronger as the number of stress points in the hair are reduced. 

This is why relaxing the hair today is generally an integral part of preparing for braids and weaves, at least when done by someone remotely professional, even when the natural hair is completely covered and it so isn't necessary for aesthetic reasons at all. 

Whenever my wife is pressed for time she may get braids done without relaxing her hair, but if so, she always ""pays for it"" by taking the braids out much sooner than usual exactly for this reason - the hair starts breaking far sooner and easier under stress in that case.

> I spend way less time on my hair overall than I did when relaxed because I am no longer trying to get it to do things it just naturally cannot do.

I know perfectly well the steps to caring for properly relaxed African hair, and I've seen first hand both that and the amount of time caring properly for natural afro hair takes. I don't know how you can even compare the two. Properly done, caring for relaxed hair is as simple as oiling it every few days, packing it up at night, and brushing it first thing in the morning. 

My wife's natural hair takes more work than that by the time it's a few millimetres long.

"> Sorry, I think this is a common thing that happens with confirmation bias. Those who do that, seem to just decide that others are not using logical ordering themselves.

That's a difficult one to argue. I doubt JR's apparent certainty that he saw a fire on the Monday, mainly because of evidence from other reports that cast doubt on their impartiality. It also doesn't seen to add up to me, that he distinctly recalls a large fire on the Monday at 4:30pm, yet all the other initial witnesses, who were only meters away, make no mention of any fire. Now I would argue, that approach is rational and based on the evidence. However, because I believe Avery is innocent, my approach is considered proof of confirmation bias, therefore of no merit whatsoever, unless I changed my opinion to conclude there was a fire and that Avery is guilty. Do you see my problem? 

>I am clearly following an order and evaluating all data points. I have been very clear with you as to why I show lower confidence in certain data points and therefore apply less weight.

Like you, somethings I will give more weight to than others, although I don't consider any ""data points"" in isolation, but will attempt to see where they fit into the bigger picture, thereby allowing me to be a bit more precise as to what importance I might give them.

>You seem to have a whole different set of weight that you place on someone giving two different accounts of the same time/event. Confirmation bias can get you there imo.

With regard to two different accounts, I would generally accept someone first account as being the most reliable.

>You also want me to accept that Avery simply accepted there was a fire because everyone else said so. Fair to say that. However, I think the opposing argument of him admitting it, because others noticed it, is possibly more likely.

That argument is again based on the fact there WAS a fire on the Monday, which if you accept that, I would agree he might have had to admit there was one, because others noticed it. It what you don't seem to have considered, was what if there WASN'T a fire on the Monday. How does that all all fit? Initially, the only suggestion there was, is JR's account. It wasn't recorded, nor do we know when the report was actually written. You seem to have placed all your faith in that one report, to conclude there was a fire, even though we have at least seven people who initially make no mention of a fire. So why do you give 100% credit to one account, but 0% credit to seven accounts? If you did consider there was no fire Monday, then what would Steve and Brendan have done? Exactly, not mention a fire.

>What you don't see is me at times arguing YOUR side of the equation. Why do I do this? Because I am ok with questioning my own beliefs and I'm not trying to confirm a bias, but rather just evaluate the probability of either side. I make no conclusion. 

Not strictly true. You conclude there was a fire Monday, therefore conclude Avery and Dassey intentionally concealed that fact, to give one example. 

>You on the other hand? you've made a conclusion and are trying to change a mind that is not made up, but just plainly is playing devils advocate to yours.

This is not going well, as I disagree with you again! I made an argument that Dassey hadn't been coached, based in part from information that was know, but you concluded he had been. That's not playing devil's advocate as I see it. You could certainly express why you don't think he was coached, that would be playing devil's, but when you conclude he wasn't, that is just an opinion, the same as my opinion that he wasn't. 

>I see both what you are saying and what I am saying as still possible. I am also defining what I 'd like to know to get closer to raising/lowering probability of either side. I told you that I am open to actual evidence that JR might have a reason to lie etc. But you just saying ""maybe"", isn't pushing the needle. I hope you can understand. I'm even acknowledging he could have misremembered, but I'm not going to just assume that as you do, to confirm a bias. -- yes, I trust him more than the rest of the cast, because I haven't seen him make contradicting statements. For instance -- if it was shown that he couldn't possibly see avery's fire from the road to the deer camp, I'd be skeptical of him as it would now be a untruth. right?

I see the JR issue as far more narrow than you do. I don't know what he actually said, any more than you do, so all with have is a report that we should put our faith in. We can both accept the report as 100% correct, with the one minor exception on my part, as to whether the fire was on the Monday. As I said in the other post, the bus driver was 100% correct, with one minor exception, it wasn't Monday.

>You... on the other hand are as I said, just preaching the gospel of what you believe.

That is true, but I will give you an example of why I don't just accept everything without questioning it. Pam phones dispatch, Wiegert asks if the vehicle has any plates, or something like that. The argument was, how did he know the vehicle didn't have any plates! My argument was, that he may have simply been asking in an open ended way, rather than just assuming the vehicle had plates.

>Big difference. But nice try anyways on trying to paint me as a guilter. Sorry, might work with a guilter to just say ""you already believe he's guilty"", but not with me.

It wasn't a try, it's just that everything you seem to think, happens to point to Avery's and Brendan's guilt. I'm sure if we did a quick Q&A, you would see what I mean.

>If you continue that line of debate, then our reasonable talk is not really possible anymore. We both know you have made your mind up.

I agree, I have made up my mind, but would also be happy if someone could point out where I am wrong! I do try and choose my words carefully, like maybe, possibly, unlikely etc., etc., so not quite so set on everything as you might imagine.

"I could see how this could be mistaken for a bomb. All in all I don't think the police did anything wrong, and I think this whole event is blowing up because people are trying to make a case of racial profiling where there isn't one.

The police responded to reports of a suspicious device, which to the teacher and school administrators, Ahmed's device was. Reportedly, Ahmed said nothing more than that it was a clock. The police arrived and treated it like a hoax bomb, and followed their standard procedures. They cuffed him until they released him to his parents, pretty logical to me for what at the time they thought might have been a criminal. After everything was cleared up as a misunderstanding, the case is closed and no charges are being filed.

Someone help me understand - what am I missing?"
">If you think it's relatively easy to explain why Dawkins' criticism of Watson was misguided, then it shouldn't be too much trouble to do so.

We’ve already had this conversation in private, remember? But if you need a refresher:

1) If his goal is to convince feminists that they have misplaced priorities, he didn’t pick a smart strategy.

2) This is because viciously mocking an individual feminist for expressing a legitimate complaint is unlikely to win her over to your side. 

3) His letter was tone-deaf in that it implied that Watson had no right to complain about being mistreated while women in other parts of the world were being treated even worse. Even a strict Utilitarian should be able to see that we can address both problems at once, or simply ignore her problem and start working on the “real” problem rather than waste time chastising her. A smart utilitarian would know that shaming a woman for speaking about a problem in her life does not maximize happiness, because it’s more likely to make her resent him than listen to him. "

"There was a nice post on /r/bestof a while ago (that was surprisingly highly voted and 2x gilded) which went something like this:

People don't like vegans/vegetarians and want them to fail because generally they know that being vegan/vegetarian is better - hell, there was a post on /r/wtf today/yesterday which pictured how male chicks get murdered in the egg industry - the comments were absurd, too, rather than people clamouring to stop support of the egg industry, they'd rather have been ignorant of the process. People know it's a bad thing and that the treatment of animals is bad, but they want a way to justify it, basically.

Watching others fail at being vegan/vegetarian to some people warrants them not trying, as the bestof post illustrated.

Protein is obtainable from non-meat as much as it is from meat. Just because taking all the meat from a carnivore's diet would mean they had no protein doesn't mean vegans/vegetarians eat like that. A vegan/vegetarian meal is NOT an omnivore's meal but with the meat taken out...

There do exist vegan/vegetarian athletes, too.

"The title and general tone of the article is bullshit, I agree.


To answer your question, I think there is a general worry that some of the Szekely people are taught from young to hate Romanians, but more-so in (some of) their families rather than in school. As you can imagine, there is a small deal of that going on, just like some families will teach their kids that gypsies will steal them, Germans will kill them etc. Not enough to become a national issue, I believe.


But I do believe - based on the 10-20 (?) Szekely people I met that moved from the so-called Tinutul Secuiesc to other areas in Transylvania after their teens were over - that there is a sense of marginalization they experience, which hurts their relationships and carrier choices once - and if - they move out of that area. I have seen a couple of them try to move and work in Hungary, and then return disappointed from there as well. They sometimes find it hard to find their place in the world outside of their communities, which are quite traditional and close in general.


Obviously, this is an issue which should be resolved through proper government policies, but unfortunately we are not at the level of education and acceptance of Switzerland - the only country were I have seen a multi-cultural and multi-language society work excellently. 

As a parenthesis, just to present my view:

The largest part of the reason for the issues we are facing is language. 


Here, Romanians (myself included) will not learn Hungarian even when many of our colleagues in IT speak it natively, while in Switzerland the German-speaking people will learn at least French and sometimes also Italian (to a degree) in order to improve communication. I blame it on the difficulty of Hungarian language, jokingly.


As a result, or rather in the same manner, some of the Szekely people will not teach their kids Romanian at all. I can understand their frustration, but do not appreciate their reasoning, as they are hurting their kids future. 


Anyway, this language thing is the reason you will see Romanians outside of Transylvania be suspicious and overreact to small things like this. The solution seems very simple, but the will to admit it from both ""sides"" and work towards the solution is limited."
"Yes and if that were really the policy anywhere anymore, I can see why it might be upsetting. But most places have made it easier on their employees and implemented the ""card anyone under x age policy."" So by being carded it's not they look under 21, it's that they look under 50/65/x age. Which is really a complement even for a guy. If they want to buy beer or ciggarettes, they should have their ID. What are they going to do, blow up at the fresh new employee because he/she still follows the law to the letter? It's a ridiculous expectation to expect that a business is going to take risks in the name of convenience for a few customers.

I'm 23 and a girl and hardly ever get carded. I don't get upset when they do card me. At places that know me, and places that don't. I always have my license, and it only adds 2 seconds to the time spent as long as I don't whine and distract them from checking my age. "

"Stick to my example bank. Where does gold enter the equation? The bank debits a thing of value (fiat currency or gold) and credits a deposit liability. Whenever I ask questions here people always try to steer it to whatever thing they are currently into (it was bitcoin last time).

These two things can be true and are true at the same time! There are trillions of dollars in liquidity managed this way with zero problems! You must mean that we should require disclosure then? 

Ok, here we go again trying to shoehorn gold into it. The depositor gives the bank something of value, an asset. It can be gold, it can be fiat bills, it can be a cow. The bank provides them a liquid claim asset. The logic is the same. This isn't about fiat currency.

Steve Brannon, on his website states that the alt right is a movement against corporatist conservatives and for racial conservatives. His number one concern is keeping America a white nation, and supposedly preserving its culture. This is on his website. 

Trump is totally connected to racism. He had the largest housing discrimination suit of the 70s brought against him, his dad was arrested for being in the KKK in 1927, and he started the birther movement while Obama was President. He hired Steve Bannon on his show, has only lukewarmly disavowed the alt right (reluctantly, and after being repeatedly asked and pressured), and he's placed a guy who thought the KKK are good people as his Attorney General. So you are wrong, Donald Trump is a racist, and he is connected to the alt right. "
"Holy fuck the comments here are terrible. I'm pro choice but I completely understand the pro-life argument unlike a lot of the redditors in this thread talking shit about this couple.

Okay here's the deal. Pro lifers, for the most part, believe that a fetus at conception is a living human being that is alive. When they hear about abortions happening, they don't think of it as sac of non-conscious cells that we pro choicers see as a biological machinery, they think of it as a human being that is being ripped to shreds. They see it as murder. (Unrelated note: If you want to argue with a pro-lifer, stop telling them that a woman has a right to choose, and try telling them that a fetus isn't alive. Similarly, if you want to argue with a pro-choicer, stop victim blaming or saying that the baby can be put up for adoption or whatever, and start telling them that a fetus is a living human being.)

This couple wants to do something to stop what they see as murder. They are willing to put in the time, money, effort, sacrifice, etc... to raise a complete strangers baby because they think they are saving a human beings life, and you fuckers are shitting on them for it. "

"The LDS prophets have explicitly said that a previous prophet was wrong before. Look at Richard Packham's story about what happened when he discovered Brigham Young's teachings about how Adam is ""the only God with whom we have to do."" He brought it to the LDS church's leaders and they said ""no, that's false doctrine.""

(EDIT: Another example is any time the LDS Newsroom talks about previous teachings on racial inequality or exaltation.)

For another example, Joseph Smith spelled out exactly the law of celestial (plural) marriage in the Doctrine and Covenants, even though he was violating that law at the time that he said it.

I think every time this person laughed was when you'd scored a point. It must be an ingrained reflex against cognitive dissonance. You weren't even pointing out the obvious -- that a prophet who says black people aren't equal doesn't speak for a god worth listening to. You were showing the blatant contradictions in his own reasoning, and he didn't know how to deal with that except by retreating further into impenetrable doublethink.

The reason the LDS church is so great is because its leaders actually speak for god. Now if you want a prophet who speaks for god, you need to find another church."

I'm thankful that at a young age a close friend of my mom's told me I didn't need makeup. I make a point to tell all the women in my life the same.

"Ah so my point was more for when you're not ""on assignment"". I totally agree with your reasoning, and if I had ever brought only my phone to any event I shot, I think my client would have fired me on the spot.

For example if I'm out skiing and we're on a chair lift up, I may be carrying my rebel in my day bag but my phone is the obvious choice for snapping a quick shot of the family. Yes I could be more prepared and have it ready, but there are some situations when I don't have the time and a phone is the better choice.


Also another point I want to throw in here is when your ""client"" is a friend or family member. My father has been rockin the same desktop wallpaper for about 3 years or so of a blowen up cellphone camera image.

"I can tell you put a lot of effort into it, but I do not find your argument compelling. I will try to put just as much effort into my post as you have in yours. I have tried to be polite and keep my emotions out of it, but some of your comments rubbed me the wrong way so I apologize if some of my frustration seeped through and manifested itself as rudeness. I am not trying to flame you. Here's the issues I have with your post:

>People get uptight with her tendency to screw with her friends and be lazy / cocky, but that is similar to how I act around my closest friends. I am a pretty nice guy and would help my friends with almost anything they ask, but that doesnt mean I cant have a little fun at their expense once in a while.

Do you crash into your friends, knocking them into the mud and probably causing them from physical pain, and then just laugh and NOT EVEN APOLOGIZE like RD does in episode one? Didn't think so. There is a difference between having fun at someone's expense (Pinkie does this all the time and no one hates her for it) and being an inconsiderate asshole. And no, it's not ""uptight"" to not want your friend to physically injure you, get your coat all dirty, and then laugh about it and say ""no need to thank me"" like she did you a favor. In what way is this ""tiny"" or ""lovable"" as you call it? I would never befriend someone who treated me this way.

You say she doesn't use magic, but all ponies are magical in their own way. Pegasis flight is a magical ability, just like Earth ponies' ability to grow food is magical. Magical wing or magical horn, magic is magic. I can't see a pony going Mach 10 and magic not being a factor.

You say that she is the most awesome because she ""is able to accomplish feats that literally no one else in the entire land can accomplish."" To this I say, so what? Pinkie Pie is the only pony that can sense the future. In fact, she's faster than RD. Twilight Sparkle is the only pony who could soothe Ursa Minor. Fluttershy is the only pony who has control over butterflies. When it comes to mane 6 ponies, there is nothing about being able to accomplish unique feats that separates her from the rest of the pack.

You say that Celestia might have had a different apprentice, but Celestia values leadership qualities more than magical talent. I think you misunderstand the reasons for her choice of student. Rainbow Dash would NOT make a good leader. For sake of convenience, I will take an example from the most recent episode. In Power Ponies, while Twilight tries to help Spike with his insecurities by saying ""well at least you aren't Humdrum"" Rainbow Dash says something like ""just stand back and leave it to us,"" NOTICEABLY hurting Spike's feelings. This kind of unhelpful attitude is always causing turbulence within the group, and she would make a bad princess because of these traits regardless of her magical talent. Furthermore, you overestimate RD's focus. Even with immense magical talent, RD is too bored by the idea of studying spells to nurture magical talent, whereas Twilight is the opposite way.

You say that Rarity seems to have a bigger ego than RD. I think this is very biased. Again, using just the last episode as an example, we can find a scene in which Rainbow Dash is bragging, whereas there is no scene of Rarity bragging. This is not an exception; it is the trend. No one cares if her brags are true. They care that she brags.

>If she is only saying uplifting things about herself and not putting others down, I can't comprehend how others can see this as a way she is being rude / disrespectful.

I can't comprehend how you don't see her as rude The entire episode Dragonshy is basically her complaining about Fluttershy, with rude/disrespectful lines such as ""not YOUR fault [angry scowl at Fluttershy]"" and saying ""Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?"" with an obvious angry and sarcastic tone. In Princess Twilight Sparkle, when AJ fails to pull the vines off the Tree of Harmony, I am pretty sure RD is being rude and sarcastic when she says ""nice try,"" because she sounds like she has a tone there too and the facial language makes it look like she is making fun of AJ. I know there is a much better example, because I SPECIFICALLY remember a scene where Twi is trying to give pep-talk and RD says something counterproductive and hurtful to another pony's feelings and Twi yells ""RAINBOW DASH!,"" but I can't remember the episode right now. I'll edit my post if I remember. I deliberately didn't use MMDW as an example, but there are probably examples in there too.

You say that ""it's all true"" and ""On top of that, pretty much everything she says is the truth. Its not like she cant do the things she boasts about."" How can you think this? It's simply not true. Again, using only the most recent episodes, in Daring Do she brags that she is ""the series' biggest fan,"" and it is obvious from the scene that Twilight is a bigger fan than her. RD brags about nearly everything because she thinks she is the best at almost everything. It seems like you might have selective memory and avoid remembering the ways Rainbow Dash is arrogant, as this is a very clear-cut and dry example that the writers have spoon-fed us to show how RD is unjustified in her arrogance. If a professional gamer says he is the best soccer player in the world, and he clearly isn't, I will not think he is awesome. Rainbow Dash is no different for thinking she is the biggest fan of a series when she isn't even up to date on the release of the next book in the series.

>Another one of things that drives me crazy about most of the reasons people dislike rainbow is the fact that almost every thing is exclusive to the rainbow of the first season / beginning of second season.

I believe I have already completely disproved this statement with concrete examples.

If you have a rebuttal to any of my arguments, please make them. I am always curious why anybody likes RD. If you found flaws in some of my arguments it would make me very happy to be able to understand your perspective, because it completely baffles me.

I apologize if any of my words were unkind."

"A few years ago, a good male friend of mine told me over fb chat (while he was drunk) that he was still a virgin (he was about 25 at the time). And that was the end of our friendship.

To clarify: in the process of his confession, I kept assuring him that there was nothing wrong with being a virgin and that he didn't have to be ashamed, that he should't be ashamed. I said all the caring, supportive things a friend would say, and I legitimately meant it. I loved that guy, he was one of my favorite people in the world, and I didn't think any differently of him.

"Thanks for taking the time to respond. I think the difference we are having is that I see “toxic masculinity” as a cultural idea of how a man should be and you’re seeing it as a statement to define all male behavior. For the record I do not think this is an issue for all men or that being masculine is problematic on its own. 

My understanding of damaging and unhealthy means that it would affect their well being and their quality of life. It affects how they navigate the relationships with people around them and the expectations they put on themselves and others. When you grow up in a world that has unhealthy expectations of what it means to me a man or woman you will be likely to develop not so great behaviors to try and accommodate those expectations. Everybody experiences it differently. There is no way to say “all men do this” or “all women do this”. 

I agree that obesity should be treated as a serious illness and not celebrated. At the same time a person who is obese should still be able to celebrate other parts of themselves e.g personality, intelligence, humor, style, etc. But in terms of how it applies to toxic masculinity/ “the toxic idea of what it is to be a man” is that they don’t feel comfortable being open about it and just suppress a bunch of negative emotions. I’m not saying they need to be a gushing weepy willow about it but any negative emotion needs some kind of healthy outlet. Especially when it comes to self confidence. If you just let the idea of “I’m gross and nobody will love me” fester inside yourself it will not only hurt your mental well being but also taint how you approach relationships with others. 

Male friendship definitely takes a different form than female friendship. I can respect and appreciate that. What I attribute to toxic masculinity/the toxic idea of what it is to be a man is the rising male suicide rate and men being less likely to seek out professional help to work through those issues. You are now starting to see prominent male figures being more open and honest about their struggles with depression and mental illness and encouraging others to seek help as well. I do agree that women are much more likely to be open about their emotions but we are more encouraged to do so as we grow up. I wouldn’t say I cry/act unreliable/ switch moods every second nor do most women (but I’ve met plenty who do, just not the majority). But we just might have to agree to disagree on that point. As to whether or not that is toxic femininity I would say kinda? As unhelpful as that is. Toxic femininity is a whole more 10 paragraphs of text lol. 

The reason toxic masculinity/”the toxic idea of what it is to be a man” applies to parenthood is because it hurts the men involved. It’s not about the behavior of the men involved. It’s about the cultural perception of what it is to be a man that negatively affects them. People do not expect to see a father take an active role in their child’s life so when a man does he gets pushback. 

I would also prefer that it not have to be divided up by gender but it's the reality of the world we live in. Men and women are different. They deal with different issues. It’s important we be able to use the language to identify individual problems with both experiences. Fixing this doesn’t fall solely on the shoulders of men. We all need to be involved in changing our societal expectations for both men and women. 

And with that I hit the hay cause its late as fuuuuuuck. Thanks for taking the time to debate gender politics with me. Its always nice have a civil conversation about these things.

"To me, the fleshed-out character with a pre-formed personality creates the deepest immersion. When NPCs already have some kind of relationship with the PC, it creates a depth to the story that is hard to replicate in a completely custom PC.

In games like Skyrim, I always felt that while the story options available to me were interesting, I never really felt compelled to do them. I would finish a quest, and the most I would have to show for it was some new item or title. I was the Dragonborn, played an integral part in the civil war of Skyrim, leader of the companions, a werewolf, archmage of the magic college, leader of the thieves guild, and member of the dark brotherhood, but any NPC that wasn't directly tied to each of those quest lines treated me the same as when I had arrived in Skyrim. 

In contrast, when Geralt and Vesemir walk into a bar and are looked at with disdain because of their hair, eyes, and medallion, I love that. When Commander Shepard banters with Joker in the cockpit because they've worked together before, I love that too. Even in a more action heavy game like the Last of Us, when Bill owes Joel a favor for something that happened in the past, it creates a more interesting story for me than if I had complete control over what the character says and does. 

That's not to say I dislike all ""empty"" characters. If a game has an empty character but a very strong supporting cast, like in KOTOR or Divinity Original Sin 2, the story is immersive because of the relationships you build. But 9/10, I would rather have a fully voiced character with a history over a character that is supposed to be ""me."" "

Corporations have been know screw people in the past where they had to pass a law for you to see what they are collecting. But this only applies to your Credit not to anything else they are collecting. 

So why the fuck is it when the corporations do its fine, but when the government does its the biggest fucking overreach ever. Hell let the NSA outsource the work to a corporation, I wonder how many people will still complain?

The scene that comes to mind is at the beginning of the episode when he was asking the pharmacist about where he might find a place to stay, he kept being kind of rude and sarcastic. If he really wanted to go unnoticed, I feel like he would behave a little more kindly toward people. Just kind of an odd character choice. "
"> And now you're confusing implementing code with solving problems. Ruby provides solutions to some problems. Some of those solutions are implemented using recursion. That doesn't mean Ruby ""does recursion for you"".

Was my phrasing too sloppy for you to understand my point? Fine, I'll try again:

I let Ruby handle things for me that could be solved by recursion, because they've already been done.

Does that help you get my exceedingly simple point, or are you still going to pretend I'm trying to make a point I'm not, just to feed your feelings of superiority with pedantry?

> Recursion is a necessary skill because you need to be able to think recursively to solve problems, well before you start writing code. Whether or not that solution is implemented recursively is a minor concern.

Did anyone ever suggest otherwise?

> As a programmer, our job is to get really big problems, often ones so big they can't find in our little brains, and break them down into smaller parts that when combined somehow solve the whole problem. That's really hard. One of the most powerful, if not the most powerful ways to do that is knowing how to break down a problem in terms of itself. That's recursion. Writing a fib() function is irrelevant. It's all about knowing how to say ""can I redefine this big problem using a tiny one that references itself?""

No shit, Sherlock. In that sense, I use recursion all the time. What I don't do all the time is write recursive functions. Please try to stick to the actual topic.

"Geordi displays creepy entitlement a lot, and two big examples that come to mind are bith the Brahms episode(s) you mentioned as well as ""Aquiel"" (se06ep13) in which he literally falls in love w a woman he's supposed to be investigating for murder and is so taken by the impression of her he gets in his head by reviewing her logs that it fucks w his ability to objectively investigate. 

Equally creepy and entitled is the whole situation w the Brahms holo, which OF COURSE he ""gets along well w"" bc he literally programs her to be a good match for him. When the real Brahms discovers this creepy program, she rightfully confronts him about it (why does it even still exist in the database? So Geordi can have nerdy engineering dates w her). That whole thing ""resolves"" bc she is gracious enough to just forgive him, partially bc she's impressed by his brilliance (?) Like, he even has the audacity to be MAD at her (a married woman) for not being anything like what he expects or wants.

I LOVE Geordi, TNG, and Lavar Burton, but the writing around his character and woman was notoriously sketchy and weird.

"You're a complete asshole with some weird negative fixation on ONE medication.

So if your spouse is depressed and as a result, checks out of the marriage and stops being a partner, but finally seeks therapy and that helps save your crumbling marriage, does that mean the marriage is bad because it couldn't be managed without outside help?

If I can only do my job while wearing my glasses to read the computer screen, does that mean it's the wrong job for me and I should find one where I don't have to use my glasses?

Someone with ADHD can be hard to live with. They forget things. They lose things. The don't pay their bills. They don't pick up after themselves and they leave messes everywhere. They could be perfect in every other way, but that shit wears on a marriage and even if you love someone very much and are compatible in all other ways, it can be exhausting. Stimulants don't change a person's personality, they merely allow that person the clarity and motivation to do the things normal people don't struggle with.

"That's the cruel, fundamental logic of capitalism, pal. Consider GM: through aggressive layoffs and tough negotiations with the UAW, they've managed to return to profitability. This comes at the cost of worker benefits, but the alternative is for the workers to have no jobs at all.

You can complain about executive pay, but you have to realize that such compensation is set according to the same market logic that controls the pay of the lowest line worker. Generally speaking, when someone is being paid $5M a year to do a job, it's because the economic value of their services is $5M a year. Such captains of industry are very scarce, and they charge accordingly for their services.

Raise compensation for anyone above the levels dictated above the market, and you compromise your competitiveness, since someone will (this is almost guaranteed) undercut you on costs and outperform you on profit, for which you are responsible to your shareholders.

edit I don't want to seem too mercenary here: it's not like the very wealthy do not owe anything to the American people. On the contrary, the American people and American government provide the stability, workforce, and market that enable their success. In return, I do not think it unreasonable to tax them accordingly -- but don't force them to shoot themselves in the foot by compromising their companies' competitiveness.

"> blatant media bias in favor of clinton

So I guess that explains why the coverage of the clinton foundation dwarfed coverage of the trump foundation? I guess it also explains why the media treated the email scandal as just as bad as Trump's various scandals? 

>Just my two cents, as a trump voter, a big reason it was hard for me to come around for Hillary was because the media bias was so clearly in her favor. 

Personally, I felt the opposite. It was hard for me to see how people like yourself could come around to Hillary because even the ""left wing"" media outlets still covered Hillary's scandals almost non-stop. Sure, you could argue that they covered a lot of Trump's scandals, but they really did not have much positive coverage of Hillary. 

> It has a way of making you resent le epic liberal celebrities like John Oliver and Colbert and makes it impossible to take anything they say seriously.

Well, Oliver and Colbert I can see where you're coming from... but when I watched CNN, when I watched MSNBC, even when I read the NYtimes, there was a LOT of coverage of clinton's scandals, to the point that I sometimes was amazed they still had things to cover on those topics since it had been so exhaustively covered, already. 

>I think Hillary could have done a lot better if the media had played it fairly, i dont think the answer is to encourage more bias


This I suppose is also fair... but really, my gripe isn't necessarily that SNL should become bias... it's more that this cold open showed that their bias is clearly in favor of the democrats, they just sort of, didn't wanna act on it before the election, for fear of being accused of bias. "

"It mostly depends on the difficulty level you are playing at.

Basic tips: For rogues, dexterity and cunning each contribute to the amount of damage done by piercing weapons (daggers and bows, but not xbows). Cunning contributes more to damage, but nothing else. Dexterity contributes to damage, and also defense. I always specced dagger rogues 18 cunning, 16 constitution and everything else to dexterity. Doing this will ensure that your rogues never get hit by melee (until you get to golems of ammalammadingdong). Rogues should use daggers. Swords are strength-based, and you will miss all the time, or just have weak damage, or spec all str....and not be able to dodge anything.

Mages are for haste. You can have them cast offensive or heal spells as well, but you need to set tactics up carefully, or they will run out of mana and cancel haste....which is bad. They should also run a weapon augment spell like fire weapons or telekinetic weapons.

I suggest you set mages up to run haste, and telekenetic weapons, and then cast 1-2 spells with cooldowns. Crushing prison is a great one, as well as cold snap. then jsut have them staff attack to avoid their dropping weapon augs and haste.

In the base game, rogues cannot benefit from double haste, but warriors can. If you run two mages, you will want your powerhouse damage machine to be a warrior who dual wields swords or axes. you will want to run precision, because that will slow down normal attach speed, and allow for 2x haste (100% attack speed) to equate to a number between 1 and 2. The issue is that the game sees 200% as equal to 100%.

Archery is awesome once you get (dammit I forget) Arrow of slaying (I think). Archer is the only means I am aware of in which the game can be completed nightmare-solo.

""Attack"" means ""target and follow tactics.""

If you have a mage setup like this:

1. Targets nearest hostile mage: attack
2. cast crushing prison: nearest hostile mage.

You don't seem to acknowledge that women face an issue related to sexism and they have a term for calling it out. Do you not like that they made a term about misogynistic behavior? Or are you saying they don't face this issue? Of course men sometimes face the same problem but that is usually due to agism/racism/elitism. It just seems hard for you to realize that women also face sexism in this manner. "

"Hmm probably a little controversial to say, but is it really that different from fetishising any other (non-""race"" based) group? For example bear, twinks, jocks, femms, mascs, chubs, gingers etc.
The way i see it, it's just the same dating mentality (not restricted to the LGBT community) which just happens to involve a recognised group of people from a specific ethnic background. Whether exclusively ""preferring"" someone/people for a specific physical trade is right or wrong, is open to debate and i fear there is no universal answer without being completely close minded or cherry picking logic. 
We all do it to some degree - “race” just happens to be a hot button topic for a lot of people (who ironically tend to be more race obsessed than others ).

My only suggestion would be to ignore guys who completely fetishise you, or judge you (positively or negatively) for a small part of who you are (race-based or not). There’s plenty of other guys out there who will see you as a whole person and want to get to know you in various ways. 

(Bit of a rant from this point on)

I've gotten into various discussions with people in the past over the topic of ""preference"" vs ""racism"" in the dating world (again, not just in the LGBT community), and although we were never able to see eye to eye on the subject, i did overall find that most people i talked to weren't racist or discriminatory by nature; even though they had a race-based sexual preference - they still had ethnic friends, coworkers, family member etc, who they loved and got along with perfectly fine.

To me, intent is probably the most important thing to keep in mind. Are these individuals that have specific views, opinions and preferences towards others of a specific racial group, doing it with a negative/destructive purpose? Or are they admirers and lovers of people within that group? This pretty much leads towards the complex topic of ""positive & negative” racism, which applies to many aspects of society. IMHO, the negative end should definitely be frowned upon and discouraged (i.e. ""all black people are criminals"", ""all asians have small penises"", ""all jews are greedy"" etc). There's much debate on whether positive racism is right or wrong, as ultimately some groups benefits, while others are excluded because of their race.

Either way, to me it seems that having a physical ""preference"" (racial-based or not) will require exclusion of others based on physical attributes which they can’t change. So in the end someone will always feel hurt and left out for being who they are, even though people weren't trying to be racist or hurtful toward them."

> No it's not, part of it is similar to her base skin's idle pose, but it has extra sections to it, and it being reminiscent of her base skin is not a bad thing regardless given how different the model is. You still want it to be recognizable as MF and that's a great way to connect the two.

Its litreally her base skin iidle pose but with robotic hands, the extra sections are there because she literally has robotic hands that are guns and no guns.

> No you couldn't. In fact from past ultimate/legendary skins you could say without a doubt that all of her animations will be new or different. It's not immediately bad just because the body pose is somewhat similar to something from another skin. There's only so much you can do to make the pose different without her starting to look ridiculous.
look at the body pose and just wonder what else will she do with autoattacks, its the 1/2/1/2 gun play again, nothing new, iif anything there will be new vfx but the animation as of now looks liike its going to be the same.

> Like I said above I think this is an incredibly unhealthy way to look at ultimate skins. You can't expect literally every single ultimate skin after Lux to have 10+ forms or else it's ""bad no matter what"", that's just honestly preposterous. 

And like i said this is a recycled idea that has less quantity than the first one so unless the quality is god tier (which is u nlikely when you consider lux quality with effects aws pretty good already) this is just bad right from the beginning, even the models are worse than lux, at least she was a bit different but in this one its just a recolor apart from the guns. its not bad because it doesnt have 10 forms, its bad because its a recycled idea with less forms, less models (just chromas wiith different guns) not because it doesnt have different forms, if this doesnt briing in anything new over the two latest skins then its just bad and i hope you will agree with this because from the price it looks like riot already acknowledged this which is bad consiidering they could've done a better work and kept the price."

Saudi is an Islamic country, and while they offer mercy (see Raif Badawi; he should have been sentenced to beheading [which he might be wishing for now] but was given a merciful sentence of 1000 lashes and 10 years of jail for criticizing Islam) they still seem to uphold the five pillars pretty religiously (pun intended).

I can't speak for him so I don't know how he'd feel but if I were him I'd be legit hurt.

There's people taking stances against game journalism in general, and then there's attacking an individual. I personally feel that your hatred (however just) for the state of game journalism has resulted in an unnecessarily severe attack on Mitch.

It would be kind of shocking to come across one who didn't, which is what I imagine is behind Donovan's reply to Bocanegra. (I also got out that Donovan is really going above and beyond the call of duty to shill for Wells Fargo. Guy is bucking for some new endorsements.) 

Maybe it's different if you've played for the US and personally gone to war with El Tri, but still, it just seems kind of unthinkable (based on real-world experience) that any American soccer fan with some kind of ethnic identity wouldn't be supporting their country of ethnic origin in some form, especially in this WC with the US absent.

">Of course not. But I don't know exact numbers/percentages on how many liberals are saying the things they are, so the assumption here is that I'm speaking about the ones who act in such a way.

That is the assumption you are going into the conversation with, and if someone is approaching with a spirit of generous discourse they will certainly grant you that, but why bother relying on others to make that concession? If you know that you are presenting a hyperbolic extreme view that you don't actually believe, why are you presenting it that way? Is there anything to disagree about if one says ""Some left leaning folk can't calmly and reasonably discuss race""? The only thing that can be brought up in opposition is ""Right leaning folk are the same"" which is obvious and true. Thus the only real view on the subject that passes muster is ""Race, gender, and sex are complex subjects that many people won't discuss calmly and reasonably"". Why are you employing the exact same tactics and faulty rhetoric as the people you are disparaging for using those same tactics and rhetoric?

>Various places, including reddit, facebook, twitter, real life, etc. While I understand the point about how the most opinionated people are usually the loudest,

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The most opinionated are not the loudest. The people who are least willing to engage in honest, open, generous discourse are the loudest. The people who are the least likely to actually listen are the loudest. The people who are most likely to desperately seek attention and the smug satisfaction of feeling superior (but are only capable of feeling that in direct opposition to people they imagine are their ideological enemies) are the loudest. They are not opinionated, they are combative. To people like this issue does not matter nearly as much as the fight. 

>When I see a tweet that says ""you're a racist asshole"" to Trump and it gets 10,000 retweets and 15,000 favorites, it's hard to feel like that group is only a tiny tiny fraction of liberals.

One question to ask yourself is if what a person does and says online is an accurate representation of their actions and beliefs? It can be argued that their actions are closer to their ""true"" selves, that they are revealing something otherwise hidden. I find that disingenuous for a number of reasons. First I'm not sure any such thing as a ""true self"" exists. Certainly for each person there is a history of action and thought that, if added up, would accumulate to something. I don't think any of us would bother to go to the lengths of actually doing this calculation and if anyone did the results wouldn't likely obviously point to anyone definitive conclusion. Secondly, it is trivially easy to ""like"" anything without much thought or consideration. you yourself have probably liked something without first weighing all of the implications in your participation. Finally, what you are interpreting as a concrete affirmation of the fact of trumps racism is much more likely participation in an affirmation of political ideology. Does that make it ok? No, but I don't think that ""OK"" or ""not OK"" really matter? You are only capable of controlling your own reactions, not other peoples actions. You can choose to cast anyone in the worst light possible and label them a villain, or you can choose to understand why they may be doing something and push through to a place where common understanding is possible.

>Of course, 10,000 isn't a whole lot in the grand scheme of things, but considering you see things like this all around social media in various places (BuzzFeed, NowThis, Vox, NYT, etc.) with similar amounts of shares/likes/favorites/etc. it does seem like it's more widespread than we're giving credit for, considering I'm sure not all of these posts have the exact same overlap of ~15,000 people. Do I think it's all liberals? Certainly not.

This is a reflection of your social media bubble more than anything else, isn't it? Do you believe that there isn't an equivalent social media bubble on the right that shows the exact same kind of people expressing equally uncharitable views?

>Well I think the right also often throws around the ""special snowflake"" argument when afraid to have a civil discussion,

Do you honestly believe that ""special snowflake"" is the sum total, or even approaching the most objectionable thing that is displayed by dishonest, aggressive, hyperbolic people on the right? Please understand that I am not bringing this up to start a pissing contest to dicide who is ""worse"". I'm pointing this out in direct relation to your CMV which states that this is a particular problem for the left. It is not. It is present everywhere there are people.


>Yes, but I guess it depends on what someone would classify as extreme. Even if someone is openly and actively racist it doesn't come from thin air. Regardless of the extremity, there is good in understanding the opposing point. Even if it just means strengthening your argument against it. Sometimes it's tough to take the opposing side seriously when they are portraying their point in an ignorant fashion (it's hard to stay civil in a place like /pol/ for example) and that's understandable, not everyone is perfect. But if someone is putting effort in to reason their point, it's honestly a little offensive and careless that someone could just respond with ""ya but ur racist.""

You seem to be caught in the trap of treating discourse as a competition? You are treating people as opponents. Why is that? 

Obviously you shouldn't engage with people who make it clear that they aren't willing to discuss honestly. But why are you even concerning yourself with them? And why are you assigning sole responsibility for this attitude to the left? Wouldn't your time be better spent engaging with people who do wish to discuss honestly? This assuming that you have an actually interest or concern in the topic of course. 

>I think so, provided they are also willing to engage in this conversation.

Why is that a requirement? Are you incapable of synthesizing information and ideas on your own? Is it impossible to read something from a person acting in bad faith and understanding where their view originates? Do you believe that a person is not able to see that 10,000 people ""liked"" a ""trump is racist"" meme and understand that while trump might not literally want ever single black person to be subjugated or killed, trump did indeed form a large part of his political platform on toxic discourse and racial resentment?

Why are you blaming your own chosen reactions on the actions of others?"
"Alright, fine, I'll insert the Greek.


Revelation 22:8-9 (New World Translation)
I [John] fell down to proskyneō before the feet of the angel that had been showing me these things. 9 But he tells me: “Be careful! Do not do that! All I am is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who are prophets and of those who are observing the words of this scroll. proskyneō God.”

Revelation 5:13-14 (New World Translation)
13 And every creature that is in heaven and on earth and underneath the earth and on the sea, and all the things in them, I heard saying: “To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.” 14 And the four living creatures went saying: “Amen!” and the elders fell down and proskyneō.


It's the exact same word every time. Look at Revelation 7 (New World Translation)

>And all the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell upon their faces before the throne and proskyneō God, 12 saying: “Amen! The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength [be] to our God forever and ever. Amen.”


Whatever they're doing, it should only be done to God (22:9), it is done to God (7:11), and it is done to God and Jesus simultaneously (5:14). There is no getting around it. 5:14 is not simple honor any more than 7:11 is, it's worship, and the Father shares his worship with Jesus.


The same is true of Revelation 22:13. The Alpha and Omega who is speaking is the one who is coming quickly in verse 12, and that is Jesus. It's not difficult to conclude, it's easy.


And what's with all the condescension? 

>my conclusion is that the scriptures mean what they mean

Your conclusions, everyone's conclusions, are influenced by their theology and assumptions. No one comes with a blank slate to Scripture, it's impossible. We are cultural creatures, creatures of context. Otherwise we would all understand the same way and lock pinkies and sing kumbaya. That's just not how it works.


What about these?

>Again, my point with bringing up the creation texts is the way creation is described. It is ""from"" God and ""through"" Jesus, and in Isaiah 48:13 Jehovah calls the creative agent his own right hand. I realize that in English parlance, we call people ""my righthand man,"" but that's clearly not what Jehovah has in mind. He's communicating his intimacy with his creation saying that he personally with his own hands laid the foundations. So it seems that Jehovah considers Jesus his very own hands. Do your hands share a nature with you?
>
>
>We can agree that Jesus was not just a prophet. Prophets spoke words of God at certain times, but their every word was not God's word. Jesus is different, he claims that every single word out of his mouth is God's word, how can that be if they don't share a nature? If Jesus's every word was just a mouthpiece from Jehovah, and everything he did was dictated by Jehovah, then Jesus was a puppet and has no personality at all! Yet we affirm that Jesus has personality, so when he says ""I do not speak of my own originality"" he must mean a cooperative effort between himself and Jehovah. And if that's the case, how can his every word and action be God's word and action AND Jesus's word and action unless they share a nature?"

"

My understanding is a lot more common than you might think. In fact, if you realize this, you might even find.. who knows.. Some people who didn't make much sense to you before might make a little bit more sense.

But that said, there are plenty of theists out there who do not understand what it is I am saying, especially among Christians. 

The best way to lead religious people into better understanding and more beneficial behavior is to actually educate them on their religion. The best way you can lead the religious into a more accurate and beneficial understanding is to approach them as a brother rather than an antagonist. If you are speaking to a Christian, speak as a Christian. The atheist position is threatening and can only be antagonistic to a Christian. Effective communication is difficult this way. 

The message of Christianity, at it's core, is actually very beneficial, and when understood actually frees people from the shackles of religious dogma. I understand that this statement of truth is going to sound patently ridiculous to anyone who only has a surface level understanding of the Gospel of Jesus. The church, after all, seems to testify so much to the contrary.

I think that most people are concerned with the things that effect society. I am to, and this is why I talk with people of all walks of life.

A lot of religious folk don't understand that religion can not be forced on people. It isn't helpful. There is no virtue without temptation, as it is said. There are many who involve themselves too much in politics when it is clear in every religion that it is better to take personal accountability for ones own actions rather than the actions of others.

Most people are not educated very well in their religions, and this is part of what leads to corruption.

I feel it is my moral duty to educate people about my understanding of God when I can, yes. I think that my understanding leads to better mental health and a more peaceful coexistence. 

That said, I am not one to preach. I will go into detail with people who are interested, but for the most part my teaching methods are more indirect. It is very hard for most people to grasp my understanding of God, and speaking to large groups would only compound this.

The celebrated cooger has come near entirely from female media. Meanwhile an older man with a twenty year old is a pariah in society. 

>Abortion rights, 


If women had no abortion rights they would be equal with men.

>Birth Control rights, 

Women have more birth control rights and options.

>pay gap, 

This is a myth. Married women spend less time at the work place. The men they are married to share their wages with them. Men take less out of the tax system than they put in. Its the opposite for women, so large sums of money are transferred to women from men via the state and relationships. So women have more access to resources.

The lesbian premium research shows women are paid more when they work as much as men. 


>political representation, 

Women are the majority of voters so they have more political representation. They get a much easier ride when they run for office. Fact is the majority of women want to start being mothers at around 35. This is why there are gaps in the professional world.


>media representation,

Women control 80% consumer spending so the media is slanted towords women.

>FGM, 

Men are more affected. 2 million women verses 1/3 of the male population have this done to them. Its done to men in america for profit. Feminist organizations go to help girls in africa and leave their brothers to die of the same infections.


>rape culture,

This affects men more. Rape of men is barely spoken about the numbers arent widely collected or reported. Society excuses womens rapes, not the other way around.

> cross gender violence,

Women are more aggressive in this regard.

>lack of respect in general. 

Disrespecting a woman is blasphomy in this culture.

>Plus, it hasn't even been 100 years in the UK since women could vote. 

Men and women got the vote at around the same time. In america women get it as a birth right. Men have regrister for the draft and are punished if they dont.

>It hasn't been 50 since abortion was legalised and birth control became widespread. 

Men invented this for women, and paid for it. Society tends to object to recriprocal rights for men. 

>And it's barely been 20 since marital rape was outlawed. 

So women have more rights than men in this regard. In most countries a woman cannot be charged with rape at all.

>The women who live around you have grown up and been raised by parents and grandparents who lived through incredibly oppressive times. Societal attitudes don't change overnight.

Well it is an issue that feminists provide cover for female sex offenders. Point was I never said feminists do it in the first place.

Every time feminists talk about rape they exclude women as perpetrators.


>Really? You don't see dudes in tank tops and shorts in the club? Guys shirtless in the streets? Office I'll give you, women have the advantage of being able to wear skirts.

Generally what ever the context whats acceptable for women is more skimpy, see though and sexualized. Stripper fashion is now mainstream for example.

Nope. Equality is having full autonomy over your body, not full autonomy over all the parts and functions men have.


If a woman can commit reproductive abuse and take control over a mans labour and life under the threat of violence from the state while she has full rights to chose, he does not have full autonomy over his body and is still oppressed by traditional gender roles. Meanwhile she can have her cake and eat it too..

"> I hate to sound like a dick, but you pretty much answered your own point. Cloud is a superhuman. Also, I'm gonna advise you to go replay the game because everything in FF7 was extremely hyperbolic by nature.

You don't sound like a dick. Also I have played FF7 at least 10 times since it came out in the 90's and as recently as a few months ago. Again, I think the things you're talking about have more to do with the cartoony, limited medium the game was working with and the type of game it was. This is a different story telling medium. Yes Cloud is a superhuman. But he's still a human and there are limitations to his own abilities. Like I said earlier, Sephiroth pulling off these feats made TOTAL sense to me. He imbued with powers from an alien monster to a ridiculous degree. Again, the physics in the Tifa fight? Totally down for that. She's the greatest martial artist in their world who uses magic. I can see her managing to cling to a wall with momentum for a few seconds and jump several feat in the air. She's a beast. I also think Cloud should be able to jump MUCH higher than her and should be much stronger than her.

I don't think the physics should be 100% realistic. It's a fantasy story. I just think they should have been ""a little more grounded"". Or at LEAST more consistent. Having consistency does not cause everything to fall apart. In fact it's quite the opposite. If your story's world lacks consistency in ANY aspect, it can fall apart. Ask any professional writer. Why didn't Cloud just JUMP up to Shinra tower on disc one instead of climbing up the support structures. Why didn't he JUMP out of the Gold Saucer Prison? In fact, being able to jump THAT high, why didn't he just JUMP everywhere? On a side note, out of all the Final Fantasy games, VII is the most grounded and realistic, relatively speaking, I think. Which is one of the reasons it's so successful.

>This is a film, not a game.

Exactly. The Medium MATTERS.

> There is not enough run time to appease everyone. Rather they focus on the main character, and touch on the others briefly. They handled it well, and I'm happy.

Right, which is why you don't try to. When you do, as I mentioned earlier, that's called pandering and it takes away from the story. I wouldn't have had a problem with them touching on the characters. I personally just feel the way they did it was over the top. In honesty, I would have MUCH rather they had found a way to work those characters into the story itself much more than I would prefer they cut them. But having them show up for 2 minutes all at once just in time to stop Sephiroth was just too much for me.

> As also a fan of story structure and characters, just cause they weren't the focus, doesn't mean they should be omitted entirely, they still play important roles. An IP like FF7 would have received tremendous flack for not including those characters either way. So it was a lose-lose cause someone was bound to complain regardless of how they chose to go about it.

They all did play important roles in the game. Not in this film. In fact the only main characters who had any real relevence were Cloud, Tifa, Aerith and to an extent Vincent. I actually studied screen writing for a time earlier on in my life (I'm only saying this to note where my info comes from). One of the first rules of writing a film is: if its not pivotal to the plot or character development, cut it. I love those characters, but they were not important to that particular self-contained story. 

>Again, you're not quite grasping the nature of Final Fantasy 7 as a story

Not to sound like a dick, but just to clarify, I hold Final Fantasy VII up in my view as one of the greatest works of fiction ever created for multiple reason. I've spent hours reading analyses of the story and characters. I can tell you I 100% grasp the nature of Final Fantasy 7 as a story. 


> regardless of its medium.

Again, medium matters. 

>But you need to remember that they're not actually real and their world is far more extreme and doesn't abide by the same laws of physics as ours.

Of course. Which is why I said ""more grounded"" not completely 100% realistic in sense of its physics and science. 

Granted, I am absolutely being too picky, but that's because of how much love I have for the original story. Regardless of some of the ridiculous concepts in the game, it worked. It worked in the movie for the most part, except that one scene in particular for me. Clearly you are as passionate about this game as I am. Let's agree that the game itself kicks a ton of ass.

 everyone knows that this kind of shit there is way worse than what happens here, but we don't really have a power to cause any change in other cultures/countries/languages etc

 also note that people don't only talk about manspreading, as many people would like to believe, but a lot more about rape culture and other actually serious problems 

But to elaborate on why something so simple as manspreading actually matters :

Manspreading is about taking space. Men are taught that the public space is theirs and that they should occupy it. Actually, the more masculine you are the more space you should take. Keep your legs wide appart to show how manly you are, have a strong loud voice, etc.

So it's kind of a symbol. When some men take 3 seats for themselves and force the people next to them to have no space left, they basically act like they own the space around them and don't care about sharing it. This mindset is central to sexist oppression, because it's the root of many sexist problems. For example women feel unsafe alone in the streets because the public space belongs to men, and women just try to go around in it hoping not to get harassed by an entitled asshole.

The same men that feel entitled to three seats in the tube when there are other people are likely the same as the ones that will constantly interrupt/talk over people in meetings, or treat people like shit, or catcall women for example.

And it's called manspreading because it's an overwhelmingly male behaviour that is learned socially as part of toxic masculinity. "
"> But I see no reason for a religious organization to be 'tax exempt'.

Because a little while before the US Constitution was written Europe had gone through a series of nasty religious wars that saw a lot of people dead and the kind of no compromise, anything goes, God is on our side and we can do no wrong nastiness that religious wars seem to foster.

So Jefferson, Madison, and the rest of the boys, being quite educated and up on their (relatively recent) history decided that in the US there would be no official US religion, and the government could not hinder or interfere with anyone's religion in any way shape or form. It's in writing:

""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;""

""That the power to tax involves the power to destroy;"" - Chief Justice John Marshall

"It's two things, really. First, he has a referral network of investment advisers (ELPs) that don't necessarily subscribe to r/PF's philosophy of low-cost index investing, and some of them are actually pretty high-cost. There are lots of concerns that DR fans just coming out of a lifetime of debt will be investing for the first time, and he soaks them through kickbacks from his ELPs because they are newbs and don't know how to get started with investments but trust him blindly because he is so helpful/right wrt debt.

Second, he refers to completely unrealistic returns in his book. They are high both because of a very lucky sampling period (including the 90s bull market but neither of the subsequent bear markets) as well as bad math (he doesn't do ""average"" returns the way most people think you should). In some ways, getting people excited about high returns is helpful if they need to get out of debt. But you can't plan on 10% returns, so as soon as you are actually out of debt you should read The Millionaire Next Door, A Random Walk Down Wall-Street, anything by Jack Bogle, and pretty much all the others on the r/PF reading list.

Fair enough. I was just talking off the top of my head. To expand on the prof's point, archaeologists tend to assume that anything big and monumental was built by a state. This can become quite tautological.

Another separate point is that big, monumental forms of infrastructure might actually be a stupid idea in the first place. They could be liabilities that inherently involve the kinds of corrosive power relations that lead to civilizational collapse. Maybe the whole discipline of archaeology is focused on the dumb cultures: the ones that didn't heed the advice to ""leave no trace.""

Anyway, if you want to talk ""trends,"" I'll simply point out that, due to IMF/World Bank ""Structural Adjustment"" the state is in retreat anyway and yet infrastructure is still getting built. In the first world, this is often done through private companies (Graham and Marvin's Splintering Urbanism covers this well). In many other parts of the world, this is increasingly falling on kin networks and other forms of non-state mutual aid.

"Fast and Furious gets away with it with audiences for several reasons:

Well directed action: While some of the action in FF7 I found a bit hard to follow at times, the series has maintained large scale action on a cohesive level. Despite how ludicrous stuff gets, space and movement in the action is always well defined. Compare it to a scene from Transformers 2, where there could be some great action going on, but is nearly incomprehensible due to how it's filmed and edited. Fast and Furious 3, 5 and 6 especially really upped their game in both stakes and relativity in how stunts are choreographed and action is displayed. It's fun that can be followed.

Characters: People like them. It's funny when you give a character even the slightest amount of discernible personality in a long running series like this, people will become attached. There's chemistry between the cast, you get the sense that the actors enjoy themselves and like being around each other. Heck, half the reason I go see these movies is to see Roman crack wise. Audiences actually give a shit about what happens to them, even if at this stage they are invincible.

Audiences are in on the joke: I think this is the biggest difference between Bay's films and Fast and Furious. They are both ridiculous, unsubtle, loud and obnoxious, but the Fast and Furious franchise have evolved to a level of slight self-awareness that sets itself up to be laughed at how stupid it is. With Bay's films, while immature, are usually serious in tone and style. Fast and Furious wants you to think it's dumb, Bay wants you to know you are dumb for watching this."

"> ""If my mother's pills, which she needs to survive, were being held by a man who said that if I didn't rob a bank he would let my mother die, is my robbing of the bank voluntary? If it is, why is an action being voluntary inherently desirable?""

The fact that you have to resort to an absolutely ridiculous hypothetical to refute the philosophy attests to the strength of the philosophy. I can just as easily turn around and list real examples of the state screwing up people's lives, and in many cases killing people: using eminent domain to take property away with little recompense, raiding someone's house for dealing drugs and killing them in the process (sometimes people who have no connection to the drug trade either), killing millions in frivolous wars, etc. The atrocities committed by private individuals are minuscule compared to the atrocities committed by the state. You can say that this is not exclusively an argument for ancapism, but rather anarchism as a whole, but the point still stands that ancaps can and do make these arguments.

> it's unrealistic to expect any unregulated armed force that can achieve superiority over another force to perpetually resist subjugation of others.

The market system prevents one armed force from becoming superior to all other armed forces combined. Even if you disagree with this premise, the conclusions ancaps draw from this premise can still be valid conclusions if the premise is assumed true. I think that the communist premise that workers are exploited is complete and utter nonsense, but that doesn't necessarily make communists' arguments derived from that premise are invalid logical reasoning. More often than not, the majority of an argument is logically consistent, and it is either the premise or one crucial step in the logical chain that brings down otherwise correct arguments.

> Yet, people are not rational and there are many cases throughout history of small conflicts escalating, changing the world order (WWI).

> When asked about what happens to the property of the poor of their society, they respond by describing gang violence.

One commentor replied:

> In AnCap society, I would expect tort claims to be transferable. Poor people could get justice if they were wronged by selling their tort claims to capable prosecutors. The poor person might get compensated fairly quickly for an injustice done to them and the prosecutor would have an incentive to get as much restitution as he could, thus punishing the perpetrator. So there might be more of a deterrent to preying on the poor, and the poor would be more likely to collect restitution, in an AnCap society than in today's society.

I see nothing wrong with this argument. It seems like a plausible scenario.

> When asked about how the environment will be saved, they simply say that people will refuse to buy property from polluters

Not all ancaps believe this. I believe that pollution is aggression and a direct violation of property rights in many cases, so the problem should be solved using the court system.

> When asked about how schooling will be done, ancaps forget that for the impoverished, there is no major incentive for children to go to school.

Parents want their children to have better lives, and most would send their kids to school if they could.

> There are many illegal Mexican immigrant children working on strawberry fields, even though school is free.

The reason illegal immigrants can't go to school is because there are no cheap private alternatives available to them. In the thread you linked the user with the top comment explained that cheap private schools cannot stay in business because they have to compete with free public schools. This seems like a reasonable argument to me.

> The vast majority of ancap arguments come from a position of idealism. 

And communists don't? The class struggle, the ""exploitation"" of the working class, and the ""inevitable"" failure of capitalism and rising up of the proletariat all seem pretty ideologically driven to me. 

> Ignoring their economics

You just ignored a large portion of ancaps - the consequentialists.

Their arguments aren't too terribly different, which gives me the sense that you just have implicit bias against ancaps."

The latter do exist; many white progressives do not think they have it all figured out. It reminds me of people who think that a violent or hateful person who was ""born again"" in evangelical/charismatic Christianity are better than people who've had no trouble not being violent and trying not to be hateful all along without a newfound religion to tell them those things are wrong.

"> You don't need a list, that's just you making things up. If you don't like the pokémon canon then that's your problem.

And your problem appears to be that you don't understand what a canon actually is.

I'm not saying that there aren't canonical Pokémon games. But what the OP was asking was if both SM and USUM are considered canonical. They both are, but that's by default, because Game Freak and TPC haven't really released any kind of visible canon for the series that we can reference. ""The Pokémon canon"" isn't something that the creators seem interested in micromanaging like, say, Lucasfilm did with the Star Wars canon. Game Freak simply release the games and let them stand on their own merits as a part of the ongoing series. So the OP's question is, understandably, slightly misaimed, because GF/TPC have never been in the business of declaring games to be non-canonical anyway.

> You're the one that failed to read that sentence.

I said that the ""world without Mega Evolution"" to which ORAS were referring was likely the world of RSE.

You then said ""This means ruby, sapphire and emerald.""

If I misunderstood that, then it's probably because you didn't really communicate anything coherent with that sentence. All it looks like is a needless repetition of what I already stated.

> You said zinnia saying rse being a different world from oras means that all games before gen 6 are from a different world from oras. The only way this makes sense is that if rse were the only games before gen 6 which, aside from it not being the case, you even acknowledge. You're contradicting yourself.

Nope. Re-read what I said. I said that ORAS establish the existence of a world without Mega Evolution. Which is likely referring to RSE.

But here's where the concept of implication seems lost on you. None of the other games before Gen VI had Mega Evolution either, and those games were all very much in continuity with RSE. So by associative property, they would also take place in the world without Mega Evolution.

> Said where?

Any time the games with Mega Evolution have referenced events that we know went down in the other regions. An NPC in XY talking about Team Plasma making the news, Colress referring to his previous experience with Pokémon fusion. The Malie Garden bridge imitators saying that Giovanni and Team Rocket were defeated years ago. Blue saying that both he and Red became Champions. Looker mentioning his prior encounters with Team Galactic and Team Plasma. A reference to Zapdos once inhabiting the Kanto Power Plant. And so on. Point is, the fact that these details, which happened in the games before the whole Megaverse stuff came in, are being mentioned in the games after the Megaverse stuff came in, means that the Megaverse still experienced those events in a similar way.

For example, the laws HSUS push lead to increased animal welfare and increased awareness about animal cruelty. Both good things.

At the end of the day we are not going to get everyone in the world to turn vegan at once. I sincerely wish that could happen, but most people need stepping stones.

>A star that was 7 light years away now appears to be only one light year away, and sure enough, it takes one year of ship time to reach it.

> the two observers don't agree on the measurement of either time or distance travelled.

I'm not being obstinate - you just haven't yet convinced me that's how it works - can you cite a source please?

Here's another question. Let's take a star that's 7 parsecs away from Earth. WISE 0855–0714 will do - it's 7.2 but we'll round down for the sake of discussion. By your reasoning that would mean that if I could travel there at 0.99 lightspeed, then I would feel it to take a year and my sensors would indicate that only a year had passed since I left.

But in point of fact, (assuming stationary stars for simplicity's sake) I am traveling the entire distance from Earth to the the Star, am I not?

So, the time dilation effects the man traveling at high velocity and he is actually traveling 7 light years but perceives it as one year? My question is - given that the distance doesn't change, what happens to the distance in the equation? Is the fabric of the Universe contracted so 7 lightyears gets contracted into 1?

Or are you saying that the man will not hit the brakes until 7 years of Earth time is up - as time in his local reference point is happening much more slowly? (That would actually make sense.) But if he's traveling to WISE 0855-0714, he'll still need to cover that distance and he will travel for 7 years at 0.99 and go 7 parsecs and the star's position is still 7 years from Earth. So, then will he need fuel for the 7 parsecs or only one?"

">But I still haven't heard any feminists acknowledge the empathy gap exists, which to me is just as closed minded as the MRM is towards feminism because the discussion can't really even get off the ground if feminists aren't willing to admit that point.

But when it's presented as feminists are the cause for the empathy gap it's a different statement altogether than just asking for acknowledgement that one exists. This is what I was initially talking about with regards to being anti something instead of just critical of it. When you're against something as broad as feminism (and to a lesser extent the MRM) everything is looked at in how something is wrong relative to that movement. 

So let's assume for arguments sake that feminists don't acknowledge an empathy gap. We should now ask ourselves why it's important that the narrative be that ""feminists don't"" instead of ""society ought to""? Or perhaps asked a different way would be to ask why it is that feminists not acknowledging it is the fundamentally important part of addressing the issue? And to add to this, while it may very well be something that feminists haven't actually addressed or recognized, there's a level of malicious intent that's assigned to them in many instances, and I think that's a step too far. It's entirely conceivable that they are ignorant of it because they're focusing on other things. 

To put this in perspective, there's plenty of things that I can potentially feel empathy for, but if I'm put into a position where someone says that I lack empathy for an issue that I didn't realize was a problem it would put me on the defensive very quickly because it's accusing me of being a horrible person.

This argument is often muddied with this idiotic idea that rape is somehow different from other crime and that the targets are being ""blamed"" if they are told they should take precautions.

I shouldn't have to lock my doors at night, but if I left them open and I get robbed? That was stupid of me. It doesn't make the person who robbed me any less of a horrible person... but I could still have protected myself better. And even if I do everything right.. I can still get robbed. But that doesn't mean I shouldn't practice basic home security.

Yes, there should be a lot of effort to prevent rapists from assaulting people. But there are bad people in this world and pretending their isn't is stupid.

The fact is, there are men out there who prey on women in clubs. Women should be aware of how to minimise the risk of becoming a victim, not shun the idea because they ""shouldn't need to"".

">Because medically unnecessary surgery and medically unnecessary hormone treatments carry a high risk of health issues? Because SRS leads to infertility and complications? Because reinforcing the myth that gender roles are a natural thing harms everyone?

But that's exactly why this discussion is happening. I would rather be sterile and have to keep in decent physical condition, than go through life in a body that is just plain repulsive. 

You're entirely right on gender roles though, those are something that we should be fine without. In my experience though, trans people fall back on them because otherwise people will take it as a sign that they aren't really trans, but just want attention. It would be interesting to see how trans people act when their gender performance isn't being scrutinized.

>Acceptance of things you can't change isn't a bad thing, even if it's not an easy thing, even if you might have relapses sometimes. Introspection as to why one believes ""if only I was X, I would finally be happy"", although scary, is ultimately beneficial.

I agree that asking why is important, but not at the cost of being able to do everything else in life. 

I'm only nineteen, so I can't speak for all life experiences, but I have skipped out/ been terrified of so many things in my life because of the fact that I either felt disgusting or like a liar when people looked at me, especially in social situations. I tried accepting my body for years with no results except for a deeper voice and body hair. I'm not going to rattle off my whole life story, but suffice it to say that I don't consider acceptance bad, just not a realistic option for me or people like me. 

I've just reached a point where tangible results outweigh hypothetical ones. I would love to be convinced that none of this is necessary, but nothing that I've heard seems to indicate that I'm wrong.

As for children, I agree that three or four is too early for something like transition, but i'm sure that had I known it was an option a decade ago I would be much happier right now. 

Maybe in 40 years we'll all find out that I just had some easily treatable condition that, in retrospect, got blown way out of proportion. Until then though, I'd rather try to be happy than try to be a normal dude."

I agree with other players who said there should be an option for a full-black flash. I think I read about other people talking about it a few months ago, too, and not just in this thread.

Only issue is if it could technically give some sort of advantage. (maybe the fade from black is easier to see targets then fade from white?) and if that is true there would be some serious balance issues where people with the black flash can acquire and shoot targets easier then the people who use the default white flash. 

Reminds me of DayZ or other games where you can use a flashlight or nightvision. (Like CS 1.6 or CS:S, Insurgency, etc.)

A common tactic would be to jack your brightness and gamma WAY, WAY up, and you'd be able to see targets in the dark where they can't see you meaning you don't have to buy night vision optics, etc. "

Grey matter volume, inferior parietal lobe structure, etc., also favor men in regards to mathematical ability on average (and men score better on almost all measures of math aptitude -- SAT, AMC, AIME, math IQ, etc.).

"The prejudice in question is the prejudice maintained by some men that they are superior to women, because they are men. The justification they rely on is typically traditional cultural norms. Calling out a party for being sexist, is not itself sexist - and this particular brand is culturally ingrained and reinforced among men (ingrained and reinforced in them by women as well as men).

The usefulness of this term is that is specifies the brand of condescension being used. It also encompasses reference to the past tendency for this condescension to be considered justifiable by both men and women. I think that's the value in naming it accordingly - it can mock a past that has outlived it's welcome, and stun the argument into a new perspective. If it's misused, the abuse could and should be assertively called out and disarmed. Chances are, the conscious abuser will easily be made aware of their weak position.

I appreciate your thoughtful breakdown, and you make some good points. 

>In sum, condescension can be a product of sexist thinking, but it is not exclusive to it, so it need not be named accordingly and associated with it.

I appreciate this - and it's good reasoning for avoiding use of the word personally. I maintain that the somewhat comedic and light way that it calls a sexist premise into question as the reasoning for condescension is of value. A form of social progress through humor/satire and it's strength to effect appropriate shamming.

On another note - the best examples I'm coming up with in my head for how it can be used appropriately on a female perpetrator, relate to misjudgement of knowledge base (with prejudice factoring in) - a sort of overreliance on logic at the expense of empathy in an exchange - and mimicking behavior of associates affected by the behavior, second-hand (shit rolling downhill in a business environment). I'm not certain these are strong enough examples to warrant use - but they strike me as pretty good cases for it."

"How long do you think before Iran decides to kick out the inspectors? I don't believe that they'll give the inspectors uninhibited access for any reasonable amount of time. This is based on past behavior.
 

 My issue is, what is the difficulty of temporarily suspending enrichment for the chance of greater rewards; i.e., help in building the reactors, subsidizing fuel and monitoring their performance? Is it all going out the window just to show up the ""Great Satan?"" 

 The Iranians need to show that they can be a negotiating partner; yo-yoing between letting inspectors in and then arbitrarily kicking them out just demonstrates that they are unreliable. The schtick with the British sailors may have boosted their standings in the Middle East for the short term; but the majority of the Western world sees it as unpredictable behavior. Which in my opinion, will harm Iran's long term prospects.

"Never played a monster Hunter game before. 

The weapons seemed really jank and kinda complicated to use. I tried using a few different ones. I personally feel that in order to appeal to the masses it needs to simplify this.

I have no idea what these ""newer"" features are. I'm not a fan of that stupid bug tracking thing. The floating cloud rainbows really get in the way when I'm trying to look around at the absolutely breath taking world they made.

I am absolutely not sold yet. The jank controls put me off enough that I'm not buying in yet. Most of my friends weren't pleased with it either so I have no reason to buy it to play with friends. I might see if it drops in price after a few months and then maybe pick it up."

"you can't rescind consent after the fact especially in the case of any contract, written or verbal.

When it's verbal you have a big problem of proving the contract exists at all, which is a different question, but no, you can't just rescind consent.

If I say you can pitch a tent in my back yard and camp for the night, I can't rescind that offer and say you were trespassing. What I can do is withdraw permission to continue to do that in which case you'd have to vacate the premises in a reasonable timeframe. 

If I do a work for hire for a company, say making a painting for them, and they paid me for that painting, and displayed the painting, I can't just rescind consent for them to display the painting and also keep the money. Also, I can't force them to take the money back and give me the painting back if I have second thoughts. 

She's basically made an appeal to his better nature to delete this: if he has no better nature it won't work. He's said to her he'll do this if she returns the money she took from him for it, but she can't or won't do that, we don't know which. 

People just empathize about how they would feel in her shoes: and that feeling is ""not comfortable"" and so they want him to act in a way that would suit them. But he has a point, and he did make a gesture to her that he'll do it but he wants to get his money back and it's hard to say he shouldn't get that back. 

We can all say ""well I would be the bigger person if I were that guy and I would behave better"", but whenever I see people acting around me or to me, none of them ever take that role of the bigger person, everyone seems to just act selfishly and talk the big talk when it's someone else involved.

">If you'd like to justify the existence of the field then that's the definition of philosophy's problem.

The field exists to answer questions, not to force politicians to listen to the answers to those questions. Same applies to science. Philosophers are not public advocates and neither are scientists. 

Science did not put a man on the moon alone -- it required advocacy as well. It needed funding from governments. It needed people to be educated. None of that was done by science alone, it was done by advocates.

Let's say governments around the world start cutting funding for science and denying the existence of man-made climate change (oh, wait...) Would that be science's problem? 

There are philosophers doing things about their ethics and political philosophy -- I already pointed you to Singer and Habermas. The animal liberation movement was largely driven by philosophers. But there's only so much they can do.

>Back on earth we're still executing innocent people because your field can't figure out how to stop it.

It's not philosophy's job to figure out how to stop people from executing innocent people. That's the legal system's job. The legal system is run by lawyers.

It's also not philosophy's job to figure out how to stop people from executing people full stop. That's the legislature's job. The legislature is run by politicians.

Philosophy's job stops when it comes to a consensus on whether execution is justifiable. We've come to a consensus, more or less -- very few philosophers support capital punishment as far as I'm aware. So it's done. We're done with it. Advocates need to do the rest.

>How you guys remain so arrogant is beyond me.

The only arrogance in this thread is coming from you (notice how I never stroked my ego over the Enlightenment -- all I did was suggest that it was one success that can be attributed to philosophy, but that philosophy has moved on from it). All we're saying is that philosophy is not totally worthless, but notice that we don't then attack science for being totally worthless, or somehow worth less than philosophy. You, however, aren't happy with people acknowledging how great science is. You have to then attack other disciplines for not doing things that it's not their job to do."

I'm not joking when I say it feels like I lost the best friend/brother I've ever had. 

Through therapy I also understand now that I locked my 'self love' deep inside of me and somehow the only way I could access it was via sex. Now that I lost sex I was going mental/furious thinking that that bitch took all 'love' I've had inside of me. Destroyed my most precious gift. 
Luckily I now know that that's not the case I just need to find new ways to access it. I'm currently looking for some voluntary work. 

So as you see, even though other areas in life are improving I still really really miss my sexuality and probably will forever. That's why I'll never be my old self. I have to create a new persona which doesnt rely on sex. No idea how to do that yet.

I don't think the Reddit-specific female corollary is the spinster, but the cat-lady feminist - a person with incredibly enthusiastic opinions regarding gender, but who is vividly abject in that realm. When the red pillers and the TERFs fight each other, these are the things they accuse each other of being. Both sides are traumatized by gender and their inability to participate in it."

"29 yo, post-pubertal onset of 2ndary hypogonadism (low-normal LH/FSH levels but total T down in the 100-300 range before treatment)...

TLDR Version: Does hCG monotherapy often start working poorly? Why? What are my options?
I used Clomid 50mg/day before with great results but it stopped working when my IBS went from minor to severe. It's under control again, is it worth trying again?


Been around the block a few times. Tried Testosterone cypionate (T-cyp) for about a year and finally got to 200mg 1/week and felt slightly better. I learned the hard way that Endocrinologists are generally useless and clueless about hypogonadism. I've seen 2 university Urologists, and the first was more helpful than the second.
I used Clomid 50mg/day with awesome results for about a year. I have digestive disorders too and they went from mild to severe and the clomid stopped working. I suspect it was not being absorbed because of the digestive problems. My values were around 700-800 when I felt healthy. I was able to exercise 3/week (trail running for 40-75 minutes at 50-75% maxHR)

Since the clomid was so much better than the T-cyp, when it stopped working I got started on hCG. I was put on what I thought was a very conservative dose - 2,000IU 2/week. That didn't work well (T-test around 500 ng/dl and feeling fatigued 50% of days). We upped it to 2,000IU 3/week and I got up to about 750ng/dl and felt pretty good for a while.

Now I'm having symptoms again and I went in for a general checkup with bloodwork and found it's back at 525ng/dl. I asked to change the dose to alternating days to avoid having a bad day every week, and it came back at 499. 

I'd love to go back on the Clomid, but I have no idea if it would work. It ceasing to work did seem to correlate directly to my digestive problems, but the hard part is that my levels dropping is insidious and I'm not aware of it until they're really low. I'm using a new drug right now that is helping the digestive problems an amazing amount.

Obviously I need to talk to my Dr. What kind of things have others tried? I've seen a couple papers talking about hCG needing to be dosed up to 10,000 IU daily to maintain normal testosterone levels. I see a lot of parroted things from anabolic steroid users about how 500 IU is a high dose and Leydig cell desensitization, but nothing about it in any scientific papers. 
I don't have any particular issue with using massive amounts of hCG, I just want to know if it's going to be counterproductive in time. I'm sure there's a point where you get diminished returns, I just don't know where that point is or how much they are diminished.

I think it would really help to know why I'm having these issues in the first place, but everyone just seems to want to manage symptoms.

"I wasn't a frequenter of this sub in the ""macwithoutfries"" days so I have no opinion as to whether or not these might be the same people.

A few observations, though:

 It is clear there are a small number of people who routinely employ sock puppets on this sub, repeatedly engage in trollish behavior and, when banned, soon resurrect themselves under a different name. It is always one of two profiles: a) account created six or eight months ago (or even longer), zero comments, zero submissions, then all of a sudden and shortly after a known troll is banned, near hyper activity OR b) brand new account + recent troll banning + instant hyper activity. Either way, what has occurred is quite obvious.

 There are days when the up/down voting really only make sense when comparing comment tallies in context of the sub itself if there are a small number of people using multiple sock puppets in specific instances / in support of specific individuals

 I first started frequenting this sub around when N_I_G did. At that time most of his/her comments were (of course) pro-AGW, but were also I felt fairly measured in tone and content - at least insofar as this debate is concerned. Over the last 60 days or so I have noted a striking degradation to the point where mostly all I see now are personal attacks, insults and general flaming. The profile actually tracks quite nicely against the ""Concern Troll"" description that Alyssa posted elsewhere a little while back in response to another person.



At any rate, if you'd asked me awhile ago if I thought N_I_C is a troll whose presence is unnecessary here I would have said no. I probably wouldn't say the same today.

Also, on a related yet unrelated note, I kinda miss greenmaurader. He was funny if occasionally way over the top."

"Damn, I'm going to comment on this from the perspective of a guy who has kind of lived that life over the last half a century with the aim of hopefully passing on some of what I think I've learned. I do this to possibly help anyone else following along this convoluted path.

Being ""smart"" is really a double-edged sword, society seems to demand the world from you but since you're so smart they do very little to support you because they expect that you'll figure it out for yourself.

Now, add to that the issue that many of us figure out very early on that society is basically fucked in the way it rationalizes things and compound that by whatever twisted sense of ethics we are taught as well as decide for ourselves - and there's no wonder that many of our ilk have breakdowns.

If you are willing to accept the above, what we can and more importantly should accomplish is a widely varied palette, one that allows us a lot of flexibility.

This leads me to point out that identifying what it is that you want out of life is far more important than trying to answer what it is you are going to do with your life - because most of us (you) will do a lot of different things throughout the course of the next half century.

For me, applying myself to what I see as the ""big problems"" (you know the ones, the issues that everyone writes off as unsolvable) provides me with the comfort of believing I am making a difference. But making a difference in this manner means that the overwhelming majority can't or won't grasp what you're attempting to do nor will they rally behind it. 

Still, in cases where we are successful, we move humanity forward, as Norman Borlaug did. Conversely, if it is important to ""make a name for yourself"" many people have no idea who Borlaug was or what he did - so maybe you might want to devote your life to becoming a pop star, you know, like Justin Beiber.

What kinds of problems am I talking about?

How about constructing a societal system which allows for the best possible lifestyle for every single person, not just those who create wealth for themselves.

Okay - sounds easy, right?

What components of that goals prevent this from happening?

Some of the sticking points that I believe are holding us back from achieving this goal are: energy, housing, communications, transportation, food, a reliable/trustworthy system of justice, and the list goes on for as far and deep as anyone wishes to analyze the problem.

Pick one - and run with it.

In many cases you may never see the result of your work but you just might have a conversation with someone which could provide them with the one spark that they need to make the necessary breakthrough.

Have at it - because if you can believe anything they tell us, we are the best hope for humanity's future - and if that doesn't scare the everloving shit out of you, ain't nothing ever going to.

"Hah, fair enough. Well I'm not sure what it is about how I'm speaking that makes it seem that way. I guess I have just adopted a certain style of speaking after being subjected to people over and over completely ignoring the role of diet in their health outside of ""calories in, calories out"".

Honestly I don't see the point in being a self-righteous twat. If I didn't want to help people then I wouldn't bother saying anything. I just am frustrated that so many of our problems today are caused by diet. Even for cases where the underlying cause isn't caused by diet (though things like coeliac's can be fully healed by adhering to a strict diet for around a year  http  ). I'm pretty sure my allergies count as an ""autoimmune disorder"" but whatever. I'm not trying to downplay anyone else's struggles with health, and I most definitely sympathise, but I actually don't think it's all that hard to ""understand"" either. I've had to adhere to a very strict diet and turn down pretty much any food anyone offers me for the last 5 years. I had months where I couldn't breathe properly at night and was worried I was going to die as I recalled my dad having similar problems when I was a teenager, and then he died when I was 17. Even my own family keep offering me the same things every time I go visit them, even after 7 years of figuring out the root cause of my poor health and depression (which has not recurred since improving my diet). My sisters have ended up improving their diet to lose weight, and they're starting to be more aware of the role of food in things like my nephew's mood, but I usually bite my tongue at doing anything other than give occasional anecdotes about things that have helped my health and mood (which is clearly, drastically different from when I was younger - even my boss at work noticed and asked me what had changed).

>As for diet, it can be a tool in your arsenal but it is not a cure by any means

For your specific case yes, but in other cases, a healthy diet actually is a cure, since poor diet is the causative factor in the vast majority of pretty much all of our current worst offending health problems, from heart disease to cancer. And I'm not even exaggerating in the slightest when I say that. It's crazy the number of things that trace back to digestive disturbances and poor diet, but people then just think it's a symptom rather than the cause.

So, sorry if I'm coming across as a self-righteous twat, but hopefully you also see where I'm coming from. And seriously I've looked at the pattern of downvoting in the past. I've actually had comments that I expected to be downvoted because of my attitude, but as long as I was only ever mentioning things that ""everyone knows"" like ""calories in vs calories out"" then I'd be consistently upvoted. It's when I post things that people are cynical of that I get downvoted, so I just generally try to make people think about the ""next level down"" from their current level of understanding about food, since I know from my own experience and general consensus that it's hard to permanently change your diet in anything but small increments, until the new knowledge and ideas become a habit and then you can further work at improving things.

"I hope this doesn't get anyone upset, but as a person who tries to understand an assortment of faiths, I get confused by several things.

1) Why isn't the Zionist movement considered racist, or at the very least separationalist? The Jewish community has been ostracized and shunned from many places throughout history. To me it seems like it's no different than Muslim's enforcing Sharia Law, or Mormons enforcing strict values upon their communities... 

2) I notice a ton of people disagreeing on specific things in relation to the Torah, and more specifically a general separation within your own community. How does that affect Judaism? Christianity is broken down into thousands of sects, but it is different than Judaism because Judaism has fought tooth and nail to become one community.

3) For instance, Jews appear to form deep communities that are occasionally do not coincide with our modern melting pot. I believe we need to continue to mold our society as a whole, rather than separating it by religion or race. Jews were segregated and shunned from societies over and over, but is Judaism itself not separating within? For instance, how can a a traditional Orthodox Jew cry foul on history, and yet at the same time be anti-homosexual? Shouldn't we be promoting minority movements for fear that what happened to the Jews could happen to them?

4) How do I respect your beliefs, your practices and thoughts without coming off as anti-Semitic? I don't want to appear that way, but sometimes the statements I make definitely sound it. "

">1) Actually, it's because Sikhs formed a tiny pocket of the population that would make absolutely no sense to have its own country. Sikhs still had quite the clout in Partition dealings despite this. 

Sikhs were the originally land owners of what became pakistan. How is it fair to create a country without and against the wishes of the original landowners? And whose whole religion and holyland is splitting of that land? Obvious to me, as I stated earlier, it was a British colonial plan who had their puppets in place to ensure Sikhs never regained their powerful Sikh empire and political sovereignty. Its just common sense when you connect the dots. We would be politically very naive to think the Brits never had or dont have agents all over the place, because we know they had dogra hindu agents in the Sikh empire and they had sikh military brahmin agents (generals teja and laal singh amoung others)

>2) From what we know so far, they had no involvement in 1984 as we know it. Indira requested help and the British provided a plan using helicopters and commandos to evict Bhindranwale while minimizing civilian casualties. As we know, Indira Gandhi chose not to go with this and rolled tanks into Darbar Sahib which if anything helped maximize civilian casualties.

Your right about Ranjits empire not being a true Sikh raj it was more sanatan Sikhi as you said.

As for British assistance in 1984....it should have been towards the Sikhs who they had victimised since 1840s it should not have been for the despotic regime of Indira gandhi. Plus the american CIA was already meddling in Indian punjab via their well placed agents and their allies in pakistani ISI so why did British govt military assist a soviet allied country (india) when it would make sense to aid the Sikh rebels in order to create more trouble for the soviet enemies during the cold war. It just goes to show Sikh lives did not matter to them, as long as they made money from military training and arms sales and other economic trade deals they would assist anyone willing flash their cash."

"> It's rhetoric like that that makes me not want to...

Not rhetorical; you seemed to be focussed on that one sentence in isolation, when it was largely as an aside and the meat of the argument followed. In any case, I don't take ""why is there something rather than nothing?"" to be highly technical philosophy lingo. (Obviously, exploring that problem would get into highly technical philosophy stuff pretty quickly.)

>Anyway, my point is that Krauss has not redefined terms. My point is that he's using his terms exactly as his intended audience understands them, 

Krauss' intended audience is laypeople as you noted. I think it would be rather extraordinary if anyone understood ""why is there something rather than nothing"" to mean ""how does stuff appear in quantum fields."" If someone asked you ""why is there something rather than nothing"" and you said ""well, stuff appears in quantum fields in this certain way"" the most obvious question you'd get is ""okay.... so why is there a quantum field that does that?"" People are looking for basic explanations of why there are any states of affairs, if you will.

Now to be clear, I personally doubt Krauss is really redefining anything. I think he understands the question of ""why is there something rather than nothing"" in the entirely ordinary, non-technical sense, and thinks the quantum field stuff actually sheds light on the actual question at hand. Casting this into a merely semantic squabble seems to be a more common issue in discussions of the new atheists (as with the post I originally replied to). I am pointing out what I see as the reasons why that approach doesn't rescue Krauss here.

This is more or less a strawman argument. You don't need to be oppressed to have knowledge of oppression. Bigoted fists do not infuse knowledge directly into your skull.

You've presented a specific scenario, that the conversation hasn't been about up until this point. The scenario of middle class, white men sitting around mocking oppressed groups (let's skip the ""historically part, so that it's more relevant) and them telling them that they shouldn't do this. You do realise that the reason they shouldn't do that is not because they're white males, but because it's wrong, right? I hope you do.

This is still about the bigotry of dismissing someone's points because of their race, ethnicity, sex, sexuality or class. Or anything else pertaining to their person, really. This is a type of bigotry common amongst SRS users, and they seemingly don't understand why it's wrong to do so.

This isn't what we're talking about. Like I mentioned in my previous posts, being white doesn't preclude you from understanding. Black women do not have monopoly on such knowledge. Either way, you shouldn't tell someone why they shouldn't be offended by anything, as that's completely subjective. Regardless of your race, sex, sexuality or class.

"I think a lot of it has to do with the sense that you're trying to use casual forms in an improper context.

Casual Japanese is only used among family members, close friends in a casual setting (so, you'd speak politely to your BFF at work), by your boss/senpai (theoretically, and then s/he's speaking down to you), and little kids who don't know better. So when you speak casual Japanese in the wrong context, it sounds unnatural/childish and can be incredibly rude.

High school students will use casual Japanese with each other, but that's because they're part of the same in-group and that kids can get away with it. However, high school kids use polite speech with their teachers.

It's as artificial as any other title conferred to someone based on education or experience. Plumber's Assistants aren't called plumbers.

Sure. And that's the real difference. You see it clearly but you fail to recognize it, I think. The education IS the difference.

"I'm not saying that we ""should"". I'm just pointing out that a consistent framework is derived from them. And they seem to hold together well, in every sense that I can test them.

Go back to the plant analogy. We don't have much insight into what it's like to be a plant. It probably isn't ""like"" anything, frankly.

But, from the outside, we can tell if a plant is doing ""well"" or ""poorly"", at least after we've learned about plants. We can determine that a certain ratio of light to shade and a certain frequency of watering results in the plant being healthy.

There's probably quite a bit of wiggle room in the range of healthy light and water exposure. But, there is a gradient in the space of possible light/dark/water combinations. And some places are ""better"" for the plant than others.

Humans are much more complex and complicated than plants, but we have much more insight into the human condition. We decide how we ""flourish"". We can decide on our own axioms: who else could do so for us?"

"I'm so confused. How does being pregnant equate to being a plot device? It makes zero sense to me. I find the pregnancy plot line really interesting given all of Touka and Kaneki's issues have arisen from a parent, and the baby being born would represent them moving past those issues.

And your point about her development happening ages ago is just wrong. For one, the focus of her characterisation in the original wasn't in the form of development but was to reveal all the layers and depth to her character. 

We're initially inroduced to the hot headed girl who'd fight against any injustice done to her, and then the girl who longs to live like a human, and has a strong attachment to them. And then we see the person who desperately protects her loved ones, to the point where she'd throw away her own life. And then we see her insecurities over her ghoul identity, and then her self loathing because of how the people important have left her, and she blames herself for that. And at her core is her abandonment issues and desire to be loved/not be left alone. That's so many different layers to her character, which gives so much depth and complexity to her, and can only be matched by Kaneki.

And then seeing how much she's changed across all these different layers shows her wrong your comment is regarding her lack of development. She's obviously no longer the hot headed figure she was at the start, and as you mentioned her growth away from violence in the orginal plays a large role in that (and this arc occurs throughout the whole of the original, literally about to go to university, rather than fighting as a ghoul). She no longer has a strong urge to live like a human, and rather has adopted a fatalistic view that she's a ghoul living in this world, so to live is to lose things, something she learnt after Anteiku raid, which also contributes to her maturation. She doesn't throw her life away to protect the people around her anymore, but has accepted she has to lose things and sees value in her existance, as shown in this arc. Her abandonment issues and desire to be loved have been adressed through her relationship with Kaneki. Their relationship has equally driven both their growth as characters. 

And she still has a lot of room to grow, her self loathing and insecurity over her ghoulhood have yet to be adressed, and she has repressed her emotions a lot in this arc, something she needs to grow from, linking back to her abandonment and self loathing. She probably doesn't want to burden others with her feelings, out of fear of them abandoning her. 

This was way too long for a basic summary of her character, but that's just a testament to how much depth there is to one of the best written characters I've ever seen."

Nope. Follow the link and read the legal definition of censorship. Intent is not a requirement. If the speech is suppressed because it is deemed unacceptable, then it has been censored. Rule 11 specifies that ghazi threads are unacceptable in r/KiA, and therefore they are suppressed. Yes, this matches the legal definition of censorship.

That's not my logic at all. Please don't straw man me. Even if it WAS my logic, Austin has about a million citizens, and New York has about 8 million, so that's only a factor of 8 difference. Compare that to r/KiA that has over 1000 regular viewers VS r/KiAChatroom that has about a dozen... that's a ONE HUNDRED FOLD difference. Your comparison is off by two orders of magnitude. Besides, New Yorkers that don't like the Yankees don't get shipped off to Austin because of it. This analogy is awful. Why did you say this?

Now, you clearly don't understand what I'm saying. You seem to have seized onto my use of the phase ""head of state"" and refuse to let go, even though that's essentially irrelevant to my point.

Let me be as clear as possible. Earlier in this conversation, you described Barack Obama (and indeed anyone who holds the presidency) as ""the highest individual in the land."" Unless the president is vacationing at the peak of Mt. Whitney, I'm assuming you mean that he's the most powerful person in the country. If I misunderstood you due to your poor phrasing, please let me know now.

Now, if I understood you correctly, you're saying that the president is the most powerful person in the country. Tim Thomas does not believe that the federal government should have so much political power, and that the president shouldn't have so much political power. He is therefore protesting the power that is held by both the federal government and the president by declining his invitation.

That is as clear as I can make my point."
"Thank you for the detailed response! I totally agree with your first remarks about grading adding pressure on younger children, I think to me equally alarming is that it makes the focus on grades vs. knowledge and I think this is really damaging in the early education of a child because it shapes their view of learning (as something to be done for a grade, vs. something to be down out of curiosity or an urge for self improvement). My follow up question would be, do you think that upon going to the higher grades, 9th - 11th that grading was necessary? How do you think that the older grades would have gone for you and your peers if you had continued not receiving grades?

I love the idea of the smiley faces, I will totally be using that with my classes in the future. What I love about it is how the assessment comes from the students perspective and I think it is really clever because it is their emotional reaction to how they felt things went which leads to good, non-judgmental conversations like ""What can we work on today to turn your :| face into :) face for this material?""

We have a similar problem to what you described in the United States, students will ask ""Will this be on the test?"", ""Is this going to be on the state exams?"", or just stop paying attention when they feel that the work will not be on the test. It's totally not their fault though, it's the system that gives them this perspective here: state tests drive the entire curriculum all throughout middle and high school. Their performance on state tests determines teacher ratings, school ratings, and whether their school is shut down or receiving additional funding (for good results), so they feel a lot of pressure from a lot of external forces about these exams.

As for the others, I thought Fjord was out of line drawing his sword on Caleb in the middle of the heist, since if he had left it alone they might have escaped without being caught.

When most people's first concern is finding or holding onto their own shit job, and making ends meet by any means necessary, they're not going to give a damn about this stuff, nor should they. You're in essence asking people to pay more to subsidize people who are already better off than they think they are.

All this pity for poor Canada Post is just obscene. They're a horrible company, with a long history of piss poor management, and yet they still manage to remain profitable due to their monopolistic and predatory nature.

Simply put, as a vendor you have one concern: doing better than the other guys in your neck of the woods. If you can't do that, someone else will. There are no pleas for sympathy for the poor Canadian business, appeals to patriotism or anything else. It's about the goods you carry and the price you sell them for, and how well you can convince people they need what you have, nothing more.

This rant smacks of condescension. It's going to have the opposite effect of what you're hoping. You're basically telling people exactly how they're saving money by buying anywhere other than from you or other local businesses.

The sounder strategy, which most local business do, is to outwardly pretend China doesn't exist, incentivize using their own shops/services, try to create buzz around your name, and most of all not whine about competition. It's silly to expect to convert people already using direct from China shops, and the last thing you should want to do is spread awareness of the significant advantages to potential customer's bank balances."

> I'm also a big fan of Belgian and some Czech beers. Do you have any preference? 

Usually I drink Pilsner and Weizen from local breweries. One of my favorites which might just be popular enough that you could come across it in the US is ""Rothaus"". 

In Germany most brands still stick with the traditional ""Reinheitsgebot"" an agreement (originally a set of binding rules) to only use barley (later on also wheat), hop and malt [Edit] whoops I forgot to mention water, lol. I'm very German in this respect, I don't like when there's too much sweetener or other stuff added. But I do like occasionally a cool ""Radler"" (beer with lemonade) in summer. But then I prefer to add the lemonade myself, the stuff you can buy is usually too sweet for my taste. 

There's not too much foreign beer in the supermarkets or pubs. I do like Guinness and I also tried a few Belgian beers, they are having a broader variety of beers. The sweet stuff is not my favorite, but I like some of the other beers, particularly the darker ones. My experience with Beligian beer ranges from is this really supposed to taste like fermented apple juice to damn why don't they sell this stuff over here. They don't sell much Czech beer around here but as far as I can tell they are really good and young Germans often visit the Czech Republic for summer trips, because the beer's good and cheap. 

I don't really know many American beers, Budweiser is probably the most popular one around here. It's good, but it's pretty expensive and to me it's not that special that it would rectify the price. I tried a few American Lagers (don't remember the brands) to me they are missing something, I prefer a little more ""bitterness"". I recently had a ""Brooklyn Brown Ale"" in a restaurant, I even took a picture of the bootle to help me remember the name, that one was really good.

>This weather site shows United States Extreme Record Temperatures and Ranges from NCDC. Of all fifty states, only five records occurred after 1980, whereas thirty six occurred before 1940.

First of all, what kind of weird reasoning is this? Temperatures are clearly going up, and I keep hearing that ""no skeptic"" denies that the globe is warming. So by showing more record heat waves in the past you are saying... that it's not warming? That it is warming but that somehow it isn't warming? What? 

And second, you have to look at the ratio of heat waves to cold spells. A new paper shows that there are more heat waves compared to cold spells.

"> what happens when sexists (in your example) decide to polish a turd and call it ""benevolent sexism"".

Except it's not sexists who came up with the term. Feminists did. You know, the anti-sexism brigade. That's the part that is boggling my mind right now…

>What, in your opinion differentiates from plain old fashioned sexism?

It's not different from plain old fashioned sexism. It's identifying the different forms that sexism takes. 

And I, personally, don't tend to lump ""hostile sexism"" and ""benevolent sexism"" together as the feminists do, simply for the fact that many women benefit from and seem to enjoy ""benevolent sexism.""

I will stop being ""benevolently sexist"" just as soon as women stop encouraging and rewarding my behavior.

Which is my whole problem with the conversation with sexism - women can be and often are just as sexist (if not more, since their ""sisterhood"" and even society at large tends to support and condone their sexism) as men but face none of the condemnation for it that men do. 

>Uh... because it was ALL the women and only some of the men. Pretty simple to understand.

"Hello misterrunon,

I've done three of the 10 day Goenka retreats, two in the USA and one in India but I have not served as a volunteer. Nor have I ever had any contact with AT's or any part of the organization outside of a retreat. But I have had some considerable experience with other teachings teachers and organizations most of which were yogic.

>I feel the courses are taught in an impersonal manner, a lowest common denominator style...feel this sense of lacking...repeat the one thing: ""just pay attention to your sensations.""

You are not alone in having that feeling, I have gotten the impression that many people feel frustrated by the relentless simplicity of the teaching Goenka insisted on. If you want personalized teaching a Goenka retreat is not the place to look for it.

>I still don't understand why he iterates that his interpretation of the buddha's teachings is the only way that works in liberation.

That was/is simply Goenka's truth, that is what he sincerely believed/knew and it is why he did all the work that he did in order to spread his method of teaching around the world.

>but why can't we use an object to calm the mind as beginners? Why can't we use it as a crutch until we are able to concentrate on the pure and unregulated breath?

I'm not sure I understand this one. Are you wondering why Goenka did not allow students to use mantras or count the breath while seeking teachings/instruction from him? Clearly Goenka saw no need for such additional techniques.

>It seems like there's a lot of drama, hierarchy and egoism going on at the centers...

As I said I have not served at a center and I do not doubt your experience. What I would find amazing is if there were not drama and egoism. Spend a hundred years traveling the earth visiting every type of ashram, monastery, nunnery and you will not find a single one that is free of such human tendencies. As far as the ""hierarchy""...well there has to be to one degree or another a hierarchical order or such retreats would be full of confusion chaos and committee meetings, and in such an atmosphere there would be very little effective practice happening.

"I used to prefer my LBS over giant internet warehouses until I started getting better service from the Internet. Out of spite I bought a stand and some tools online and I've been wrenching by myself ever since. I can rely on their customer reviews help me choose the right parts. When I buy the wrong parts because I have absolutely no idea what I'm on about I can just saunter into my lbs, because I'm a good customer of course, and ask them to exchange the Italian bottom bracket I bought online for the right one, which they will have to help me find. 

One LBS had the gall to try and charge me full retail for a part I can buy online from an ebayer in China for less than shimano wholesales the product for. Look, I want to support my local scene as much as the next guy, but if they can't get within 50 cents of the online price I can't even be bothered.

"There are three parties to any public conversation- you, the other person, and the observer(s). There is also the greater context in which the conversation occurs, and the greater topics involved. 

For example: if I call out my racist uncle at Thanksgiving for being a trash person and a bigot, it's not just about him. He is not likely to be influenced anyway (because he's an arrogant shit who is set in his ways). The one who is likely to be influenced is the young cousin who sees confrontation of a racist, bigoted paradigm (promoted by the Uncle as ""True""). That is just as important, if not more important, because there are significantly longer-lasting effects. You're right, the bulk of it and the message is subconscious, but that doesn't actually matter because human communication is 90% nonverbal anyway.

Similarly, shooting a klansmen isn't just stopping that klansman; it's sending a message to other klansmen and to their victims.

I know that sounds like a sidetrack point, but it is a significant part of the issue in play: 

Declaring something as virtue signaling is to declare it a singular, self-centered, and hypocritical incident, and the one speaking as fundamentally selfish, when that is not often the case- standing up against injustice (in whatever form) is specifically an unselfish act. Sure those self-centered loudmouths exist and there are selfish loudmouths out there, but to paint something you disagree with as such is very manipulative and degrading; it is a cleverly crafted ad-hominem attack. These aren't televangelists pandering for donations from poor, gullible fools to buy their second jet.

On top of that, ""having conversations about a topic with a group of people who agree"" isn't simply ""in-group performance"" at all- that is literally how we learn and refine our opinions. Everyone does this. Painting it as self-centered is absolutely disingenuous and manipulative, and nothing but a bad faith argument.

This is a reddit forum and that was an off-handed comment; I don't have the time nor resources to conduct a peer-reviewed research study and you know it.

Don't pretend otherwise.

"We probably agree on more than we disagree. I'm sat here as we speak with some Linda McCartneys vegetarian sausages under the grill so I'm by no means against the idea of cutting back on meat. 

But as someone who's been on the breadline I've got to disagree with you. Meat is cheaper than the alternatives. You can fill your tummy and get your daily calories and energy for much cheaper with a big bag of frozen chicken than you can with the alternative. I can go to the shops now and get about 4kg of chicken breasts for about £10. Alternative products like soya are much more expensive, even own-brand options. Vegetables and fruits are equally expensive. Cheeses, milks and oils are expensive and in the cases of cheeses and milks are similarly problematic. Carbs in the way of bread, potatos and pasta can be got cheap but I'm not sure with the obesity issue we should be encouraging people to cut down on meat and overindulge on those. Eating ethically, if you can do such a thing in a capitalist society, does hit the pocket. Most of the cheap alternatives to meat that you can name are probably not farmed ethically anyway so I have reservations about how big an impact a diet change would even be. 

So I disagree on that point. Income does play a role. There is a reason poor people buy meat products and its because it's cheap and easy and a good source of protein. 

But I really don't like this idea poor people are entitled because they buy water-filled mass produced meat and microwave meals when doing their weekly shop. There's a reason most vegetarians are from stable middle class homes. Abstaining from meat is a luxury from my experience. "

So tell your coworker she’s a talented actress and should consider tv work.

It’s further likely that after the fact she reduced the story to ‘I cried and a cop gave me no ticket’. Just because the opression works in your favour doesn’t mean it wasn’t oppression. This situation is merely a byproduct of how society interprets women as a whole. In any case my point has nothing to do with your coworker and nothing to do with crying, it’s with the wording of OPs comment, which makes it out to be a totally unfair and great thing that women totally take advantage of which is untrue.

Well, if struggle (most struggle) leads to greater satisfaction, why do you not support everyone and every culture and every xyz and 123. More struggle would lead to more satisfaction, so why not? Because you are not a part of those cultures. You do not sympathize as much with them (which is perfectly normal). Well, apply that logic to my situation - I'm mentally ill. My culture says that I am going to end up as a rapist or murderer or Charlie Manson. Why should I support a culture that I cannot empathize with? 
 
And yes, my depression is a part of my past, of course it has affected my outlook. That would be like saying, do you think being raped affected your outlook?

That is straight, honest and too the point without regards to your feelings.

Now with that out of the way. Let's look at the points of information that your wife presented. 

1) She's been presented with a contract
2) She's unsure of said contract.

Now. You're saying that I should've asked for more information. In this instance, there is no more information required for my comment. It doesn't matter if the sub is new or experienced. It's a HUGE red flag. If a sub is presented a contract that they do not agree with. They need to throw that contract away! That's it. It's that simple. There is no arguing here. There is no room for error. Getting consent through a contract is not how this world works. And I'm going to let you know, that if you ever run into a sub on here or in real life tell you that she is presented with a contract that she doesn't agree with. The first words out of your mouth are: ""Don't sign it!"".

Now for the 50 shades a Grey part of my comment. That was not an implication of you two being posers or noobs. In the book Grey tries to get his girl to consent by signing a contract. Now with the two points that your wife presented outlined above, you can see how these two situations sound similar. Hence the 50 shades of Grey part of the comment. Arguably, I could've explained this part better.

With that said, you can hopefully understand why my comment is absolutely appropriate for what your wife presented. Now about your ""please don't post in here"" comment I can safely say go fuck yourself. I said the right thing for the information presented. It might have hurt your or your wife's feelings. But it will only be temporary. You'll both get over it.

Now let's get back to the issue at hand. Your wife used the word contract, you say it's not a contract but even your description sounds something like a contract. Especially if your wife/sub decides that she wants to follow it to closely to be a good sub.

So what is this document? How does it differ from a contract?

You mentioned that it outlines expectations, goals, and protocols. That sounds similar to a contract.

What is the purpose of this document?

You say your wife is new. What experience does she have?

Why do you need to have your expectations/protocols written down? If she's new as you say, don't you think this is too early? If she's new, shouldn't she be allowed to experience this world first and then once she has some base of understanding. Then she can start talking about protocols and expectations? How can she even discuss these things if she's new?

Why do you think this type of document is good for her?

Most importantly, why would your wife feel like these documents would destroy her identity?

As for when I was new. Yes, people came down my throat a few times. And it honestly did make me smarten up.

">A) They don't need to earn a living wage.

How are we defining a living wage? Because I'm defining it as ""enough money to be able to afford basic necessities such as a place to live, food, utilities, etc."" Personally, I would say yes, in fact, they do need to earn a living wage. Unless you think anyone who isn't a skilled laborer should be homeless if they don't have a friend or relative to take them in while they work their way up to a higher-paying job?

>So, first, they don't need to earn ""x amount."" If they're earning, say $2/hour, is that $2 more than $0? Apparently, the answer is objectively ""yes.""[1]

A, yes, condescension. That's always a great way to get people to listen to you.

Yeah, obviously, $2 an hour is still better than no money at all. In most cities in the US, $2 an hour isn't even remotely close to being enough to pay for rent and food even if you worked two full-time jobs at that rate.

>And what happens? They get experience, and eventually move on to a better job, and get paid more.

So they start out homeless and borderline starving, but that's okay, because if they just work hard enough some day they'll have a job that actually allows them to afford a first world standard of living? I'm not buying it.

I mean, look, I know that without minimum wage, a lot of goods would be cheaper, and jobs would be easier to find. But would it be enough to make up for the fact that unskilled laborers now make next to nothing? I find that doubtful.

"Yes. To put it simply, I can no longer deal with the state of the Vatican. I'm not even referring to the sex scandals or anything like that, as I know that the actions of certain priests does not make the whole church like them; but I refer to other things.

In the Catholic church, we are expected to become servants of the church. That part is fine, I believe that we can and should serve the church, but Catholicicsm takes it to another level, where we are to be subservient to the church and to do its bidding. At a local level this is usually not a problem, the priests and the bishops have the best interest in heart usually and concern themselves with pastoral care; the problem stems from abroad. Cardinals and the Pope (who I have much, much respect for) each time determine more and more teachings which are to be accepted without question. Funnily enough, the topic of papal infallibility, which I am told at certain times ALWAYS applies, and when questioning it that is SOMETIMES applies, wasn't even something until 1869, in which it was declared under infallibility that the Vatican was now infallible. Whenever someone in the church is confused about a topic, or the have a question, both the priest and the members are pretty helpless. More than once, whenever I tried to speak to the priest at moments of spiritual crisis, I was given a one or two sentence cliche response, told to pray 3 hail Mary's and shown the door. Just the other day at confession I told the priest of the doubts I was having and all he could say was that the RCC has been around 2000 years. When something is asked among laypeople, the question often turns into a round of finger pointing and a competition of holiness. Simply ask a question or try to discuss points in r/Catholicism, you will see what I mean. I don't expect the world t agree with me, and I accept that I may be wrong, but usually calling your brothers and sisters heretics doesn't help them develop their faith. Also ask a question regarding church teaching and the response is always a 10 page manuscript of canon law written in purposely vague terms. The source for belief in the Catholic church always turns out to be the Catholic church. If you asked why we believe in a certain thing, you will be presented with a document that basically states ""because the Vatican/Pope says so"". Makes me wonder how solid a certain belief must be when we need to refer to a 30 or 40 page document to explain it. Hell the other day I disagreed with a Catholic brother/sister at r/Catholicism over the dangers of intertwining the church and the secular government and I was called a heretic for disagreeing with a heresy declared in the early 1800s aptly called ""Americanism"". When I refuted it citing [Matthew 22:21] and [John 18:36], I was told that Catholics are discouraged from reading and interpreting scripture. I think it'd be just dandy for the church if we were all illiterate again and disallowed from ever opening a Bible then.

Furthermore, I've had personal experiences in the church which have also slowly drawn me from it. Some masses are a joke, the music sounds like a Christian pop concert and sometimes I wonder whether I am at a megachurch service or something. The church in the US is also neglecting its other duties in its preoccupation with abortion and homosexuality. I definitely condemn the abortion, as a person, not evena Christian, I find it murderous. Yet I fail to see the efficacy of picketing at abortion clinics, only to get into physical confrontations with the patients, get bad publicity for the church, etc. We can pray to God that the practice end from the church, without needing to get into fights with others. I don't even know why we care about homosexuals doing this or that. We don't marry, they don't want us to marry them, leave them to do their thing; most of them aren't even religious. Much more people worried about those two topics than say participating in St. Vincent de Paul. A couple times I experienced the church taking time from the mass to encourage people to vote a certain way, and putting politics into the mass. One of the parishes I went to even ending every mass with the ""religious freedom prayer"" which the bishop came up with and everyone was expected ot recite it right after communion. I've read threads and heard stories of priests who outright state which candidates to vote or not vote for. 

That's the gist of why. I don't discourage you from continuing your journey in the Catholic church though, it's a beautiful church with many good people, and my reasons are mine only. Maybe I will regret it and come back (or to Orthodoxy) someday, I don't know; but hopefully I am taking a step in the right direction, to a tradition that is very similar in practice to the RCC but hasn't entangled itself in conflicting claims of ultimate authority and come up with ridiculous heresies. Please let me know your reasons as well, and how your experience in the RCC goes.

>There's been no fight for feminists. From the very beginning, they were helped and protected.

From whom? If they had been helped and protected from the very beginning? Gee, I don't suppose it was from men harassing them for wanting autonomy of their mind and body.

> So there was no toil, no suffering, no fight.

Uhhu, tell that to the girls that get sold into prostitution because they are deemed worthless if they are not males; tell that to the thousand of women murdered in Juarez that were raped and disposed of as toilet paper after it's been used; tell that to the women that can't drive or even step out into the streets if they don't have a male companion, otherwise it's illegal; tell that to the girls that have their genitals mutilated so they can't enjoy sex, because it's ""impure"" for women to enjoy sex or because their virginity has to be preserved for the perfect dick. Uhhu, no toil.

I'm by no means downplaying the issues that also plague men, cause I know men also face their own set of problems; but just like men have specific problems correlated to their gender, so do women and you can't turn a blind eye to them.

"People who complain about this are either new switchers who are just used to how things are done in other OSs, or just trolls.

As others have pointed out, the Macintosh OS has a much closer relationship with the mouse than Windows. The mouse, despite inevitable droning about the number of buttons, is a much more considered input device on the Macintosh - for instance: spring-loaded folders, windows becoming key and moving into position when items dragged over them, and Exposé.

To enhance the ability to multitask with a mouse (rather than keyboard shortcuts) windows must not be full screened. Full screen applications completely remove all possibility of easy multitasking with the mouse. To a great degree it's true that with fullscreen apps: Other windows peeking out can't be clicked and brought the the front, files can't be dragged in from the desktop, etc.

On top of this issue there's the incredibly important effect of spacial awareness on the desktop. the Macintosh tends to provide the user with more clues that there are other windows around, that windows exist in a stack and can be reordered, that other things are happening and can be interacted with: that this is a real space with real windows you might almost reach out and touch and feel and reorder! These things are incredibly powerfully linked to the parts of our brain which deal with spatial awareness - this is the root of intuition! Not so with the fetish for full-screen applications on Windows. Our brains simply aren't built to deal with instantly changing screens with no apparent order or relation to other screens we may have been using or about to use. An application switch between fullscreened windows on Windows is a tiny shock, a little blast, of anti-intuition.

Maximising windows should be actively discouraged!

However, for many apps it's pretty easy to make the window nice and large very quickly, so there is little functionality that is lost - it just promotes better use.

Personally I think Windows' developers and users penchant for fullscreening apps smacks of 1970's style applications which were based on different 'screens' of information. It's 2008 now, it's time we made more judicial use of full-screen apps."

"As a man watching that video was an eye opener, but I think I can explain some of the hostility that men have towards the subject.

For the record I haven't ever cat called anyone, although I have been catcalled myself a couple of times by women and it didn't bother me, but it absolutely would if I experienced it to the degree the woman in the video did.

Now when it comes to the hostility, I think a lot of men don't like that all of their interactions with female strangers are colored by the assumption that we are hitting on them and/or that we are dangerous.

Being a ""hard"" looking man, it can be dehumanizing when walking down the street and suddenly a woman starts looking over her shoulder and acting like you're a potential rapist. It also sucks that I can't strike up a conversation or compliment a woman without her being on guard that I'm hitting on her and/or that I'm a pervert.

Also when it actually comes to approaching women because you are single and want a date, people have such wide opinions on what is and is not appropriate. NOTHING was appropriate about the guys in that video, but what is appropriate? Is it appropriate to strike up a conversation with a woman in a park while you're walking your dog, and if it goes well and she seems receptive ask for a number? Some people would call this creepy and some people would say it's not. 

Also, a lot of people would call this creepy if the guy is unattractive but not if he's handsome and well spoken. So it's not just about actions, but about how someone perceives you. Similarly I'm sure the woman in the video would react differently to someone in a suit and tie than someone who is dressed very casually. I'm not trying to demonize women but their interactions and assumptions about men based on their dress and attractiveness are just as prevalent and real as the rest of our biases in society based on appearances are.

Basically the frustration and hostility from men around this concept boils down to us having the onus to be the proactive gender when it comes to dating but at the same time having this stigma where we can be presumed to be dangerous, perverted, or single minded by the women we come across, whether we are actually trying to hit on them or just going about our business and interacting with them."

That's a fair argument, but they can do micro-jumps. It's not well-defined how far they can go per jump, but they can use them. Also, they could use probes to make at least rudimentary lanes, which would be slow, but probably faster than the micro-jumps. The point is that they wouldn't be completely useless.

"When I say the majesty of the universe I don't mean some pie in the sky idea where I just think the world is swell ergo god. I have tried to reason this out and consider the incredible complexity of existence, the fact that there are hundreds of millions of galaxies and hundreds of millions of stars in each one, the sheer scale of everything, from the farthest reaches of the universe to the smallest atomic particles, and most important of all the very fabric of existence, physical and mathematical properties. What reason is there for things to exist? Wouldn't it be just as easy for there to be nothing at all? But somehow all of these principles came into being and led to the development of sentience. I like to think of the quote ""you are the universe experiencing itself."" Those types of ideas make it hard for me to believe that everything just suddenly was. There seems to be too much purpose and order to it all. I'm not trying to argue for intelligent design in the classical sense. Rather, I am saying it seems unlikely to me that a universe with physical properties such as our own could exist without something that brought it into being. I have no idea what the nature of that something is, but I know it has to be there. 

As I stated I consider myself a panentheist such that there isn't the distinction between God and the physical universe we like to imagine. I don't really believe in an anthropomorphized God, I think it is so much further beyond the realm of our understanding than that, and interpenetrates every part of the universe and extends beyond it. That seems most likely to me, and in a more subjective romantic sense I feel an emotional connection. I understand the atheist arguments that dismiss such a connection but to me there is something compelling about consciousness arising out of incredible randomness that makes me place some stock in our feelings. I can't really explain this aspect of it very well because it gets more into mysticism, but I consider the foundations of my belief are grounded in reason, and then my experience of that belief extends into the mystical."
"> I wish someone would just destroy the US so the world would be rid of it"" or ""Americans are the scum of the Earth and should all be sterilized""

I have never seen this uttered by anyone I know, and I didn't have to think very long about your question to have comments of my own. If there is any dehumanization going on, it's definitely targeted at the rural south of the United States. The vast majority of people are that way, at least those that follow U.S politics. Most people know there is a culture war going on. It's been going on since the 60s.

It's actually not fun at all to ""hate"" Americans (though again, I wouldn't conflate criticism with hatred, I think they often do get confused with each other), it fucking sucks. Because largely, the world still aspires to the promise of personal liberty and democracy, which is the bedrock the United States built itself on. It feels like a betrayal, to see the States act the way they do today (and largely have since the cold war), which is probably why there is so much vehement dislike for the U.S.

I agree with you that is it wrong and unhelpful to equate the individual with the actions of the state, and there are definitely people who have a real hard time at that part. They are called bigots. But if you really believe the anti-Americanism was just as bad as under Obama... I mean.. really? When Obama gave a speech here in Canada, in the house of commons, he got a standing ovation from every single MP in that room.

">No. I'm criticizing the delivery as too confrontational. The word doesn't describe what you say but how you say it.

I asked for the full picture because it appears that I am only looking at a small percentage of liberals. Apparently, not all liberals are the way I describe, so I was asking for your input.

>and it really isn't enjoyable when you repeatedly misrepresent what I say and assign arguments to me that I never made. It's funny that you are doing that though because of of where this conversation started.

You say I'm misrepresenting you, but you're not correcting me. Am I supposed to read your mind and figure out what you really mean? That's a feat in which I have yet to have success.

>Your first use of the word 'radical' in this exchange was after I posted that link. You've used it 35 times since. It isn't a coincidence that you hadn't used it before.

You think I wasn't arguing about radical leftists in the first place when the content of the first comment you responded to was 50% mocking leftists. I was accused of cherry-picking and apparently I ""misrepresent"" how certain sides argue their points or I ""misrepresent"" their points in general. My initial premise was that people on the left do things that I would consider to be radical (apparently I was ""seeing the worst of the worst and being made to believe it's an entire half of the country""). The ""radical nature of the left"" talking point existed in the initial comment. Maybe it's my fault for not making it clearer. It's entirely relevant because it's the premise of this entire discussion. Am I misrepresenting the left or do radicals on the left exist? Am I misrepresenting the amount of radicals? Are my misrepresentations of the left the root cause of my belief that radicals exist? You say I'm misrepresenting the left. In what way? How so?

>Do you think there might be one non violent demonstration, that didn't devolve into riots and destruction of property, somewhere in that list? Do you think there have been 2000+ BLM riots?

Again, Ferguson. Charlottesville. The only ones I really cared about at that point in time were the most severe BLM demonstrations. Just because they may be far-and-few does not mean they are insignificant. It does not make BLM any better. Those events tarnish their reputation. The Civil Rights Movement of the 60-70's didn't need to use violence. In fact, non-violence was in their principles for protesting. Sure, there might have been many more protests that didn't exactly destroy property and burn cities to the ground, but the ones I responded to support my idea that BLM is still all of what I had described it to be. You quoted me, so I'll quote me:

>""BLM demonstrators are violent and obnoxious.""

Are they not? From what I see on their signs, I can say that they are obnoxious. Are they violent? Maybe not all the time, but they sure are hostile.

>""They hold tons of disdain toward white people during their little riots.""

Do they not? ""White Silence = Violence,"" was something I saw on one of the ones you linked. If I just look at images of BLM protests, I can see some signs that say ""Cops, pigs, murderers,"" ""Violence begets violence,"" ""Blue lives don't matter,"" and so on. I should have added ""and police"" in that quote. From what I've seen, this hate is unfounded. Most of it is just in spite of cops shooting unarmed black people because they were unarmed even though they could still be legally shot if they do something that can justify a shot.

>""They actively defy the authority of the police because they are police officers.""

Do they not? ""No justice, no peace,"" ""Fuck the police."" 

>""They destroy the property of white people and police.""

Do they not? 

>""Tell me of one demonstration that has not gone this way in response to a cop killing an unarmed black person.""

A hostile protest to any degree can be seen in response to any time a police officer kills a black person if they are unarmed, especially if the officer is white. Does it not? I have not seen a completely peaceful or primarily non-hostile protest in response to a cop killing an unarmed black person. Can you show me a peaceful protest or a boycott or something that doesn't involve screaming in people's faces, holding provocative signs, obstructing the roads and the lives of others, being closed to all types of discussion, swearing, and so on, in response to an unarmed black person being shot by a police officer, as this had initially requested?

Most of those 2000, I'll bet, don't even involve a shooting at all. Talk about misrepresenting arguments. You nitpicked ""BLM"" ""IS"" and ""VIOLENT"" and challenged me to show that all or most of the 2000 cases were violent in nature. Am I wrong in any of what I've said?

>I even quoted the part I was responding to. So when you started going through the list and saying irrelevant bollocks like ""someone shouts ""fuck the police."" Very peaceful and respectable,"" you should have known you were pivoting. 

I responded to show that they aren't goody-goody two shoes and matching socks. You keep saying that I'm ""pivoting,"" but that implies I'm going away from the topic that was initially presented. As I've shown before, everything I've said has been relevant. You're nitpicking.

>The first thing I said to you was that I didn't understand what you were trying to prove with all those links.

And I said ""I'm trying to show that they [radical leftists] exist, therefore they matter.""

>They weren't relevant to the conversation. Nobody said these things didn't exist. Your response didn't address the arguments made in the comment you were replying to.

But the counter-argument that was presented to me was that I am ""misrepresenting the left"" as a whole and boiling them down to a radical movement. The left is supposedly not entirely the way I describe (the way I define ""radical""). I gave examples to show how common ""radicals"" are in mainstream politics, especially social justice (the movement with what I'd call the highest radical prevalence). The comment I had responded to implied that any mention of a radical leftist is ""cherry picking"" and thus not a valid argument against the left. To be considered ""cherry picking,"" there needs to be a lack of a substantial amount of significant evidence to support the premise. I proved otherwise. That was the purpose of all of the citations.

If you didn't see that, that is not my problem.

>You opened with ""Cherry picking?"" so you were definitely aware of this at the very least.

I was refuting the argument that Shapiro ""cherry picks"" information. Which was why that entire section of links exists. Again, to be ""cherry picking,"" there needs to be a lack of a substantial amount of significant evidence of something. I showed the abundance of cases that ought to show that Shapiro was not ""cherry picking."" 

>Nothing that followed addressed the idea of Shapiro cherry picking.

Are you saying that he does? To me, this statement implies that he does cherry-pick and I was supposed to defend his cherry picking instead of what I had actually done.

>""As you can see, this is a real thing. It's not some figment of our imagination"" isn't a rebuttal to ""Shapiro cherry picks"".

It might not be, but everything above the line above that particular statement challenges the claim that he does indeed ""cherry pick."" To have truly been ""cherry picking,"" it would need to be the equivalent of citing to a study that shows that vaccines cause autism among a sea of studies that shows that it doesn't. In this case, it is claimed that Shapiro picks the bottom 1% of occurrences to attack and then he applies it to the whole of the left. My research suggests that there exists a significant portion of the left that is accurately represented by Shapiro's arguments and counterarguments, especially when it comes to social justice.

>""Finding a stupid political journalist on Twitter is easy"" was an admission that you can find people saying dumb things easily. I don't think they were arguing that nobody says these things at all.

Again, it wasn't on Twitter or Tumblr or anything else. It was actual media sources. I am supposedly ""misrepresenting the left"" if I criticize ideas that come from those sources. It's supposedly ""cherry picking"" when Shapiro does it. Why is it wrong for me or Shapiro to claim certain things if nobody disagrees that they exist? This seems like a pointless attack on my argument.

>You're kind of just supporting their point that Shapiro misrepresents the left. Your comments on the wage gap in particular show that you don't quite have the full picture.

"> Outlets must be set as implicitly unwrapped optionals.

This is simply not correct. Try setting a standard optional IBOutlet, it will work fine. What will not work is setting a non-optional property because it will not be initialized at the object's init. But IBOutlets are optionals - and you're absolutely right in that standardly IBOutlets can safely be set as implicitly unwrapped because as long as we -awakeFromNib and the outlet is connected, we're sure that it's non-nil for now.

Moreover, an implicitly unwrapped optional is still an optional. They can undergo all the standard safety checks that optionals can, including if-let syntax (NB: this cannot be done with a non-optional!). They are not two different beasts, they are a slightly different way to use an optional object. Your car analogy doesn't really apply.

As to why you would check against nil on an outlet? You really don't have to look far to come up with some sort of example. Consider the following scenario: I have a custom view with a dataSource delegate (similar to UITableViewDataSource) and while there is a default data source at -awakeFromNib, this data source may change - or perhaps even be nil in the future. Here, it would be unwise to use an implicitly unwrapped optional because we know that this outlet may change at runtime.

Not to mention the fact that you may want to use optionals for your outlets just for style sake because implicitly unwrapped optionals are not strictly-speaking ""safe""."

You spent all that time and effort explaining how it's possible to be a nihilist and an activist, (which I never claimed was impossible), but I can't find anything in that text wall that explains how this position could ever hope to achieve a stable, free, fair, and functioning anarchist society. I mean, who cares whether morality/ideology/whatever is external or internal? Isn't the more relevant question whether or not it's necessary?

I understand that everyone is driven by personal emotions to some degree. That doesn't change the fact that, without an ideology/morality that's based in reason and held above personal emotions, there's no social mechanism to keep this nihilist utopia standing. Okay, so you're an altruist because it makes you feel good, that's fine. What about everyone else? What if, one day, a shitload of people decided that they didn't want to be altruists anymore and that giving to the poor made them unhappy? What are you going to do to prevent things from regressing back into oppression and inequality if, every time you confront these greedy assholes, they just say ""hey, this makes me feel good and your morality is no better or worse than mine.""

"Actually I disagree- Braeden has worked on a number of shows over the decades... and yes, even where he was famous enough to play himself.

NPH is a great guy- I like all sorts of things about him- but honestly, I thought Braeden was the grown-up in this, and showed a younger man what and older man already knows well.

Consider this- Braeden is a 'no-name' to most of you - and yet he's still working after 30 years in the business. How many other actors are in his shoes after that amount of time? In fact, NPH wanted him on the show, which should say something.

NPH is going to remembered, so everyone can get their panties out of a twist, but Braeden made a great point- he's still working where most of the people he worked with 30 years ago are long since gone. And he deserves some respect for that, something NPH simply didn't do."

"> things like opening doors for women and putting their coats on for them spring directly from a world view in which women are delicate little flowers who can't do such things for themselves.

I don't think men ever viewed women as too weak to put on their own coats, I think it was just expected that men be a little kinder to women. The fairer sex and all that. Maybe some of the things, like lifting heavy objects came from the supposition that women were weaker, but generally speaking, in many cases, women do not posses the same level of upper body strength as men, it is just physiological; just as men do not possess the ability to produce breastmilk.

> You are being treated differently because of your sex. If you think chivalry means being nice to women, then okay I'm all for it. If you think it means treating women differently, then you have to think about why exactly women are being treated differently.

Being treated differently because of your sex is just common sense. It will always happen. Women will get maternity leave, not men. Women should get breaks at work to breastpump if they have recently had a child and choose to do so, not men. Men will always be more sought after for laborious tasks, not women. You look at people as if there is absolutely no difference between the sexes - there are countless differences between us. 

> If you're dating a dude and you like it when he does shit for you, that's fine. The problem is with the idea that all women should be treated like that by all men.

Why is this a problem? What negative would come from men being nicer to women?

> If a drunk person randomly assaults me... if they follow me I'll find a cop. 

I don't know if you know what assault is. Not groping, not bumping or shoving, but assault? If someone got rowdy enough and you were in the wrong place at the wrong time, you couldn't do any of these, you'd either haul ass or stand your ground.


>She's obviously no weaker or less aggressive than I am, so why exactly shouldn't I?


There is absolutely nothing obvious about her strength. She could be much weaker than you. Just because a woman is drunk or on a substance doesn't make her any stronger, it could just make her think that she is, or just more of an asshole.

> last time I played D&D the woman who sits across from me rolled the same number as I on a search check and I squealed and giggled while she went in for a fist bump.

I would venture to guess here that you are speaking of someone you know, or a friend of a friend. That is an entirely different scenario than the one I was using as an example. If you were out at a bar with people you never met around you, you have zero idea how anyone would react to anything, but it is a safe bet if you touch a guy they will care infinitely less than if you touch a woman in the exact same way. (A shoulder push was the only way I could think to describe grabbing someone's shoulder and giving it a bit of a shake, sometimes following or followed by a pat on the back.)

> Not everyone socializes the same way you do.

Completely agree with this. But not everyone socializes like you either. And when you are in certain situations you have to read everyone and everything as much and as well as you can. From my experience men and women are extraordinarily different and react in completely opposing manners very often.

I am not at all saying that women are lesser individuals than men, I am just saying that accepting we are different in so many ways, embracing it, and helping each other would be a great thing. We all have strengths and weaknesses, use them to assist someone who could use your strengths, there is nothing wrong with that.

I am also not saying to treat men like crap, but being kind to a woman for being a woman isn't really a bad thing. I have no idea why so many people hate on being nice to someone for any specific reason. I go out of my way to help some old person at the grocery store that can't reach something specifically because they are old... is that terrible of me? Is that discriminatory since I didn't help the 25 year old next to him reach something? We all treat each other certain ways based on how we read the other person, if we help them because of that ""reading"" then who the hell cares?

"I think that's a pretty charged way to look at things. I think it would be an accurate depiction of what would happen if crazy radical Tumblr ""feminists"" actually had institutional power, but they have virtually none, and their actions toward their brand of feminism are reserved predominantly to ""kill all men"" rants on Tumblr and walking into people on the street (I guess you could toss false rape accusations in here too, but I don't think these necessarily align here).

The point being, most people who identify as feminists in the real world, not the crazy Tumblr world/gender studies major world, are gender egalitarians, and think feminism is synonymous with gender egalitarianism. But if you look predominantly in working environments, which is where people spend most of their waking hours and is a major linkage with social status, sexism seems to have a more negative effect on women both presently and especially historically. So the movement for gender egalitarianism HAD to start with basically only things for women because they were second class citizens, (like couldn't vote until the 1920s), which is why that movement was originally termed feminism. Assholes have co opted that term to mean something different but the origin of the term is more out of necessity for equality."
"I think people become really elitist / snobby to justify their own choices in life and in this case, diet. IMO people just like to feel better than others, and seeing people who don't follow what they do might feel like an attack on their own personal choices in life.

Some people tried vegan and find that they didn't enjoy it, while others really like how they feel on a vegan diet. I think if people can just mind their own business and leave other people to make their own choices, then life would be better."

> My personal feelings don't have any sway here, but my main issue with Support aren't the weapons, but rather that I don't really have that much of a role in combat besides the occasional resupply that someone actually needs.

I feel the same. ""Support"" doesn't feel so ""support"" more than it feels ""here's an ammo kit and some explosives; do whatever.""

> that they're not afraid of changing what are considered core mechanics to make the game different.

This particular point is probably what's causing this discussion to continue for so long. You like the idea of these changes because it keeps things fresh (probably not wholly accurate), but I'd argue then why not make a new game instead of changing such core things of this game? Ammo 2.0, with some tweaks, could be a great mechanic in another game by DICE but I, and others, want ""Battlefield"" to remain the same at its core. I just don't think such a drastic change to what has been an aspect of the game since gadgets were introduced would feel ""right."" You can argue as much as you want about game balance vs. ""feeling right"" but at the end of the day the ""feel"" that people get from the game is still important.

> With two AT grenades, a light AT grenade, and a single AT rocket, you could almost bring down a tank on your own.

Just want to point out it's typically more effective to do two AT Grenades and two AT Rockets to the side, skipping the Light AT Grenade altogether in favor of reloading the rocket gun a tad bit faster; but I digress. 

> To me, that means Assaults are a little too powerful. It's also an attempt at changing squad compositions. A dedicating tank-hunting squad should be more powerful mixing Assaults and Supports instead of just a bunch of Assaults.

Yet again this is where our opinions deviate. I feel the opposite as you can still have a good sense of teamwork even with a squad full of Assault players trying to tackle a tank. The same could be said, pre-patch, of a mixed squad too. It's not all about class interaction (Ammo Bags resupplying Assaults better does not necessarily mean better teamwork), it's also about what you do with the class too. 

> What this does is put more emphasis on gunplay and less on positioning, which BF1 is trying to avoid. 

I think there should be a good balance between both instead of focusing so much on positioning. Gun skill should compensate at least somewhat for a lack of good positioning, and vise versa, in my opinion. Ever since BF3's suppression patch it's felt like no matter how good you are with a Sniper if you start getting suppressed you're literally useless, and I fucking hate that feeling. It's why even though I love Scout/Recon, I hardly ever play them unless my team needs Flare support, for example."

Voters have extremely short memories, and they'll quickly forget all the crazy shit he's said/done when he's up there saying things that make sense to them as voters. For instance, he released his healthcare plan today that includes getting rid of ACA and increasing global competition for pharmaceuticals, which Republican voters especially can get behind. Not only that, but he will be EXTREMELY successful in getting people to vote against Hillary because of the amount of baggage she comes with. I think Democratic voters don't really care about her baggage (thus her doing so well in the Primaries), but emboldening Republican voters against her will be equally important for him."

In what world would that be an appropriate response for a man to do to a woman? In what world would any of this be okay? That world would be a pretty fucked up place to live in.

Tongue firmly in cheek.

>But but :'((((

>lol you don't agree, yet you say For me, it is more like “I do not like this message because of the way they packaged it” if you know what I mean.

You really don't see the distinction? lol.

Remember, intent is important.

One is trying to send a message. The other is trying to raise money for charity. 

If I want to ""send a message"" that murder is wrong, I don't go killing people i.e. doing the thing I think is wrong to show that it is indeed wrong. The Blurred lines video was trying to send the message that sexually objectifying women was wrong by sexually objectifying men. That was my criticism.

If I want to raise money for a good cause? I'd definitely be down with “sucking dicks for prostrate cancer.” Why not motorboating for breast cancer?

>But don't attach breast cancer awareness to it.

>You don't see a problem with that? Why aren't we teaching women that to attract a good man you should be healthy and smart and kind and funny? When you focus on one part of the equation, there are going to be shortcomings in the others.

>Some women look prettier with makeup, not all. 

Doesn't change the fact that when women wear it, it's because they think it will make them more attractive.

>I like the confidence I get when I wear what I wear, but I don't like the vast, vast majority of the attention I get from men for noticing those things.

I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one. 

The reason you feel more confident is because you know you appear more attractive -- there's nothing inherent about putting on a mask that makes someone more confident. 

>I'm talking more about ""I make 400k a year working on Wall Street and live on 5th Ave. Want to come back to my place?"" 

I mean, is that really more of a lie than the woman who wears high heels, a push up bra, and massive globs of makeup? To me, they're the same thing. One is lying about how you look, the other about how much you're worth. If intent is really important as you say, then it's more important that we know why the guy says he makes 400k. Is it because he's trying to deceive her into sleeping with him? Or could it be because he wants to feel emotionally connected to someone but feels like he can't get in the door with his real paycheck? Or because he wants to feel validated, like he's worth something?

>I wouldn't say never, but certainly in most. This is why you get to know people and eventually trust them. 

Ultimately, you're still relying on guesswork, on feelings and the limited evidence you have. There's no ""hard proof"" of someone's intent unless you get inside his/her head at the moment of the action.

Most anti-social justice types incessantly mock PTSD triggers. To co opt the concept so it can be turned around on some shitty thing an SRSer said is really crappy. It's just a crappy thing to do. Does that particular person normally mock PTSD triggers? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. I hope I am; but I think it's a fair assumption in this case. If a community almost ubiquitously denies the legitimacy of PTSD triggers, it's really really shitty to co opt the struggles of PTSD stricken soldiers to stick it to some douches on an internet forum.

Just because you can think up a scenario where lump sum would have a better return, doesn’t make it mathematically superior. I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not, but investing $10,000 over the course of a year vs $10,000 when you first hear about Bitcoin (and are probably having serious FOMO) is definitively a lower risk strategy. If somebody believes in Bitcoin/Blockchain as a technology and they’re planning on holding for the long run then advising against DCA isn’t doing them any favors.

"Oh man, thanks for your response, much better than the other guy. Still wrong though. 

First up, You seem to be making claims about my character and life based on a simple comment. I feel great on a day to day basis, life is good!

2nd, it does make sense. My argument was that as i understand it, the person i would debate on shooting (The westboro baptist) would cause nothing but pain and misery to others in their life. 

3rd, i was referring to a chance they may leave the westboro baptists for another life.

4th, I argue that killing a random person is not intrinsically a bad thing. Innocent or no. I have come to the conclusion that self interest is all that matters, if I could live a vastly better life by doing this and live happily with myself, why wouldn't I? 

5th, I say sure as a filler.

6th, Well Today I learnt. Equally, there is no blame to place, so it is all misguided. I'll let you worry about ""good reason"". That seems subjective, your bar is set much higher than mine it seems. 

7th, Nice ad hominem, real mature buddy. Also, I'm not arguing from a point of morality, purely self interest. It would seem that shooting someone who I deem to be a terrible person for the good of myself is great. its not that i ""lack the courage"", its that it'd negatively impact me, through guilt. Shooting someone that would not yield the same guilt, is a different case.

8th, Wrong. Killing an innocent person to save the entire human race is a moral action. Moral absolutes are retarded.

9th, How is it that you have decided i would NOT kill Hitler? Because i can assure you if i could go back in time, be given a gun in a room alone with Hitler, i would without a doubt shoot him. Simple stuff. 

10th, great quote, i like it. I was talking about moral absolutes being the white and black. Nothing is intrinsically right or wrong, its all relative to the situation.

11th, Shame we aren't friends buddy, I'm a nice guy. What else could good and bad mean? Well I don't know man. Anything. It's all relative. Im sure the radical islamists thought blowing up the twin towers was a great act of morality. And others don't. So who is right? There is no one conception of good and bad. Why do I have to accept your form of morality? Why would i care for the well being of other creatures? Hell I care about myself, my friends and my family. This doesn't mean I don't care for the layman. I just care less. Animals too, surely we are willfully causing harm to those conscious creatures? But we do it anyways, because out self interest overrides that of the animals. Same applies here. My self interest overrides that of the person i choose to shoot.

What stops the world degenerating into a murderspree? Well its not in peoples self interest to cause anarchy, is it? Why would they? they have no reason to. 

You're right about ""dont kill innocent people"", its a good law, but is it a moral absolute? No. 

12th, You're right! I don't have targets, but i'm speaking in hypothetics, do try to keep up. Weak and impotent degenerate? Kind words, and nice Ad Hominem, last time i checked that was SUPER relevant. 

13th, Suppose I am prejudice in this case, it doesn't mean im wrong however. Prejudices can often be correct. 

14th, I could accept my cowardice, if i was one.

Great points, but your arguments were severely weakened by your tone. Try to improve that. I'll give you a C+.

You say you were a conscript from which country? Did you experience war?or was it just training exercises? Which make you the master of infantry tactics.

I was never talking about in the event of a full scale armed attack on a royal property.i was talking about a member of the public assaulting a guardsman on sentry, in which case everything i have said is correct it is in part 1 orders.

And just for your information, in the event of being shot at while on sentry, as i stated, you have no ammunition,all you could do is find cover, which if at the palace there is none, and wait for a reaction force from the guardroom to be deployed, which again i previously stated. And another one for you, even if someone is armed you need to fire 3 warning shots before you can fire on them unless you are 100% sure if you do not fire on them they will kill a royal.

You have not called me out on any bullshit, everything i have said is true you are an outsider with no experience other than what you have read on the internet who has no clue, but keep playing call of duty and ""learning your military tactics"" im sure they will help you in real life should you ever have to experience it"

"> Oh, you sweet summer child

You may want to save the condescension for a scenario when you're actually right. I can't believe I need to explain this again - but here you go:

>And tells Catelyn that it was his dagger but was lost to Tyrion as a tourney wager on Joffrey's nameday

Right. He's lying. 

In A Clash of Kings, Catelyn found out that Littlefinger lied to her about the dagger only after she interrogated Jaime Lannister. Jaime bluntly admitted that he pushed Bran from the window in attempt to kill him, but claimed that neither he nor Cersei nor Tyrion had anything to do with the assassin; both Tyrion and Jaime pointed out the key flaw in Littlefinger's story- Tyrion couldn't have won the dagger in a gambling bet because he never betted against Jaime in such circumstances. When asked about the dagger, Jaime remembered that Littlefinger bet and lost it - to Robert, not to Tyrion. Catelyn realized Jaime was telling her the truth, for he had nothing to gain by lying about the assassin and the dagger after admitting that he pushed Bran. Jaime admits that he and Cersei considered having Bran killed, but given the fact Catelyn was in his bed chamber at all times and the room was guarded, it would have meant murdering their way through half of Winterfell's population to reach Bran, and they concluded there was no need when it seemed more likely that Bran would die of his injuries from the fall.

>We know this is his overall plan, to sow discord and get the two families fighting. This serves that.

You're completely missing the fact that he accomplishes this without having sent the assassin. That's the brilliance of Littlefinger. Once he sees that his old dagger was used, he capitalizes on what he's already done to sow discord between the Starks and the Lannisters when he has Lysa send the raven to Winterfell. He implicates Tyrion in Bran's attempted murder and sets Catelyn on a collision course to kidnapping him and taking him to the Eyrie. He didn't need to send the catspaw to benefit from the situation, you are attributing more to him than the writer intends.

See that's the real tragedy here - that GRRM has created one of many whodunnits in the books - which follows a similar arc of initially making us think it's one person who did it, and then revealing a book or two later who really did (Jon Arryn's Murder - Jaime & Cersei, when it's Littlefinger and Lysa; Joffrey's Murder - Tyrion, when it's Olenna & Littlefinger; Bran, Tyrion, when it's Joffrey) and you don't even appreciate it. You think Joffrey is the red herring - no, the red herring was Tyrion, which was given to us initially by Littlefinger.

Your need to attribute this to Littlefinger relies on some massive leaps of logic.

>Doesn't need to be in Winterfell because he has spies everywhere

Oh yeah? Littlefinger has spies in the North? Since when?

See how you need Littlefinger to be omniscient in order for him to fit the bill? Why not just say it was Bloodraven? 

So Littlefinger is not in Winterfell 

Has no idea about Bran, or his condition 

Has no motive to hurt Bran, as his plan to sow discord is already in effect 

Lies to Catelyn about the ownership of the dagger, has no access to the dagger, as it now belongs to Robert (during said events), 

Puts Catelyn in mortal danger by not giving the assassin special instructions regarding her safety (you know, since he knows Bran was pushed, he knows Bran saw Jaime and Cersei, he knows they have motive to push him... cause of the spies) 

How would Littlefinger communicate with a petty catspaw? Raven? (Impossible: How could a raven be trained to fly to a catspaw pussyfooting around and living in the stables, and moreover how could the catspaw read the message?)

And finally, he doesn't even need to be the guy because he benefits from the situation without being the guy.

The real answer, is the one that we see unfold over three books, across multiple POVs, figured out by Jaime and Tyrion (who both know Joffrey far better than you or I), and hinted to in ACoK and outright spoon fed to us finally in ASoS by a preponderance of the evidence:

Joffrey
----------------------------------------------

Just for reference, here's that evidence, so we can put this to rest finally:

MOTIVE
----------------------------------------------

>“Yes, I hoped the boy would die. So did you. Even Robert thought that would have been for the best. ‘We kill our horses when they break a leg, and our dogs when they go blind, but we are too weak to give the same mercy to crippled children,’ he told me. He was blind himself at the time, from drink.”

>Robert? Jaime had guarded the king long enough to know that Robert Baratheon said things in his cups that he would have denied angrily the next day. “Were you alone when Robert said this?”

>“You don’t think he said it to Ned Stark, I hope? Of course we were alone. Us and the children.” 

>Cersei removed her hairnet and draped it over a bedpost, then shook out her golden curls. “Perhaps Myrcella sent this man with the dagger, do you think so?”

>“Not Myrcella. Joffrey.”

>Cersei frowned. “Joffrey had no love for Robb Stark, but the younger boy was nothing to him. He was only a child himself.”

>“A child hungry for a pat on the head from that sot you let him believe was his father.”


MEANS
----------------------------------

>but that dagger did change hands, I recall it now. Robert showed it to me that night at the feast. His Grace loved to salt my wounds, especially when drunk. (ACOK)

The knife was Robert's at the time, LF lied about Tyrion winning it from him. 

OPPORTUNITY
-----------------------------------

He takes the dagger from Robert's baggage train fully knowing that Robert only uses the knife Jon Arryn got him when he grew up in the Eyrie. He has both access and authority to do so. The conspicuousness of the dagger is indicator of stupidity of this move. The dagger is recognizable and has history of ownership.

>I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadn’t he? Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger’s knife. (Tyrion, ASOS)

Even The Citadel, at Westeros .org gives this answer: Source

>5.1. WHO TRIED TO KILL BRAN?
Evidence revealed in A Storm of Swords points squarely at Joffrey as the instigator. At the queen’s breakfast he revealed, ""... I am no stranger to Valyrian steel."" (III: 663) Tyrion, suspicious of that statement, suggests that he will give a Valyrian steel dagger with a dragonbone hilt as a gift to Joffrey. Joffrey’s reply is awkward: ""Joff gave him a sharp look. ‘You ... yes, a dagger to match my sword, good.’ He nodded. ‘A ... a gold hilt with rubies in it. Dragonbone is too plain.’"" (III: 664) Finally, Jaime questions Cersei about the attempt on Bran. She reveals that Robert said in Joffrey’s hearing that it’d be a kindness to end the boy’s misery, but that they were all too weak. Jaime concludes that Joffrey, eager for his father’s attention, may have decided to prove that he was capable of doing it (III: 823).

However,

>But that leaves the problem of why Joffrey would choose a flashy dagger or any dagger at all? Why give the assassin a dagger at all?

Because he's an idiot

He should had hired the catspaw to smother him with a pillow, but he didn't, and the idiocy of the crime is another hint at who did it

So, if you prefer to think it was LF, then by all means, continue thinking so. It is, however, with willful ignorance of the truth, which Martin beautifully revealed to us over the course of the first three books. I'll even quote GRRM himself:

>I will tell you that ASOS will resolve the question of Bran and the dagger, and also that of Jon Arryn's killer. 

SSM

So.. there you go. From the horses mouth. It was Joffrey.

>Oh, you sweet summer child.

Again, thanks for that.

"I totally agree. The Democratic Party has to appreciate that Trump's victory represents a dramatic sea change in US politics. We are entering a period of deglobalization, where nativist sentiment is rising, while technology erodes the power & trust that citizens have in civic institutions. It is sadly, likely a both post-truth & post-liberal era too.

The old Southern Strategy of Nixon and the later FOX correction of ""liberal media bias"" has now been transformed thru social media into a white-nativist-media bubble strategy. Democrats should realize that while voters in WI or PA don't consciously identify with white identity politics now, they could be persuaded to. We have to be aware that the new alt-right outrage machines have made describing racism or pointing out racism, ""racist"". 

Practically, this means Democrats need to begin distancing themselves from BLM and other causes and perhaps using a different set of terms to describe social justice, increasing the profile of white Rust Belt politicians, while invoking a set of feel-good patriotic slogans about civic duty.

Also, you say that a strong sexual bond and compatibility is important to the long-term viability of marriage, but without premarital sex and cohabitation, that's practically impossible to find out, and it sounds like you don't care about chastity in a man, only a woman. It's actually the case for both men and women that the more casual sex they've had, the less likely they are to remain sexually faithful.

Yes, there are plenty of ex-pats who find wives abroad, or who have married women who come from abroad. But trying to find a wife like she's a piece of statistic sounds really off-putting to me personally. My approach to finding a life partner was to improve MYSELF as much as I could, so that I could be the best potential wife and mother I could be. As a result, I attracted an awesome man who is the best husband and father.

As for the courts, welfare and food stamps, I think that's preferable to abused women at home, starving children in the streets, human trafficking, and other horrible things that happen in ""more traditional"" countries. But I do understand from those women's perspective that it would be great to find a Western man who is not going to beat her up constantly and always cheat on her with prostitutes and infect her with diseases, etc. I grew up in a very patriarchal society and was told that I was worthless because I was a girl, and that I should have been aborted, so I know a bit of this first hand.

You making a pregnant character and having fun with the different roleplaying challenges is 100% fine and im sure was a different experience. But you had that in mind at characyer creation, you wanted that character to start pregnant.

You werent playing an elf who could choose their sex every day, and one session decide ""you know what, i want to see what its like to be pregnant!"" I change my sex to female and i go find my lover so he can knock me up!! Like its some sort of.... Quest.

So to the general public, nursing is seen as a well respected field. To many people who practice medicine (physicians. Nurses don't practice medicine), we are seen as a joke. I've had many doctors tell me that they cannot respect the nurses who work on the general medicine floors because of how ignorant they are with absolutely no critical thinking skills.

People taking offense doesn't place affirmative duty on you to police your speech, it only puts that affirmative duty on you if you care what people think or say about you.

To be honest, though, I'm not sure why getting labeled a misogynist or sexist is that concerning to you. 

I'm a recovering sexist and that comes from the underlying misogyny in our culture that I haven't noticed yet. I work very hard not to be sexist or misogynistic, but sometimes I still say something that belies my ignorance. The correct response in this case is humility and apology, rather than bluster and excuses.

You say that a person who takes excessive offense is a social nuisance, and I agree with you. There are people who would rather put people down just so that they can seem superior to them. They want to show that they have a better understanding of how things should work. Just because there are people like this it doesn't take away from the real pain that the very same actions could cause other people. It makes me wonder if your experience with people is mostly of the latter camp, rather than people who are genuinely upset about these issues.

I promise you they exist. I promise you there are a lot of them. And I promise you that if they could just ""help but be offended"" they would choose to do that. It doesn't really work that way, though."

">A more apt comparison

The point of comparison is that the reasons things were designed isn't really important to how things are used. Especially when we talk about language, most of words you use meant something different in the past, including the word 'nigger' which had no demeaning connotations 500 years ago. I don't even understand what it means to ""design a word nigger"", but I just rolled with it, assuming he meant that people gave it a new meaning.

>That's the point, though, that's what they're for.

Language changes and people are the force behind it. It was, now it isn't. Because I and people I speak to collectively decided so.

Maybe in your speech it is what they are for. It doesn't mean your langauge is the right one. The same way RP, GA or AAVE is not the right one.

On /r/books today there's a raging discussion about Anne Rice's blog post complaining about political correctness in publishing. SJWs accuse writers, including Rice, of all kinds of things when they write novels with a protaganist or antagonist of a different race or gender from their own complaining that the writer is ""misappropriating (someone's) voice"" or whatever PC crap term they use to describe it. Rice complains of ""censorship"" (of course it's not really censorship) and threats. But this is what you think male writers should be doing more of.

"Your examples are nice, but can also cause the opposite reaction, so I don't see them as being unqualified successes. 

>The person knows that everyone deserves equal treatment

In which way? Everyone should be insulted? Everyone should be treated with kindness? To me, if you know someone is a non-believer, it's better NOT to try to wrangle them into your beliefs by saying, ""I'll pray for you."" In the rare best case, it might inspire them to listen. In most cases, you're rubbing the non-believer wrong (just a little, but still being a tad impolite)... because they don't share your belief that prayer is a GOOD thing. To them, it's a waste of time, and presumptuous besides. You're basically saying, ""Oh, you lack something I have, so I'll seek supernatural intervention in order to fix you."" Not really polite. And in worst cases, you've (unintentionally or not), just shown them how self-righteous Christians can be. Note, it doesn't matter how you meant it... if you're an atheist and have had this said to you many, many times with clear body language that it's been meant in an insulting way... another time (no matter how well-intentioned) just rubs you wrong. [Understand, this same thing happens all the time to atheists when we tell people we don't believe. That simple statement to many Christians is seen as offensive.] How would you feel if when you said, ""I'll pray for you,"" atheists responded, ""And I'll use reason for you."" See, to an atheist, using reason is a strong value, yet the exchange (though it could be well-meant) comes across somewhat insulting doesn't it? Because it implies that YOU aren't using reason, and the atheist doing it for you might help you learn how... just like ""I'll pray for you"" to an atheist implies that he needs need God, and the believer will help him via prayer. 

>They offer the statement of prayer as a profession of care and equality.

Again, the problem isn't their motives, or even their goals. If they were really being polite, they would consider the beliefs/feelings of the person they are offering it to. Offering to pray for someone means different things to different audiences. Between believers, its a shared cultural expression offered out of love (and known to be offered that way). Between a believer and non-believer, it's not a shared cultural expression, and its often not offered out of love, but as a snide ""I'm better than you evil heathen"" type of comment. The body language and emotion in the words make that clear. Which, unfortunately can create a knee-jerk reaction. Ultimately, being polite usually means doing to someone as they wish, rather than as you wish... which in this case should be to offer the non-believer a good day (which doesn't stop you praying for them in private, but does ensure you don't insult them by presuming).

Take it as you wish, but I'm just trying to explain the other side in response to your comment, ""I've always felt that this line of thinking is offensive to the Christian."" Hopefully you've seen why atheists CAN be insulted when being told, ""I'll pray for you."" We have real life experience where its not meant in good ways (likely far more often than you imagine). That's one of the challenges for really kind people... they have a hard time realizing just how unthinkingly unkind most people can be. "

As for matters such as women praying behind men, I guess that is to protect the dignity of women and keep the men focused on praying, if you know what I mean.


~~Don't quote me on this, but I think when Quran talks to the masculine pronoun (he), it often means both males and females because they are basically the same (Eve was made out of one rib of Adam).~~ Most of the verses in which there are orders, God refers to Muslims in a plural noun. For example: ""Don't pray while you are drunk"". You in this case means a group a people, so it is both male and female.


I have never heard of the necessity of a man having to accompany a woman in the street (in Hajj, yeah, but not in everyday life). Women here in Egypt walk without a brother or a husband to accompany them. I can say that it isn't bad for a woman in case of Hajj, we all know women aren't as strong as men, maybe she gets tired and wants to rest or something, she needs a man to rely on.



Finally, I don't support the FSA, neither Erdogan and any sane human being can agree with me, but sadly, there is a lack of common sense in the middle East region lately (Saudi Arabia and Israel congratulate Trump on attacking Syria, is a good example).

"I lost a much smaller amount of weight (30lbs) and I was never that heavy (at most 180lbs at 5'4), but I can totally relate to how people will treat you differently. 

Attention from men increased tenfold. I began getting hit on very frequently, and what bothered me was that I knew it was only because of my looks, because those same men paid me little attention before the weight loss. 

A weird effect was that I was perceived as being significantly less intelligent by a lot of people. I was my high school's valedictorian. I studied (and taught) chemistry and neuropsychology in college. Now I was being explained simple concepts, mostly by men, as if I couldn't rub two brain cells together. It was frustrating.

It also changed the dynamic of some of my male friendships when they began to see me differently, which put a strain on those friendships. 

Men and women in general were much nicer to me, which I resented a little. When I wasn't their idea of attractive enough, I wasn't worth their time? The customer service I received was like night and day. People world go out of their way to do me favors or be nice. It really makes you feel like your value as a person is rooted in your appearance, and people become more superficial in their interactions with you.

In contrast, my relationships with women also struggled. Where I once got friendly security, I now got strained, cautious interactions. I could tell I was being perceived as a threat rather than a friend. I had to compensate by becoming overly friendly to get women to be friendly back.

Despite this, I'm overall happy with the weight loss. I know I'm healthier and I feel better. I try to treat everyone as if they are worth my time. I would probably not be as empathetic if I hadn't experienced both sides of the coin. I can recognize a shallow relationship when I see one. I wouldn't recommend this experience, but I do hope anyone who reads realizes that everyone has their own struggles, and to try to be a little less judgemental."

You talk as if you can't get soda *and* food with food stamps. I've lived on food stamps before. You can get all the essentials + snacks. Pasta, bread, fruit, and veggies are cheap. So is unprocessed meat. You can make a lot with that, so it's what a lot of people will get. People on food stamps eat a lot of grilled cheese, spaghetti, and soup. 

At the same time, you've got a lot of additional money that doesn't roll over into next month if you don't spend it, and kids like tasty drinks. You can get kool aide, pop, syrup for milk, whatever. 

You talk as if it's an either or sort of thing. It isn't. 

The pish poshing from the more well off never ceases to amaze me. People can't use food stamps on fast food, people can't use food stamps on alcohol or tobacco products, people can't use food stamps on anything that has been precooked. There are a ton of regulations already in place. If parents aren't buying their kids food, its because they are being selfish and that won't change if more regulations are put in place. 

I get about $200 a month to spend on food just for myself. My sister is on WIC and gets food stamps. She gets all her formula paid for, diapers, and other things, and is also able to go out and buy herself essentials to keep herself fed. My mother kept me, my sister, and my brother all fed on food stamps while working a 50+ hour a week job and still not making enough to buy us food otherwise.

Don't fucking talk down on people who have to deal with government assistance for food. 


EDIT: And yeah, some people sell food stamps. It's already illegal, people caught doing it already get punished. What more do you want? The ones who do it and buy drugs instead of feeding their families should have their kids taken away period, any type of change to the system that would 'hurt' them would hurt people that do things the right way. 

Also, keep in mind each state's food stamp program is different. Michigan has one of the better ones in the country. It's extremely easy to get put on it. It offers stamps to the homeless and to mothers with very little checkup required, and more or less as long as you're willing to ask the state for help they *will* help you. I've never met a truly *hungry* family in my home state. I've met people who eat the wrong shit and get malnourished, and I've met people who eat too much bad shit and get fat. Hell, immigrant families here are mostly asian (burmese and vietnamese to be specific) and don't' eat any better than the rest of us. 

If the system needs reform, its in how it is sold to the public. Food stamps are essential for a lot of families who could otherwise not feed themselves, let alone their children. Minimum wage in Michigan is below $10/hr, it is going up but the cost of living has been rising even faster and has been for two decades. More and more people in my age group are being forced to move in together or back in with their parents, at an age where a generation ago people were already starting families and looking to buy homes. My sister had to move back in with my mother with her newborn along with her boyfriend because a taco bell manager's pay wasn't enough for them to rent a place or feed their kid. Food stamps keep my niece and them fed. 

Poor people aren't criminals taking your tax dollars and mis spending them, they're trying to get by. And they deserve to be able to get some of the tasty stuff as well, not just grool that we feed prisoners. They're not eating shit you can't afford, they're not eating extremely expensive food. They're buying pop at $6 for a 12 pack, or a case of kool aide for a dollar. Snacks are cheap, they aren't cutting into their ability to feed their family. Best of all? They make kids happy. Kids that otherwise might notice that they're living in poverty in the richest nation in the world.

"You still have a serious logical disconnect here. You're saying that the state illegalizing all discrimination had massive long-term impact on our culture, and the evidence of that is that there was still discrimination practiced only 10 years after Jim crow was abolished? 

So the state enforcing the separation of blacks and whites for 3 generations (1890-1965) had NOTHING to do with creating an attitude that lasted a decade after the laws were removed? No, of course it had something to do with it.

So the endlessly repeated timeline, once again: govt creates problem, people recognize problem, govt uses force to fix problem, pats itself on the back. Dig a hole, fill it back in."

Also in this instance it wasn't even that many people, it just happened to be a few of the right people (doctors and hospitals).

"> *Here's one of my arguments:*

And I've already told you that it's a nonsensical argument.

1. The fact that the word was used is irrelevant. What matters is whether it was widespread and whether it was ever used in any official capacity. It wasn't. The piece of land was not called Palestine until it was under British rule. The fact that over the ages, you can find instances of people unofficially using the old, second century name - has not bearing on that.

2. I hereby proclaim that New York City is the capital of Lollipopville. I guess Lollipopville exists now! That's precisely the argument you just made. The fact that a word was used doesn't mean the place existed. It did not exist. None of the quality that determine statehood, nationhood, sovereignty, or any sort of unified, cohesive nature existed with Palestine. It was not a place, no matter how many times you cite examples of the word being used.

> *You've linked a Youtube video to do your arguing for you, but you seem incapable of actually writing a sentence that contains an argument, or linking a source that would substantiate an argument, or doing much other than calling me names out of frustration.*

I'm perfectly capable of expressing my own arguments, thank-you-very-much. But the point is that if you're going to be so stubborn that you're not even willing to take a few minutes to watch a video explaining something, why should I spend the time typing out a response? The fact that you were so enthusiastic about trashing the video without even watching it - shows that you're not actually interested in approaching the matter in a mature and intelligent way, so I'm not going to jump through your hoops if you're going to be so obstinate."

"The whole lore behind warlocks is that they are secretive and prefer to conduct rituals behind people's backs. The warlock class trainers for Alliance were actually hidden in some obscure places (deep cellar of a Slaughtered Lamb Inn in Mage district in Stormwind, that obscure shack near a small pond of water in Ironforge), reinforcing the idea of a hidden coven practicing forbidden art. Remember how Jaina reacted to Khadgar's manipulation of fel magic?

If you follow the Green Fire questline, a lot of background for new talents, namely new Grimoires, is explained, and how the new demons came to your command. And you follow in the steps of a whole coven, consisting of both Alliance and Horde races, that secretely seeks power. You even defeat the strongest of them to get your green fire. That's the way the warlock heroes can be.

I'm not even sure why warlocks are hated that much. Mages are far more destructive (remember Theramore, it was an arcane magic, not fel), and warriors are actually leading and initiating wars where thousands die. For every warlock doing shit (like Gul'dan) there are 3-4-10-50 other classes doing far more shit.

Consider warlocks to be 1940s gays of WoW. Everyone knows they exist, and some people even have friends, but there's an inevitable social stigma attached to the way you practice your private magic. One day warlocks will come out of the closets! But for now they pretebd to be mages or, I dunno, bakers?"

"**Shorter answer:** Momentum and kinetic energy are not necessarily conserved, and the precise statements regarding their conservation are contained in equations that describe what could possibly cause them not to be conserved. We can obtain similar conservation laws for higher moments of velocity (the third moment is related to heat flow). There are no special names for fourth or higher moments. We usually only work up to the second moment (energy) because the analysis is simpler, and we have to stop somewhere. There is a closure problem with the equations.

---

**Longer answer:** It is certainly true that mass is always conserved in a Newtonian system. But neither momentum nor kinetic energy is conserved in general. The momentum of a particle is conserved if there is no net external force. The total energy is conserved if the particle moves under the influence of a conservative force field (i.e., a force derivable from a potential). Kinetic energy is only one part of total energy and is not separately conserved except in some very special cases. For instance, in a two-body gravitational system, neither momentum nor kinetic energy is conserved. (If the motion is circular, then kinetic energy is conserved.)

Having said all that, you are absolutely right that it's not exactly a coincidence that mass, momentum, and energy are related to the zeroth, first, and second powers of velocity. In a more general setting like kinetic theory, which describes the motion of many particles (say, the gas molecules in some volume) in terms of a distribution function *F*. The distribution function *F* is a function of (**x**,**v**,t), where **x** is the position and **v** is the velocity, and *F* is a probability distribution over so-called phase space. The distribution function satisfies an equation called the Boltzmann equation.

Such a kinetic theory can be reduced to fluid models if we take *moments* of the distribution function and use the Boltzmann equation to simplify. The zeroth moment of F (also called the number density) is just the integral of F, and the resulting equation expresses conservation of mass. (The equation is also called the continuity equation in the context of fluids.) The first moment of F is the integral of **v**F over d**v** divided by the number density (also called **V**, the mean velocity), and you end up getting an equation in terms of **V**. The resulting equation expresses conservation of momentum. The second moment of F is related to the pressure tensor and the resulting equation expresses conservation of energy.

There is nothing stopping you from taking higher moments of F. For instance, the third moment is related to the heat flow, which expresses flow of energy, and the resulting equation is sometimes called the heat flux equation. 

We can keep going to the fourth moment, and so on. (There is no special name for any moment higher than the third moment, as far as I know.) However, it turns out that there is always some variable in the *n*th equation which cannot be solved for without the (*n*+1)th equation. We get an essentially infinite hierarchy of equations. So to have any hope of solving them, we have to truncate the hierarchy at some stage, and then either ignore the variables that need the higher equations or insert an equation of state that is determined from experiment or some other physical insight.

In almost all applications, we just truncate at the second moment equation (conservation of energy). Then we either just ignore the heat flux or use some equation of state for the heat flux in terms of the energy, momentum, and mass density.

(There are several reasons we usually just stop at the energy equation. First, Newton's second law is a second order differential equation, and so energy just turns out to be the highest moment of *F* that is physically relevant for many applications. Second, on a deeper mathematical level, the zeroth, first, and second moments can also be understood in the theory of L^(p) spaces with p = 0, 1, 2. These spaces have desirable properties that are not enjoyed by higher L^(p) spaces like L^(3). Second moments, for instance, are typically associated with some sort of analysis in terms of the Fourier transform.)

"Honestly, I like legion a lot, but it doesn't really recapture that for me. People probably think I'm crazy when I talk about this, but it's not so much rose tinted glasses as there have been ways to play this same way within the past few years.

Basically, I think a lot of the MMO feel came from the leveling process being way longer and having people spread amongst far less continents, zones, and even quests in the zones themselves. Quests now are so fast and you blow through them and so many of them with such ease that you don't really need other people to play with and they might even slow you down. Even if you want to group with other people despite this, other people aren't as interested in working together if it doesn't benefit them.

In the older versions of WoW questing was basically this giant long pain in the ass that was only alleviated by working with other players. You pretty much had your fun with those other players instead of the content itself. 

I'm not saying the content HAS to be boring and bad. But it certainly would have to take much longer and be more difficult to complete on your own to retain that. Part of me thinks some of this could be alleviated by just having fewer but much longer quests.

The demand for houses was high but the prices wanted by the vendors (in some cases just to break even or come out a little on top of their investment) was so far above the buying power of their average homeseeker that they were really struggling.

"I'd first like to say that this is coming from a New York Knicks fan, so we're supposed to hate LeBron, but I have some things to say about the circlejerk going on in this thread.

1. I can't find the source but I definitely remember seeing somewhere that this gif is entirely out of context, and LeBron is just goofing around with the kid. He also knows he is on national TV so he wouldn't actually be a dick while millions are watching - he was just kidding around.

2. This video was when he was with the Cleveland Cavaliers, a time when he was hated a LOT less than he is now. I'm sure many people wouldn't have reacted that way had they seen it back then. (this is also why it's been passed around a lot recently, because everyone hates him now)

3. For the people complaining about him making so much money: this man has worked unbelievably hard to get where he is, and it's arguable that he will become the best basketball player of all time over Jordan, if he isn't the greatest already. You have to give the man some credit.

4. I know it's the norm right now to hate LeBron, because of the 'decision', but if you followed his career in the past year, you will find that he has matured greatly. Many (not all) people who follow the NBA who hated him now see how he has grown and respect how he has won. I'm sorry to say it but hating LeBron is outdated.

5. Speaking of the decision, this seems to be the only reason non-basketball fans hate him, and many of them don't even understand the whole story behind it.

EDIT: I'd just like to also add how reddit doubts the worth of sports players in general. Lets be honest, the four major sports leagues (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL) make a LOT of money. This is from ticket prices, merchandise, endorsements, and what have you. The owners of teams are also worth millions, sometimes billions, of dollars. The leagues ALSO happen to consistently donate money to charity to help children and other people in poverty. These are the role models that many children aspire to be, due to their work ethic and talent. For the people who say that the athletes don't deserve that much: what do you suppose they do with the money? Donate even more to charity? The NBA (and the other leagues) is a business, not a charity. If you worked for a company that suddenly started making millions and millions in profit, your plan of action would most likely not be  ""Let's donate it all to charity"", it's ""Let's give everyone who worked so hard to make this company what it is more money"" /rant. (sorry for repeatedly using 'charity')"
"What Raoul doesnt tell is how the shit fucking smells...

After fear and loathing I was curious about diethylether, so after reading a bit I bought a bottle and tried some.

Well, no one was prepared for that smell. It smells like hospital, clean wounds and industrial grade cleaner. The effect was nice but the smell made it not worth it. Kind of like nitrous but lasts a bit longer.

The worst thing is is that after a few huffs you dont smell it anymore yourself, and when you go to sleep and wake up you suddenly smell that awful smell again.

">  The US experienced some of its greatest growth in the postwar period partly due to the domestic demand of a strong middle class.

This is true, but how sustainable was that growth without massive capital injections and the post-war realities of American manufacturing and intact infrastructure supplying a world which was largely in shambles? 

Massively subsidizing generational equity in property by giving GIs homes in Levittown and free college education and manufacturing jobs building and making everything that debt financed purchases are going to see sold in Europe and Asia is not something you can just recreate over and over again.


>How can inequality be reduced? 

>> Free (or interest free) college education

Even supposing all colleges, students, and curriculum are ""equal"" in terms of instruction, student capability, and usefulness to productive labor (and they're very, very much not), what happens when college is free/vastly more accessible for it? 

Does all labor become that much more productive? Does the time spent not working (which confers income) and not reproducing (which drives much consumer demand) during youth, but spent in college necessarily indicate the kind of wealth and demographic growth it's meant to? 


> universal healthcare

Even assuming all possible medical attention is necessary, deserved, and cannot be avoided by individual decision making, and not dependent on age, gender, habits, and with costs equally generated by the whole population (again, very, very much not so), where does the money come from? 



>minimum wages

Where does the money come from?

**The central question is** : 'ought, and how, should the government be the guarantor of  some existence?'

My contention is that it fundamentally should not attempt to do more than a very basic minimum, and that this minimum shouldn't even be particularly comfortable to live in for all who have any capacity for their own agency.


I'm open to proposals to the contrary - - about the 'ought', about the 'how' and about the 'some'  portions of that question - - and indeed, I don't want to build any a priori critique without giving people a chance to speak - - but I do not see why, save destitution, inequality is a problem for *governments* to solve for the people with their tools of coercion and redistribution, and not one for the people individually themselves.

Evolution is no longer an obscure science or beyond our vision.  It is well proven with tons of evidence so this argument by Augustine no longer applies.  Nor would his writings apply to cosmology, genetics, or geology.  

In fact, your quote from Augustine proves that religious mythology was created to for the purpose of explaining things we did not yet understand.  Your quote proves that the answers found in the Bible are made-up by man because of man's lack of factual knowledge.

>On the day on which God created the heaven and the earth - Aquinas

You may want to Google Stephen Hawking's ""God does not exist"" program.

""
“When people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense. Time didn’t exist before the big bang, so there is no time for god to make the universe in. It’s like asking directions to the edge of the earth; The Earth is a sphere; it doesn’t have an edge; so looking for it is a futile exercise. We are each free to believe what we want, and it’s my view that the simplest explanation is; there is no god. No one created our universe,and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization; There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful.” ― Stephen Hawking 

Genesis can not be realistic or truth.  The universe begins at the moment of the Big Bang.  There is no space, matter, or energy before that moment.  In fact there is no 'before' that moment.  So there is neither place nor time for a god to have existed or to have taken any action.

I had several breakdowns after findan Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and Google, and was soon indefinitely blocked from Wikipedia for my disruption and contention which nonetheless went without rebuttal.

They then rely on scripts to do most of their work which blindly revert above edits, and then automatically post vandalism notices on the editor's talk page which may stack until they reach another automatic block threat, all without mindful review.

Regarding conscription, attempts to dismantle the view of women as weak are about *choice*. If a woman *chooses* to pursue a field of work that is typically male, she should be allowed to. Personally, I want to be a teacher or government worker and I'm not going to alter my choice to be a martyr for women.

"I dunno about that it does have some rather glaring issues. I came easily come up with a list of faults the game has.   I'll try to be spoiler free here.

The need to play in online mode to get a reasonable amount of recruits.   

The grinding aspect of the game through resources and worth while kidnapping victims.

The annoying tech progression and base progress.  Not just the time required either  illogical aspects.  If I steal weapon ""x"" and depart with it why does it vanish?  Why can't I deploy with it next time even if it would be my one and only if I have yet to research it?

Side ops other than the limited gold ones lack  a good enough variety.


The lack of large complexes to infiltrate all areas feel extremely small and the one that tries to have a large feel to it does so artificially by not having a radar station.  Even then its small and the interiors still lack.  

Many inconsistencies in the world.  For example  intermodal containers.   There is no delivery vehicle capable of this job in the game.   So where are they coming from?   If they were already there then how are the bases getting resupplied after they are stolen?  Even places that could supply more resources like the oilfield we never see soldiers doing anything but their guard dutites.  So where is it coming from?

Motherbase is a annoyance and serves no real purpose to visit outside of story progression.  Or even worse makes a longer delay of actual game-play just to shower.    

No way to turn up difficulty when playing in the open world.

Some main missions can be done almost instantly.

Quite a bit of main missions feel like filler wastes and should have been side ops.

Deploying troops missions are better than the missions you get.  Really, I'm not even exaggerating or kidding here.  Why can't I assassinate the dictator?  That sounds more fun than most of the content in MSGV  and yet not only do the recruits get to do it but we can't even watch.

The main  super baddies you fight feel dull.   Even the ones that are suppose to be bad ass are more of a annoyance.  In some missions even forcing the fight to occur with them and to be spotted which shouldn't be in a stealth game.   You can't even use ""boss fight"" as a excuse as they aren't really bosses.

">However, I want people to have freedom to do what they want as long as they do not harm others.

We agree here - and like I said, those examples were just that: examples.  I don't necessarily support one side over another.

That said...

Owning a nuclear weapon doesn't kill anybody either but I don't see people fighting for the right of citizens to own them.  Same situation with fully automatic weapons - they don't kill anyone but there is no fervor or uproar that we cannot buy one today.  The argument to ban sales of those weapons is very easily applied to other weapons once you agree to *any* reason that citizens choices in weaponry should be restricted.  In fact, once you agree to ban any single weapon, you open the door to interpretation to apply that reasoning to other weapons.  The safest, and constitutional reasoning is that **any** weapon ban is unconstitutional...but we have them nonetheless.

It's not a false choice when pregnancy can happen despite efforts to prevent it.  They are called accidents.  They happen.  The reasoning that you should be abstinent is as ridiculous as saying being involved in a car crash is always your fault as well since you should have opted not to drive.  It's my opinion that it doesn't matter if the unborn child is alive or not - if it cannot survive outside the womb, it is (technically) a parasite and the mother should have a right to abort for any reason.  I say any reason because restricting (for example, only in cases of rape) it would not help at all as you cannot prove someone wasn't raped.

I agree on marriage - government should get out of that business and institute some other term for two persons seeking to legally combine their labor/assets.  In fact, just make a new  business entity that can be entered by any two consenting adults that are afforded tax and community property privileges.

On insurance, we currently have the exact system you propose.  Any American is free to purchase whatever insurance they want.  If you want freedom for business - well, that is not the purpose of the Constitution nor should it be.  Businesses do not have rights, people do.  We have laws to govern business such that people can pursue life, liberty and happiness.  Of course, we have laws to protect business - but only to the extent that business can succeed in providing quality goods and services to people.  Laws that restrict business operations may or may not be fair, but they exist and cannot infringe on any 'rights' because businesses do not have rights.

I've never voted to restrict rights of people, only ever voted no (or yes) to expand those rights (or take them away from government).  I vote to allow people vested in society greater voice than an unborn person as long as the unborn person is not viable outside the womb - this means I generally vote to permit abortions in any case, but only when the life of the mother is endangered for late-term abortions.  When it comes to business law, I determine if the net effect is greater happiness/life/liberty for people and vote accordingly.  This tends to mean I vote against any gun restrictions, vote for any drug legalization, no to any tax increases, and yes to most (not all) environmental restrictions for business, etc.

"> Driving drunk is not a crime and laws that prosecute it punish people who ""may"" commit a crime in the future. It is akin to passing a law preventing someone from buying a gun because they might shoot themselves or someone else.

We don't outlaw guns on the basis that you may shoot someone in the future (meaning murder or manslaughter - not self defense), but we do have laws (rightfully so) against reckless use of guns.    You have the right to bear arms and carry and all that, but if you act reckless -- like start shooting randomly or waving it around, you run into legal problems.

It's a joke and it's sad you fell for it. The game itself is lacking bad, 2011 was probably the best IMO. 2012 pissed me off bad. I'm not even going to get into how unrealistic the driving physics are because you said it yourself, it's ""not a fulll sim"". Which is bullshit because I bought into the hype around F1 2012 talking about how CM upgraded all the physics/handling and this and that blah blah.. what a disappointment. Just because you suck at driving a real racing sim doesn't mean they are bland. They aren't for everyone dude."

"The remaps ARE the band-aid to the overarching problem that attributes are just a horrible game mechanic. Remove that and we're back to the original problem of players being stuck with horrible attributes until the end of time.

Removing attributes all together shouldn't be that big of a project. Especially when it doesn't have to be replaced by anything. Everyone gets the same base training speed and implants can give gradual increases in speed up to some arbitrary number in the 15 - 20% range.

Though I wouldn't even be against removing attribute implants all together as well, as it just keeps moving the problem from one place to another. I always use the removal of learning skills as a baseline for stuff like this. Learning skills were removed because they were a 'must have' for anyone with any sense and didn't provide any meaningful gameplay. In the same vein attribute implants and any passive bonus that would otherwise increase training speed is also a 'must have' for anyone with any sense.

If bonuses must exist for skill training then I'd say provide them in the form of skill injectors or drugs. Stuff that gives a short concentrated burst of progress and not a passive bonus over a longer time. And most importantly something that people don't feel the need to have just to min-max their training time and, in fact, couldn't even do if they wanted to."

"But in War Thunder, there aren't any scenarios where it could be used the way it was historically used in anti-aircraft role.

I mean, historically the 8.8cm FlaK cannons were used against high altitude bomber formations in grouped, co-ordinated fashion to achieve high barrage density because you can't reliably hit targets at that altitude and with such slow rate of fire. The shells were timed to explode after flying a certain time - this was done manually for each shell before loading, as far as I know... And lower altitude targets are better attacked with lighter caliber arms with higher rate of fire.

War Thunder also does not have the necessary fire control systems to coordinate firing a flak barrage even if you did get several 8.8 FlaK trucks together to form a battery. There are also probably no tools to set up the timing on the fragmentation shells, and giving players access to the AI's auto-adjusting (effectively proximity fuzed) shells would be lunacy...

And to top it off, there aren't any high altitude bomber formation targets, either. So what you would use that flak shell for is a mystery to me. You might as well give it to the Tiger H1 and Tiger E as well, while you're at it - it would have about the same utility..."

"Let's say you are running an experiment with the intent to answer the question: ""Does A cause B?"" It is universally recognized that in order to draw conclusions about this question that could be considered scientific law, the ONLY variable that would be manipulated in the experiment is A.

In any social science, it is literally impossible (maybe one day with super advanced technology this will no longer be the case) to control every variable - for instance, time and place. This is the problem that Smith acknowledges. My point is just that, for some reason, economists tend to ignore this epistemic issue.

Note that I'm not saying that empiricism/math/statistics are useless in economics. I'm just saying that it is insufficient for determining economic law.

"The performance of English teams in Europe is now reaching crisis levels.

People will go on about Porto being a top european team - and they are - but the budgets of these two teams are incomparable. Chelsea could buy any of Porto's players with pocket change. Most of Chelsea's players could just have easily have signed for real madrid and barca.

People will get partisan and talk about individual games and teams, but this is far from Chelsea's problem - it is all English teams problem. When was the last time you saw an English team dominate the game and win convincingly against top european opposition? Even Livepool and Chelsea only won the CL by parking the bus. Only United have won it whilst playing well.

It has nothing to do with the quality of English players, because most top English teams feature very few. I don't know if it's coaching, mentality or even doping, but it is clearly obvious that there is something fundamentally flawed in English football in comparison with european rivals, and if it goes on much longer we will use the 4th CL place and the whole ridiculous PL bubble will collapse.

EDIT: Just to clarify, I was saying that Chelsea competed with Real and Barca for the signatures of many of the players now on Chelsea's books. I am not saying that they would get into Real or Barca's squads on current form.

Tomlin has been to Gillette a grand total of 4 fucking times in his 8+ year coaching career, out of 128+ regular season games plus any post-season match-ups. His experience with using the radio headsets in Gillette culminates to less than 3% of his entire fucking football game experience.

> Rodgers' manifesto condemns men as much as it does women. The man hated other people.


Did you notice that the majority of his hate was based around women? About how white girls shouldn't be hanging out with coloured men? Yes, there was racist hatred for coloured and Asian men there - but the majority of it was based on the fact that girls were hanging out with *them*, and not him. He was just another 'red pill' type of guy who thought women should be fawning over him because he was such a nice guy - and when they didn't he got angry. 



>Men suffering is not a result of rape culture; this is merely you, and others, co-opting men's issues to bolster your own ideological agendas.


Oh, so men suffering is just a result of other men? Not of the society that women have to deal with? Okay then. And yes, you're right - wanting the same rights and respect as men is *Idealogical*. Sorry, I was obviously dreaming there.



>Why are rape numbers so high? Well, they're not, really.


Um, yes, they *are*. They might be declining, but that doesn't mean they're not still ridiculously high. In New Zealand (where I live, and which has a population of 4.43 million) one *in three* girls will experience some form of sexual assault before they turn sixteen. One in five women will experience it as an adult. That's the statistics for the reported assaults - and only 9% is ever reported. 


> Besides, more men are raped in prison than women are outside of it. Rape is really a men's issue.


If it is a men's issue, then why aren't men fixing it? More men are raped in prison then women outside of it, so why aren't you *doing anything*?! Doesn't that make you angry?! Doesn't that make you sick to your stomach? Because every time I read in the papers or online or watch on the news that someone - man or woman - has been raped, it honestly makes me feel physically ill. How can you not want to stop that? 

Rape culture is the trivialisation of rape and it is something that affects everyone, not just women. Prison rape can only be included in that. I don't know why there are so many more rapes in prison than outside of it - I imagine it is because putting a lot of possibly violent people in one place would just reduce sex as another weapon. Look, just because there are more people dying of heart disease doesn't mean you stop researching and treating lung cancer. It's just one more issue that needs to be addressed and fixed. 



>It turns out a crime where the only evidence is frequently he said she said is immensely difficult to prosecute. That's not rape culture, that's the fucking justice system. You need more than feelings to convict.


Yes, you do need more than feelings to convict. There's this thing called a rape kit, which is used to gather semen, skin (from under the victims nails where they have scratched at their attacker) and other evidence. In New Zealand, it is free to get a rape kit done (in hospital, or local GP, or even by police). In America, it costs around $800. And for a lot of people, that's a lot of money. Not to mention the costs of lawyers if the case actually gets to court. So is it any wonder that so many rape cases are 'he said she said'? And I agree with you - it is incredibly hard to prosecute when there are cases where women are saying men raped them when they didn't. But just because those cases are happening, doesn't give police the right to ignore actual cases of rape on the off chance that she's lying, or even worse - implying that if she's been drinking, coming from the 'wrong part of town' or is showing 'too much skin' that she had it coming! It's not just a matter of it being difficult to get evidence - it's a matter of victim blaming, trivialisation of sexual assault and, sometimes, victims just being too fucking traumatised and ashamed to get help.




>Being un-manly when you're a man. It's perfectly OK for women to be women. Hell, women can even be manly, no one cares, it's not tainting manliness. What isn't okay is to give manliness up.


So women can be masculine, but men can't be feminine? You've just proved my point! Why isn't it okay for a man to 'give manliness up'? It's because lack of masculinity *implies* femininity. *That's* the issue. There's nothing wrong with being either masculine Or feminine, (or androgynous for that matter). But to say that a man Has to be manly, and not feminine? Whereas a woman can be masculine? That's the same as saying it's okay to aspire to be a man, but not to be a woman. That in society, women can wear pants and be see as normal, but men can't wear skirts for fear of being seen as weird. Do you see what I'm saying here? 



> Those insults are shaming men for having low masculinity, not saying anything about femininity.


Of *course* they're saying something about femininity! They're *entirely based* on femininity! When we are young, ""don't be a girl"" is used as an insult. As we age, we use ""Cunt"" and ""Pussy"". How can you say they're *not* insulting someone based on femininity, when the words themselves refer to the *vagina?!*



>Women aren't less in society in any way.


That's like telling a black person that racism doesn't exist. We *are* less in society. Just because you don't experience it, doesn't mean it's not happening. I've given you examples (less pay, femininity used as an insult, lack of women in positions of power or as world leaders, blatant sexism. These are ways in which we are less. These are some of the things that contribute to rape culture. 



>Yeah, this is nothing more than political rambling where you declare you must be right otherwise everyone would already be agreeing you're right. Sorry, that doesn't work.


I am telling you that I believe I am right because these things are what I have experienced. This is what *all* women experience, in some shape or form. I *know* these things to be true. If you don't agree, that's your choice and I respect it. I'm infuriated and saddened by it, but I respect it. But, to me and every other woman out there - this *is our truth*. Our *fact*.

you don't need to put away drugs for good, just stop letting yourself hide from reality so much. It's not childish to enjoy substances, it's childish to use them as something of a more permanent lens through which you see reality.

Two of the four gospels were not eye-witness accounts. They are held as valid because they do not contradict the two eye-witness accounts and that Mark and Luke were around long enough to have gotten first hand accounts from those who were eye witnesses, the twelve apostles. The link goes into more detail.

They were written prior to 70 A.D., not hundreds of years later. So approx 40 years after Jesus's death and resurrection. 

Things to consider when dating or even reading the Gospels. They were written almost 2000 years ago and most likely in Aramaic/Greek. They weren't written I don't think with the intent to be completely seemless in order to prove to the mass of unbelievers that it's true, because fault would be found regardless.

"i would not 'train through the pain' - in my opinion, healthy joints are way more important than bulging legs.  common wisdom is that pain during an exercise either means your form is wrong (and you're in the process of injuring yourself) or you've got an injury.  assuming you don't have any pre-existing knee injuries, that means your form is off, even if guys at the gym say it's great - squat form is as personal as our anatomy, and you've got to zero in on the squat form that works with the particular way you're put together.

Thing is, people are going to keep using poppers despite its consequences. Anyone who is a recreational drug user, from mild stuff like pot to heavier stuff like meth, combine it with poppers to bring it to the next level/high because it's a **relatively safe** combination.

So even if it means using isopropyl/pentyl means they might suffer terrible side effects, they'll still do it. 

The best way we can avoid this is to target specifically the manufacturers and the sellers. Poppers are already illegal to begin with but the reason why toxic formulas keep appearing on the market is because the sellers/resellers aren't making their product FOR the consumers - they're producing it SPECIFICALLY to bypass the legal laws, thus if it means putting out bad formulations 

At same time this forum also serves as a central hub to not just discuss our fun times but also gather as much information on poppers as possible. Most websites with dedicated forums eventually get shut down or overtaken by greed and the websites start to self promote - this subreddit serves with the users' interest first and foremost.

The UK's open stance on poppers is something unexpected and I'm honestly hoping it'll be something they'll look into. If one country actually allows for the regular, pure amyl nitrite formulation to be produced, it'll eventually find its way into the underground market in countries that deem it illegal - even if it's illegal, at least we'll get the CLEAN poppers circulating around and not rely on manufacturers' who use alternatives that can hurt consumers.

Like, clean cocaine is far more dangerous and in higher circulation due to high demand, so being able to get proper poppers should also be feasible. "

"Spoken like a person that has no idea about how bad squirrels are. They are literally furry rats, it's not a comparison, they are actually directly related to them. They gnaw and tear into houses all the time, and the only way to keep a squirrel out of a house it wants to get into is to have a steel house (obviously not an option). They can chew through wood, plastic, even cement (over time obviously). The reason you film it is because you can't afford to dig into your walls just to check is traps were set, so you set a camera up that's hooked up to a computer, and you can just check the feed to see if it's been set off.

Can we as a civilization grow past this idea that all animal life is sacred, and that we most go past all lengths to make sure nothing is killed when it might have been kept alive? If you really have an issue with animal life being taken meaninglessly then go protest them hunting wild hogs or anytime a animal is slaughter and the meat is never used. Squirrels are a pest (just like wild hogs) and both are fine to kill so long as you're not wiping out an entire population."

"Anti vaccination retards are not the same as someone who thinks children shouldn't have speed. I *have* been reading about it for many, many years and I see the polls, and the charts and graphs, and all the biased and influenced data and I also see kids in real life, and drug addicts and I have seen child after child get started with amphetamines and before you know it, many of them are snorting their meds, selling their meds to friend  who enjoy it, creating more addicts. There was a huge crowd of kids who snorted adderall when I was in high school 15-20 years ago and it was nowhere near as popular as it is today. The stuff is over prescribed, it is given to children much too young, and it is prescribed by doctors (perhaps like your wife, I don't know), who have absolutely no idea what taking speed feels like. The dopamine rush, the high, the crash, the lows, the ""strung out"" feeling that comes with it, the craving for more of the drug when it wears off, most of these doctors have no idea about any of that because they have never taken the drug. Yet they give it to small children because some data shows that they pay attention more when under the influence of it. It's insane. These people that think it's cool to give it to kids have obviously never been around real drug addicts. 

During my speed years, when I couldn't get meth or coke, adderall was a fine replacement. A very fine replacement. And I am NOT saying that just because I personally abused it, everyone else will too. That is not what I am saying. I'm saying that the drug is extremely dangerous as far as addiction goes. Most people who take something that makes them feel very good, want to repeat the experience. This is how addiction starts. Why play with that kind of fire when there are many other perfectly acceptable AND successful ways to treat the problem? These drugs, even in small, prescribed doses are still very potent stimulants that create a significant amount of dopamine production in the brain. This dopamine surge causes some intense euphoric feelings in the user. It gives a ""rush"" of sorts. Giving our children a buzz like that is not the answer. It just isn't. Maybe somewhere, there are extreme cases where such a drastic measure may be required or at least considered but other than that, no way. The percent of children in this country walking around under the influence of amphetamine is absolutely sickening. You cannot tell me the world needs that many kids on amphetamine. No amount of graphs and charts are going to convince me (or any reasonable human being) that it is necessary to put that many kids on speed. It's a disgrace how easy it is to get it prescribed. An absolute disgrace. Your wife is part of this shameful practice. 

All the people in the world that can be helped by reasonable, sane doctors and then we have idiot quacks, thinking their abilities and power should be put to use shoveling speed into the mouths of children instead of helping people. The problem is, people like your wife don't even think they are doing anything wrong. In fact, they actually think they ARE helping people which speaks for the fact that they aren't necessarily bad people, they are simply misinformed and choose to stick by that misinformation instead of thinking rationally and realizing that most kids who walk into your office, don't need to be on amphetamine. Doctors should have to have a real, personal understanding of addiction and the drug culture in general, before they prescribe amphetamine to someone. They need to at least realize that with something this powerful, even one pill could quickly and absolutely turn into a huge problem for many people.

I HAVE read and read about this stuff. I have read the data and I realize that there are a significant percentage of people who think they were helped by the drug. I also realize that there is a significant percentage of people who know their lives were turned upside down by the drug. I also have personally lived in a house where someone close to me was prescribed it for years. I've also been around numerous people who ended up taking it for fun. Some of those people were prescribed it and some of them weren't. I have witnessed much more illegal and dangerous behavior associated with this drug than I ever have, people who have had their lives saved by it. And this is coming from a man who has a wife whose extremely painful and debilitating migraines/cluster headaches were made tolerable from Adderall after years of suffering. I still say this stuff does not need to be prescribed to children."

I do agree that those types of games aren't always boring, but it takes a lot to make them interesting and unique. Take the game variant Micheal Meyers. I am not sure of its origins, but I first encountered it in Rainbow Six when I was younger. The goal was to run around and not get stabbed by a man with a knife. You couldn't shoot or attack back until you were the last person alive. This is a rather humorous, yet still intense game mode. 

Last month I was watching my brother play CoD and witnessed them playing the same game type. So I guess the point is, that even some form of comic relief works well, regardless of how it is marketed, but how it actually is played. 

As for TF2 being solely based in humor, I have to disagree. I mean, they use loads and loads of humor on top of intense gameplay, but I wouldn't compare it to normal comedy. They have, in a weird sense, incorporated a sickness into it. An ill depravity that runs through the course of the game. You're a group of mercenaries murdering another group of mercenaries for no good reasons at the hands of immortal titans competing for gravel pits, warehouses, and wells. There is something...depraved about that. 

It is a humorous game, but if you get the back-story and really sit on it, it does have a darker side. It just isn't marketed that way. Just the opposite of the other games, marketed serious, but have a humorous community or light to view some parts in.  

I'd also think another important factor is intensity. It seems to me like a lot of devs try to create intensity with seriousness, but TF2 manages to create that same intensity with humor. "

"Fascinating stuff! 

What I find most relevant to my post is this particular passage of the author's analysis:

>How can this process be ended? Through a shift in perception, caused by the way one attends to feelings, using the categories of appropriate attention [see MN 2]. As the Buddha states in DN 21, rather than viewing a feeling as an appealing or unappealing thing, one should look at it as part of a causal process: when a particular feeling is pursued, do skillful or unskillful qualities increase in the mind? If skillful qualities increase, the feeling may be pursued. If unskillful qualities increase, it shouldn't. When comparing feelings that lead to skillful qualities, notice which are more refined: those accompanied with thinking (directed thought) and evaluation, or those free of thinking and evaluation, as in the higher stages of mental absorption, or jhana. When seeing this, there is a tendency to opt for the more refined feelings, and this cuts through the act of thinking that, according to MN 18, provides the basis for papañca.

In essence, by attending to feelings within the context of the Four Noble Truths, one is able to see which feelings are worth pursuing and which are not. A silent mind that supports deep levels of concentration should be found superior to that of a thinking mind.

A quick question about the previous passage: 

>What are these perceptions & categories that assail the person who papañcizes? Sn 4.14 states that the root of the categories of papañca is the perception, ""I am the thinker."" From this self-reflexive thought — in which one conceives a ""self,"" a thing corresponding to the concept of ""I"" — a number of categories can be derived: being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to, signifier/signified. Once one's self becomes a thing under the rubric of these categories, it's impossible not to be assailed by the perceptions & categories derived from these basic distinctions. When there's the sense of identification with something that experiences, then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact, some feelings will seem appealing — worth getting for the self — and others will seem unappealing — worth pushing away. From this there grows desire, which comes into conflict with the desires of others who are also engaging in papañca. This is how inner objectifications breed external contention.

Is the author stating that a notion of self stems directly from papañca? Or are there other factors involved in the creation of self not mentioned?

Justice would be showing Pharaoh the extent of his wrongdoing, by giving him the strength to endure the life experience necessary for that perspective. Pharaoh wanted to stand up to Moses. God didn't violate his free will, God enabled him to carry out his free will. The end result was justice.

Justice in the form of killing innocent children that (since you admitted) ""don't have responsibilities"" for what their parents do? Wouldn't Justice have been killing the parents responsible for the wrong-doing against the Israelites and sending them straight to a hell or making them not exist or something like that? I can think of multiple forms of justice that are better than killing the children of the perpetrator.

>It's the most authoritative opinion there is. Maimonides is one of the greatest Jewish scholars of all time, with a grasp of the material literally beyond the reach of every person currently alive.

So what he says is true because he was an authority?

>That sounds like an opinion. Also, [Citation Needed]

You're right, how shameful of me. Retracted.

>Christians are irrelevant for Jewish exegesis of the Torah. They worship a pagan mangod and can't even translate Isaiah 7:14 properly. You might as well ask a YEC fundie what he thinks about string theory for all the relevance that opinion will hold.

Can you elaborate? I don't understand what you mean by this. Are you saying that if someone is a Christian, their opinion on religious texts is inherently invalid? Why? Why is a Jewish authority inherently correct, and a Christian authority inherently incorrect on this subject? And the hypocrisy of calling their god pagan when others can just call yours pagan as well in the same way notwithstanding, how do you know their god isn't really a god?

>Free will is fundamental to God's Creation (see Deut 30:19). Are you suggesting that God override someone's freedom of choice because future people might misinterpret a fable?

Again, irrelevant, what does free will have to do with inspiring the bible to be written more clearly? Or do you think the bible is not inspired by your god? If so that takes me by surprise and I'm sorry for assuming.

>Life is funny like that. Perhaps he wasn't rewarded for the vow but won the battle for other reasons. Why would this be problematic?

It's not problematic if he just coincidentally won the battle, but then all the bad stuff that happens to him afterwards could have had nothing to do with god. Thus nullifying your original argument. (And nullifying mine, which is fine, since I'm not claiming that the Torah contains true stories or that Yahweh exists)

>Because until the daughter walked out of the household, the vow was still valid. As soon as she did, it was annulled. The end.

I can see that point. I'll concede on this one.

>Free will. Tell me, would you prefer an all-knowing and all-mighty paternalistic force controlling your every action to stop you from doing the wrong thing? Or would you rather have the freedom of choice? Honestly, that seems like an obvious choice to me.

If I were all-knowing, and all-powerful, I'm sure I could come up with a more creative way of stopping the girl from being brutally sacrificed to me, because the person sacrificing her misunderstood me. He thought he had to sacrifice whatever came walking out of that house to greet him when he came home, BECAUSE he won the war. If I were all powerful, it doesn't violate free will to say ""Hey Jephtah, I had nothing to do with you winning the war, you don't have to murder your daughter"". What about doing that, specifically, violates free will? Additionally I would rather have neither to answer your question.

>I don't see how that's a response to my statement. The worst punishment someone can suffer is for their child to die. David, a king, is judged at a higher standard than the rest of us. He acts badly, and publicly, and therefore is punished. The end.

But HE didn't get punished. His child got punished for HIS crimes. Sure it hurts David to lose a kid, but David is still ALIVE and breathing and able to do things. However if you believe that all these sacrificed children instantly go to heaven, I could see how you would not put much value on their lives. If that is true though, how could David be punished by knowing that his child got magically sent to heaven before having to feel the harsh reality of being an adulthood and seeing difficult things?

Right. In the light of this comment, what do you think of the fundamentalist Christians attitude trying to prevent gay marriage?

> To your question, while of course there is not yet any experimental evidence of universes outside our own (and perhaps there never will be) there is nevertheless good theoretical reasons to believe that they might exist, independent of wanting to prove away god. 

I accept your answer that you have 'good theoretical reasons to believe' despite the lack of evidence, if you accept my answer that I have 'good philosophical reasons to believe' God despite the lack of evidence, too. I know you said you don't really believe it, but I am here trying to point out a double standard.

> there is no real reason to think that it is NOT the case (we know our universe exists, what reason is there that others couldn't as well?).

The problem is that such kind of thinking is inherently irrational. This is wishful thinking. The fact that our Universe exists is evidence that our Universe exists, and nothing more. Anything beyond that violates the Law of Identity.

> This is in contrast to the god hypothesis which requires one to further explain how god happens to be.

No, it doesn't. An explanation doesn't have to be explained. I could likewise claim how did the multiverse came to be, couldn't I?

> This is in contrast to designed objects: a complex being (us) constructs something less complex.

No, he doesn't. This is a myth. Regardless of how you define 'complexity', you can always find example of things that are more complex than human beings that we created. Capacity to create things more complex than oneself comes from specialization.

"I doubt this is going to be a popular opinion here, but am I the only one who's thinking that this just is NOT a good time to be getting into the console market?  

It's arguably got too many competitors in it already, and with THREE entrenched parties, it's going to be really goddamn difficult to find a niche and a customer base.  Nintendo has the kids and the casuals along with their own deeply devoted fanbase, Microsoft has the online gamers and whoever Kinect appeals to (someone's buying them), and Sony has the hardcore gaming / cutting-edge crowd.  And all three are doing everything they can to ""monopolize"" people's TV sets by adding media distribution options.

That doesn't leave much elbow room.  Now I'm sure when the Steambox comes out, there will at least be some crossover purchases from the PC Ubermensch finally debasing themselves with a console.  But at the same time, that could potentially just hasten the demise of PC gaming.

(Also, relatedly, I've got this nasty feeling that the Steambox may actually be Steam attempting to get out of the PC gaming market before it's too late, but I'm not sure this is the right way to do it.)

Maybe Valve has something truly original and exciting up their sleeve that they're not telling anyone about Until It's Ready, but if it's just Steam moved onto a console...  eh.  If Big Picture Mode is a taste of things to come, I just don't see how it's going to have much of a customer base, given how entrenched the competition is.

Or, at the very least, they are going to have to have one fucking BRILLIANT marketing campaign to convince console gamers to jump ship.

Edit: TL;DR - Valve's taking a BIG risk here, and there's a hint of desperation to it that concerns me.  A company generally doesn't make a move into an overcrowded market like this unless their alternatives are even worse.  Unless, that is, they have one hell of an ace up their sleeve."

How long before the world realizes that something is happening? How long before they start quarantining all dead just in case? 7000 a day? That is 1 or 2 dead they are seeing. That is maybe 20 bites that they have sealed off somewhere in case it is a new sickness. Yet this will destroy society? "
"Just a few corrections:

> These Asauchi are ""forged"" into zanpakuto ""blanks"" - which resemble a standard katana.  A blank is issued to each recruit upon entering the Shinigami academy.  They train with it, and keep it with them constantly - eventually forming a bond with it.  That bonding process ""imprints"" a portion of the Shinigami's soul onto the amalgam (sound familiar), at which point the Asauchi and the imprint together become a true Zanpakuto.  Zanpakuto spirits are the spiritual manifestation of that amalgam.  In general they're only visible to the Shinigami within their soulscape - but with training and a strong relationship with their Zanpakuto spirit, can be manifest outside as well.

Zanpakutou spirits aren't a manifestation of the Spirit-Asauchi amalgam. Zanpakutou spirits exist without an Asauchi (as evidenced by Hitsugaya speaking to Hyourinmaru long before becoming a Shinigami), they just can't be manifested in physical form until they're given a body (Asauchi).

> Aizen/Tousen/Gin did *something* to the Vizard to induce Hollowification within them.  It hasn't been explained exactly what was done - but the Vizard immediately began forming masks.  Their spiritual bodies didn't explode and reform.  Additionally, those that we saw assume a ""complete"" Hollow state (Kensei, Hiyori) didn't manifest Hollow holes either.

It was actually explained what happened to the Visoreds. As Urahara explained Hollowfication, he was talking specifically about what happened to the Visoreds. A Hollow soul was injected into them (possibly in the same way Yhwach's soul has been injected into some Shinigami, by having the souls ""laid around"") which mingled with their own souls, before being stabilized by Urahara's vaccine before Soul Suicide could occur. So this option:

>  * Aizen/Tousen/Gin's process may have ""inserted"" a Hollow into the Vizard, and this is a manifestation of that.

Is the correct one, as per Urahara's explanation. Though it's clear that the existing Zanpakutou spirit (or at least its body) influenced the Hollow soul, as evidenced by Tousen's Resurreccion whose appearance and abilities are heavily referential to Suzumushi's own themes."

People get caught up in the mindset of ""awesome, Batman's gonna bring justice!"" but forget that a large part of the movie is dedicated to setting Batman up as extra-judicial, someone who is outside the system and is beholden to no one, and using him as an example of a morally defensible response to extremism.

"> randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events

Ah, yes, as I said, this ""arbitrariness"" is not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about true mathematical randomness, which is 100% predictable, from start to finish, as you can see if you look at Pascal's triangle, and my fabric, which I linked to earlier.  The thing you're thinking of is the more common term that is not actually random, just a more general sense of being unknown/unpredictable.  Rolling dice is totally random, and predictable.  As is everything else, it's just that because we are limited beings, we don't know where we are in the calculation, and thus can't predict/know what will happen next.  

> when a photon is shot at a detector, we don't seem to be able to know or influence what specific spot the photon will collapse to, without physical interaction. that's the randomness copenhagen interpretation claims, but i disagree upon.

Maybe, but who cares exactly which spot a photon is at a precise period of time?  It's not important to life.  What matters is the energy of how things are changing and where things, in general, are going now and in the future.  I mean, it's not important to me whether the 4098729879635th quark from the top left of my elbow is spinning up or down at the 9875419879134875098237450987th (to the 7450982734598723049587th power) millisecond past noon today.  But what is important is the general direction my whole body (a wave, for the most part) is heading.  Am I going into the kitchen, or the bathroom?  But maybe you think it's important to focus on the tiny material details (the photon location), and that's cool, if you want to try to predict where it's going to be, if you want.

That's the whole thing I've been saying about evolution being about diversity in the system so that all different kinds of things end up coming together to form an emergent system.

"Sometimes I wonder what people like that think mental illness is.  I mean, your brain lying to you and saying it would be better if you were dead is basically the definition of depression^*, and being suicidal is really common with most other types mental illness (negative symptoms of schizophrenia, mixed states with bipolar disorder, etc.).  Also, I'm pretty sure ""yeah, your life does actually suck and will never improve so you should just give up"" is up there with ""Just be happy!

"Classically, yes, the Prisoner's Dilemma is a one shot deal, and it has been shown that non-classical, long-term iterations of the Dilemma favor cooperation over defection (evolution is one example). In this, we are agreed. Humans, however, suck at thinking in terms much longer than their lifespans, and that's where we run into problems. All forms of communism that have been attempted on a large scale have suffered from someone (usually the appointed leader) defecting from the system, breaking rules, and prospering at the expense of others."
">Applying skepticism too universally is unworkable. If nothing else, it would invariably lead to solipsism.

I can understand how one might draw that conclusion. Solipsism is a conclusion which can be drawn when you break reality down to those most simplest form, 'I exist, can I be sure anything else does?'. That being said I find the solipsism conclusion a rather moot point, as adds nothing to the understanding of this perceived reality we all share. What matters to me is 1.) Is this reality consistent from point to point? 2.) Can it be measured to predicatively provide the same results when said action is taken based on previous experiences. 

Solipsism being a potential conclusion from skepticism doesn't somehow make its application to reality as a whole any less useful. More importantly it doesn't give religion any special exception to the rules of reality which is claimed without evidence to back it up.

"Not true, at least not with regard to drug laws.

The DEA has the authority to re-schedule substances, such as moving cannabis out of Schedule 1 (high risk of abuse, no medical value) and into another schedule that allows for medical use. The president appoints the DEA director. Obama kept Michele Leonhart, a Bush appointee, at the helm of the DEA when he took office.

Also, the president can order the DOJ to stop enforcing specific laws, as Obama did for the Defense of Marriage Act, and as he kinda-sorta-but-not-really did for cannabis cultivation in medical marijuana states until he did an about-face on that issue.

It would take an act of Congress or a ruling of the Supreme Court to repeal or strike down the Controlled Substances Act, but the president is well within his power to make de facto legalization happen. Not only that, but he has the power to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to put legalization on the agenda for Congress to pursue. So far, he has done neither."
"I do, in fact, believe that I should owe more back to society than someone less privileged than myself.
I am not wealthy by American standards, but I am not foolish enough to believe that I didn't have an advantage growing up with a roof over my head and food on the table.  My parents could afford a computer when I was 12, which developed the skills that employ me.  

So, yes, I should have to give back more than someone with less.  I shouldn't get as many social benefits.  
But likewise, I shouldn't pay in as much as someone making twice as much as me, and so on.  

Obviously we can't say ""well this person had absolutely nothing growing up, so we must all have nothing to level the playing field."".  What we *can* do is be happy with owning a slighter older car, or not upgrading our gaming PC so often, and instead give that disadvantaged person the opportunity to grow and contribute.  We should feed, clothe and educate them until they are at a point in which they can provide that on their own. 

The problem with your idea of ""fair"" is that it is detrimental to society as a whole.  It wastes huge amounts of human capital.

Do you really believe the Walton family are as valuable to society as their net worth and income would seem to suggest?  I frankly, do not.  
I believe our society would benefit much, much more by distributing some of their wealth to develop others.  

We already do this in a lot of ways... we fund schools, we build roads, we pay for police and fire fighters.   
What if we said ""No that's not fair, I don't want to pay for the roads you drive on!""?  What if only the super rich could afford to drive, because they built a private road network?  Do you think that would have a negative or positive effect on society? It's fair, right?
Of course that's an extreme example, but it proves a point.  

We all share already, so why not share a little more?  Why do the Waltons need to sit on so much cash that nobody in their family, for generations and generations to come, ever has to lift a finger again?

As for the Boko Haram incident, obviously it's awful, obviously bad things happen to good, innocent people all around the world at all times. However the network news cannot always cover every one of these stories, there are just far too many of them.

There's no particular evidence that gun proliferation is a driving factor in public safety.  If it were, you'd expect, say, the UK's murder rate to drop after their ban.  It didn't- it went up before coming back down to what it was.  You'd also maybe expect Australia's murder rate to go down- and it did, by the exact same amount ours did, as gun ownership increased.

Truth is, gun ownership isn't the driving factor in societal violence.  It barely even figures in.  But there is one thing gun control *is* useful for- it keeps people fighting with one another rather than looking at who's really screwing us over."

"In gaelic cultures whilst still patrynomic, there are quite a few ways to label someone as 'son of' or 'daughter of', or even 'wife to son of'.

The most common ways are:

Am addition of 'O(g)' or 'Mac' before the surname for men, and 'Ni' or 'Nic' for women. In anglicised gaelic names, you simply use the male for for women too.

For example: 
Sean O'Malley = Sean, descendant of Malley.
Jack Mac ' Donald  = Jack, son of Donald

Typically, a son would keep their fathers surname, so it wasn't unusual to have a surname that denotes you as a son of someone who does not share a name with your father.

The third one is the addition of 'Fitz', which is a Norman influence on Gaelic.

For example, my aunt has the surname 'Fitzgerald', meaning son of Gerald. If she was living in the Gaeltahct, then that would probably be frowned upon, and instead her name would be 'Niamh Bean Fitzgerald', meaning 'Wife of the Son of Gerald'.

I do not need to assume- in real life many working class people have started successful businesses.  However people's ability to do that can be taken away by various police states.

">As a subset of the total population it is. That's .0009 x 330,000,000 = 297,000. That's a lot of people damaged from vaccines.

That's not how one would determine prevalence of damage. According to your document there are 25000 claims of damage, that's 25000/330,000,000 or 0.0007 percent. That's your chance of having an adverse reaction. Your chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime would be 0.03 percent or 1 out of 3000.

"thats a nice analogy, yes the mechanics are not super-technical, but to actually make progress it was far more than turning up on raid day and farming it.  You needed a guild that had the support structures in place to farm the consumables during the week, you needed almost twice as many players as could fit in the raid to make a full clear swapping players in and out for different encounters.  You didnt need 8 tanks for most of the bosses but you did for 4 horsemen, so it meant having closer to 50 players geared rather than just 40.  The guilds that did make progress were not a bunch of back-peddling casuals it was closer to 100 people working 7 days a week to make one/two/three attempts in Naxx and even then it didnt guarentee success.  AFAIK no guild had Naxx on farm.

Perhaps the reason Naxx 40 was not nerfed is because TBC development was well under way, and Blizz knew that it would become redundant within months.  Either way the guilds that did clear Naxx would faceroll any content in TBC and beyond, and they did."
"I was introduced to the RP ideas when I read Married Man Sex Life.

I'm wondering if the audience has gotten younger on the subreddit, because marriage is pretty unpopular there. It seems to be dominated by ""pickup"" practicing members (""negging"" is not traditional RP behavior), when I think Athol Kay's take on it has a lot more in common with the kink community.

"No, I think this is something that we as individuals can actually do to make a difference in our own lives, or those lives around us, but I think these victories are artificial, and they don't improve the dynamics of the system.

For example, in San Francisco there are a number of worker-owned and operated enterprises. They are almost exclusively supported by wealthier shoppers. They can survive in the microcosm of San Francisco because there are people here who are willing to spend the extra money to shop at a place with high-quality goods, fair labor standards, etc. Across the street from Rainbow Grocery store is the Food Co, where you go to stock up on Top Ramen packets at a dollar a bushel if you can't afford the organic ones that are two dollars a packet at Rainbow.

My point is, the store does not exist outside of the market dynamic. The reason Wal-Mart replaced hundreds of smaller, locally-owned markets is because it can provide goods at a lower price. This is not a fact that is altered by the internal business practices of the locally-owned market. It does not help them thrive. It does not help to replace the market system of pricing with something better. The only people whose lives are improved are the workers in the market, if they manage to outcompete the capitalist enterprise and survive.

These are battles fought on an individual basis and usually supported by the presence of affluent liberals. I'm unclear on how this is a huge step in the right direction, and on what path it is meant to be taking us."

It's no different to expecting westerners to cover up, if wearing western clothing is offensive to their culture there is no reason we can't interject being fully covered is offensive to ours, which it is. The difference is we're more tolerant than they are.

> Having a voluntary workmans comp system would break down. No businesses would offer it, no matter how many people want it. 

How do you know that no one would offer it if they weren't forced to? There are plenty of businesses that already offer other types of insurance that they aren't legally required to offer. So what makes you think that no one would offer workers' comp without having to be forced to?


Also, even if it were true that no one would offer workers' comp without being forced to, that doesn't explain why you have the right to force them to offer it. Jessica Alba won't have sex with me without being forced to, but that doesn't mean that I have a right to rape her.

I don't have a right to use your home. So can I delegate the right to use your home to my brother? Or is it just a matter of ""popular consent?"" If I get together with 100 other people, none of which have a right to use your home, and most of us agree that my brother should have a right to use your home, can we then properly delegate the right to use your home to my brother without your permission? Are 100 people not enough? What if we had 1,000 people? Or 10,000? Or a million? How many people would I need to give my brother permission to use your home without your consent?

> You're asking me to be your high school Government teacher...basically...

No, because I want you to actually teach me something.

> Do i have to rehash Jon Locke and Thomas Hobbes? Do you understand the concept of The social contract?

""The social contract"" is a completely made up concept. I never signed or agreed to any ""social contract."" The argument is that I'm passively agreeing to it just by living within a certain geographical region. By that same logic, I could make up a contract that says that anyone who breathes oxygen is agreeing to pay me $10 million a year.

Also, even if I were to accept the ridiculous idea that the social contract is in any way legitimate, that still wouldn't explain why the government is justified in enforcing it with violence. If I enter into a contract with someone that says that they agree to paint my house, can I kidnap them and lock them in a cage if they don't paint my house? Can I shoot them if they resist my attempting to kidnap them?

Like you said, your parents can just do the labor themselves. But thats just owners working for free to keep their companies afloat.

> Wow. Sorry, maybe i should have explained that stat better. 68% of all businesses provide healthcare to their employees. Of the businesses with over 50 employees, 94% of them already provide healthcare to their employees. 

There are a lot of businesses with over 50 employees though. So 6% of every business in the country that has over 50 employees is a lot of jobs.

Also, this pretty much proves that your argument that businesses wouldn't provide workers' compensation without being forced to is horse shit. According to your statistics, 68% of businesses provide health insurance without having to be forced to. So why would you think that they wouldn't provide other types of insurance without being forced to?

> You're getting angry over things you dont even understand. Its hilarious.

Not everyone uses or needs health insurance though. Some people go their entire lives without ever having a medical bill that they can't pay out of their own pocket.

> Again, your problem is the constitution. Specifically the 16th amendment. The government can tax your income. Isnt that something you should be outraged over more so than this?

I never said that I wasn't against taxation. You've just taken it upon yourself to assume things about me that you have no basis for assuming.

> *Your* getting angry over when they take your income, its hilarious.

What about my getting angry? Also, didn't you already tell me that I was angry, and that it was hilarious? Do you work for the Department of Redundancy Department?

> If obama had said ""were raising income taxes by 2%, and providing an equivalent tax credit if you buy healthcare"", would these thoughts of tyranny even be popping into your head? 

Well, I doubt that Obama would have said that, because, for one thing, he'd have better grammar than that. Also, he wouldn't have said that for the reason that he didn't say it, and that was that he would have had to acknowledge that he'd broken his promise to not raise taxes on the middle and lower classes. This is just one of many reasons why representative democracy is bullshit. Politicians don't have to keep any of the promises that they make in order to get you to vote for them.

I suppose that you're going to make the argument that we could always vote them out for not keeping their promises, but I don't see how that excuses them lying to get elected in the first place, or the term that we had to endure in which we didn't get what we voted for because they lied.

> Conservative doesnt mean ""stay the same"". Your essentially advocating a return to early 20th century labor laws and the repeal of a lot of vital government regulations.

There is a notable difference in braking distance and other factors with a 20 mph speed difference.

What is your objective ""braking distance"" with regards to campaign finance. By what metric is it completely okay to donate $100 to the ACLU *PAC* but not $200? 

To use the speeding analogy, it seems you are saying the speed limit on the freeway should be 25 mph and not 75 mph. And questioning you is absurd, because it is arbitrary to begin with.

"As for winning affection, though, there's very much a sexist dynamic at work.  In seriousness, how often do you hear about women ""winning"" a guy?  It's more kind of ""he likes you or not"" for a lot of women -- if a guy doesn't like you, there's almost nothing you can do to change that.  Whereas the point of view is traditionally that a woman's not initially liking a man is not an insurmountable obstacle.  It just kind of reinforces the whole men-are-doers-women-are-window-dressing dynamic.

>There is no respect for them at all. A troll wants you to lose disrespect for him/her.

Arguable, but think about how many times you've seen trolling referred to as ""impressive"" or ""successful,"" etc.  There is a kind of grudging respect for trolls, and this bizarre kind of sense that they're somehow off-limits when it's time to apply criticism.  Like ""it's just a troll"" is used as a reason not to criticize something someone said.  That's ridiculous, though -- the fact that someone is intentionally being an asshole is, if anything, *all the more* reason to call them out on it.

>The point I was making by that though, was that it shouldn't be used to say the majority of reddit or men or whatever are sexist.

Actually, I'd say the majority of everyone, everywhere, is sexist, because every civilization I'm familiar with is sexist in at least some ways.

>This is true, but it isn't to the extent people make it out to be

That's kind of a pointless assertion.  What ""people""?  And isn't it possible that they're simply better at recognizing it than you are?

>there is just as much subtle or not sexism against men too.

I absolutely agree there's tons of sexism against men, and just like most sexism against women, it usually doesn't get called out, or people will be called ""whiners"" for calling it out.  All sexism is bullshit, and it's really unfortunate that it pervades and permeates social discourse."
"Well, the slavery one is easy.  Slavery existed.  To change that would require radical social changes.  The best that could be done was to at least control slavery.

Opensecrets.org has the total campaign contributions list and going back 20 years, the Kochs haven't ever broken the top 80. And note that all but 4 (who donate equally to both parties) of the top 17 all favor democrats, but that doesn't fit with your right-wing money narrative either. You should know that a Democrats get far more money than Republicans for most of the election cycles. Its just you selectively choose whom to turn your ire on. If this were really about principle there would threads calling out the Laborers Union, Communication Workers Union, Joiners Union, American Fedn of State, County & Municipal Employees, Realtor's Union, Trial Lawyers Union, Teamsters Union, ActBlue, and Goldman Sachs, all of whom are in the top heavy hitters category and all of whom donate heavily toward Democrats.

And in 26 states, the CU ruling changes nothing. In the other 24, it changes very little. And guess what? I like free speech, so I think any individual or corporation (groups of individuals) should be allowed to spend their money as they see fit.

Your understanding of the CU ruling is flawed, which is precisely why Justice Kennedy mouthed ""not true"" when Obama made the same mistake during the SOTU.

They donated that much just to the ACLU to fight the patriot act. To put that in perspective, Ron Paul raised over 20 million dollars through online donations and none of that came from corporations. All of it came from individual contributions. The Kochs in comparison contributed half that over a period of 20 years. The Kochs are the most inconsequential political boogyman of all time."
"Here's my story.

I used to be an insomniac - a clinically diagnosed one, not just a teenager with poor sleeping habits - so I would be up playing Call of Duty 4 in my room during the wee hours of the morning. I met a guy (not naming anyone, sorry) in a lobby who I got along with really well, and after a few games he invited me to join a private game with him so we could boost each other (yes, I just openly admitted to boosting, but whatever it was years ago and I have since stopped playing games anyway)... so, after a few nights in a row of socializing over xbox live, we finally exchanged myspace, email and phone numbers, etc... and became really good friends. We lived on opposite sides of the world to each other so we never saw each other in real life. I knew this ""guy"" for years. He had his own problems too, and little to my knowledge his problems were becoming a risk to his life.

One day we were online and he told me his girlfriend was pregnant, which was of course a surprise to me and I was really happy for him. He was already a father of a little girl, and this guy was only young (about 21) so I asked him more. That's when he told me the new child wasn't his. He hadn't slept with his girlfriend in months. He broke down over xbox live and I felt horrible, I just wanted to help this guy out. 

The next day, he wasn't online. But I received an email from him telling me he wouldn't be on xbox live anymore, as he had been kicked out by his girlfriend. In that same email, he told me his father had died of cancer hours before the email. He went on to tell me that I was the only person he could tell because he couldn't trust anybody else. His mother was an alcoholic and had disappeared after his fathers death. 

A week later, I was on xbox live, playing Call of Duty 4 in a private lobby with a few of the ""guys"" friends I had met while playing with him. I asked them where he was, and if he was doing okay...

""Oh... didn't anybody tell you? He died man. He hung himself a week ago at his grandparents place""

"supposedly the nine are a race of dark aligned beings but are allied with us and the reef.

recently i saw somewhere that they are or may be humans who were totally altered by the darkness...  though i would consider this to be a slight change/ammendment/retcon to the lore if true because originally it was stated somewhere that the awoken were the farthest the ships fleeing earth were able to get by the time the collapse happened.

the awoken were altered by the darkness partially but not totally because of the outward light from an event or the light of the sun still being strong enough at that distance or whatever no one knows the specifics for sure just that they are a mix of light and dark.

the humans on earth who werent killed during the collapse chain of events are still fully of the light, with guardians able to wield the traveler's light.

the fallen, hive, vex, and cabal are said to be races of the darkness, though this was also stated to be uncertain and postulation because they showed up at or close to the time we were contending with the darkness and because they appeared to want us gone/dead/wiped out.

of those 4 only the hive have been shown to be truly tied to the darkness for certain this far, and there is speculation that is only because of the worm parasites inside them controller them that come from the darkness and need to feed on the light.  the taken being taken from our dimension warped/twisted by the darkness and sent back to fight us being the 2nd confirmed darkness group for certain.

there are signs the fallen used to be good/light oriented and possibly used to be allied with our goldenage ancestors even or traded with them or something...

once we learned more about them, the cabal has always been stated to only be here in the system because they are running from an enemy they are scared of.  presumably this enemy was oryx but we do not know this it could be another enemy or the hive in general or the darkness itself.

the vex were thought to be darkness incarnate and pure evil and according to the exo stranger anyway ""evil so evil it hates other evil""

but now in a mission taking us back to the vault of glass we here a transmission lost to the airwaves of time from the guardian praydeth, who mentions seeing the darkness invading the vault of glass in the past when his fireteam was there fighting them and attacking the vex...so quite possibly the vex werent evil after all or at least weren't dark orginally.

supposedly the nine have been so changed by darkness that the light is immensely painful possibly fatal to them, so they have to send xur to communicate with us

the nine i dont think its been confirmed for sure but its highly believed they are hiding in jupiter or on on a moon of jupiter, saturn could very well be a prison world though, and it is part of the nine's territory as part of the jovians, and they werent happy with the crows doing something on the cauldrons of rhea which was sadi to be on saturn or one of saturn's moons."
"I see! So it's no affront to your ideology for communism to exist, then go away, then exist again, as circumstances change. That makes me a little less confused. However, I would like to share some thoughts on post-scarcity, which seems to be a rather crucial pillar of support for communism as I understand it.

There cannot be a sustained population of humans that does not produce more food than they need. This is because food production fluctuates, and the sustained population is limited to what can be supported by the lower bound. The average food production will always be higher than the lower bound, and since fluctuations in food production are quite significant, it will be significantly higher. If post-scarcity is defined as producing a lot more of the stuff we require to live than we need, then all agrarian societies have been 'post scarcity'... right up until something happens that significantly reduces food output. 

The kind of things that could and did significantly reduce food output in historical societies are *not* things that we have ""gotten over"" in modern society. Resource depletion and natural disasters, which have historically taken the 'post' out of post scarcity many a time, are still very much modern problems. 

My biggest stumbling block for accepting communism is this requirement of a world that is truly post-scarcity - which does NOT just mean we are producing more than we need. It should mean that we can sustainably, reliably produce more than we need given any scenario that is likely to present itself. And it seems to me that *getting to that world* is far far FAR more important an objective than trying to convince people about what economic system we should have once we get there. "

This is why you have to be very careful medicating someone for their mood. He was on Ritalin and Prozac, and he definitely did not need either of them.

Giving him the SSRI relieved him of any lows and promoted his manic behavior -- not to mention the amphetamine (Ritalin) amping him up."

"1) Don't panic. This is the single most important step. Heal based on priority. Tank needs to be standing. You need to be standing. Next is everyone having enough HP to survive the next mechanic if they do it correctly. Next is a buffer for if they do it incorrectly (should that be feasible). *Remember that people don't need full HP all the time.* HP is a resource, use it.Remember that your heals over time (Medica II, Regen) aren't doing anything when the target is at full HP, let it do your work for you when you can. Your other priority is your MP. You can't heal anyone if you panic, spam Medica II (never do this), and brick your MP.

2) Don't panic. This is the single most important step. PVP is a completely different bag of tricks than PVE. Crowd control matters, healers are tanks, tanks are support, and DPS have a deathwish.

"I read *The Red Queen* quite a few years ago. It's not a *bad* book, but it's very much pop science for people who haven't taken a science class since high school (and may or may not have passed). It's not a rigorous look at well, anything. It's also around 20 years old now- some of it is outdated.

If you want a rigorous analysis of the research in sex differences, I strongly recommend Cordelia Fine's *Delusions of Gender*. It's written by an academic psychologist and is a surprisingly fun read. She debunks much of the research on sex differences.

To answer your title question, there are two types of sex differences:

1. Biological, inherited, innate differences

2. Learned, socially influenced differences

There's also a third type (sort-of) which are sex differences commonly believed to exist, but that don't actually.

Feminists don't deny that there are any differences in 1. Men (on average) are larger and stronger, for instance. However, it's very important to remember those key words *on average*. Average differences aren't terribly useful when we're talking about individual people.

As for 2, yeah, we mostly want to change them (for the better).

For argument's sake, let's say that women are innately bad at reading maps- this is an inherited trait and it is due to brain differences that occur before birth. (I will also say here that some of the science about spatial reasoning differences is iffy, but we can ignore that for now). If you look at toys given to boys and girls, do you think we are increasing or decreasing the difference in visuospatial skills between men and women? Even if we show that the difference is innate, can we be sure that *all* of the difference is innate? Studies show that spatial reasoning can change and can even change the brain as a result, btw. (There's a famous study that looked at London cab drivers' brains- you might want to check it out)

So rather than focus on what the differences are and potentially using them to justify or deny discrimination against women, we should focus on changing what we can.

What I'm getting at, is many differences are due to 2, and many are due to a combination of 1 and 2. There's also a lot of *really* bad science out there about sex differences- the not-really-a-category that is group 3 is pretty big. There's also a ton of differences that people think are in category 1 but actually belong in category 2.

tl;dr: A lot of things that people think are genetic aren't. Some genetic differences are further amplified by society. Very, very few feminists deny that there are *any* differences between the sexes. If you want to learn about sex differences, find a better book than *The Red Queen*."
"If you're arguing that it's God's choice as to what you choose, then yes, that's determinism.

If you believe the only difference between those universes is the beginning state, which God chooses, then you're arguing for determinism.

If the decider of which universe it will be is *you*, then you have free will.  God could create that universe, and could even know the future of said universe, but you would be the one choosing.

But if you try and say ""then God could choose a universe where I make a different choice,"" then you're taking the choice back out of your hands."

That an investor chooses to fund companies that he/she perceived as likelier to succeed isn't ""calling the shots in the economic realm,"" it's ""calling the shots on *their own money*,"" which they should have every right to do.

>...but now they call the shots in the political realm, too.

I don't necessarily disagree, but my preferred solution is to minimize the government to responsibility over a few key areas and never let it beyond that - the wealthy are attracted to influence government because if they don't, their competitors will.

The government is power.  People who possess power aren't going to let another powerful organization trample over them with nary a peep, they're going to make sure that they emerge from the government's acting in the best way possible.  You want them to stop influencing government?  Then get the government out of micromanaging the economy.

Please show a source on that claim, because I think you are frankly pulling that out of your ass.  A significant portion of society is concerned about this, I think I have demonstrated evidence as such from multiple sources. If you choose to ignore it you simply are deliberately being ignorant.

> True. Unfortunately, if most shared your bias, law enforcement could not function at all. You could have police do something, but not actually enforce laws, with the assumption that no use of force by police is ever justified.

I never said no use of force is unjustified, that is a ridiculous. There is an established line. Some officers have been known to cross it in the past without nearly as much scrutiny and persecution as is occurring today. I welcome body cameras, and cell phone videos. I think it will protect the police and suspects. I still do think there are a great many mean of deescalating some situations where to the point where force is unnecessary, but some officers do deliberately not choose that course. 

> Can you find a story on a police use of force that does not deliberately leave details vague to create an impression not backed up by facts? See the LA Times article above, and avoidance of mentioning the specific detail that the police officers claiming to have administered CPR apparently arrived after the end of the video.

I suspect I can easily do so by linking to any number of sources, but you will likely find a issue with it as you seem to think there is a conspiracy against the truth in the “media”, and being unsure of what your stipulations for that are, I feel it would likely be a painful waste of time for the both of us. 

> Yet you left out the same critical details in describing both as media outlets had.

I was not aware I was required to described them to you in full detail, and that is what was expected. I mentioned them by name only initially,  You are wrote up short blurbs about them that left out plenty of important details. 

> Not in the 4:51 of video i linked to. He stated that he was dragged. He did not state that was before he fired.

He never stated that he waiting until after the car was in motion to fire.


“Officer Tensing stated that he almost was run over by the driver of the Honda Accord and was forced to shoot the driver with his duty weapon (Sig Sauer P320). Officer Tensing stated that he fired a single shot. Officer Tensing repeated that he was being dragged by the vehicle and had to fire his weapon”
http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/ucomm/docs/incident-report.pdf

So, I will ask again what was the reason for shooting at the suspect?

> Then you have never actually read the relevant case law

I am familiar with Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor. While only time and the courts will truly decide, and with the evidence I have seen, I strongly feel that neither the Walter Scott case or the Samuel Dubose case reach the threshold for the use of deadly force. The prosecutors that brought charges against the officers likely agree also. But I suppose you chalk that up to them just sacrificing good cops up for the publicity.

> Possible, but so far all we have are several articles on the same anonymous ""report"" given to the prosecutor's office. There is no indication whether anyone names in that statement corroborated those claims when asked for a formalized statement.
Another good example of selectively omitting relevant details.

Did you even read the article I linked to? It discussed a 2009 Tulsa County Sheriff's Department report given to NBC news. These are not anonymous sources, and officers are named who made the complaints regarding the special treatment for Bates. According to the Tulsa sheriffs department the report release was not authorized, but it did not deny the report was legitimate. 

> The two most detrimental trends, in my opinion, feed off of one another: the focus on liability avoidance over actual job performance, and the focus on reducing fear of crime, rather than attempts at reducing actual crime, even where that endangers people by creating an unrealistic perception of risk.

So what do you think could be done to solve these problems?

"Couple points missing in the article:

1)  China criminalized philanthropy by nonprofits until only recently.  Grassroots giving was illegal until this decade.  For many years, the only ""charitable"" organizations allowed in China were supposed to be government run by the Communist Party.

2)  Even after the laws against private philanthropic organizing was loosened back in 2004, it was still illegal to raise funds publicly.  This is one of many other stupid restrictions.

3)  Even if you can get around these laws, the historical impact has still been devastating.  A lot of well meaning socially-ambitious citizens have been frustrated at the difficulties in organizing, because the financial, organizational, and logistical expertise and infrastructure necessary to erect and sustain them has been nonexistent due to the lack of prior philanthropic operations to follow and imitate.

However, that is of course all improving gradually.  There's a new middle class today.  Philanthropic projects have been starting up, and total donations by the top donors has of course accelerated since it was first made non-illegal.

Of course, this doesn't explain why those billionaires didn't want to donate at the Bill Gates dinner.

You would not find this situation in ANY other NFL city. None. People aren't having a Jameis Winston/Mike Glennon debate. Guess what? Mike Glennon gives the Bucs a better chance to win, but who the fuck wants to watch Mike Glennon more? Nobody.

People think that this debate is over ""Johnny love"" and its not. Its about fan love who is tired of seeing the Browns as unwatchable and when they have something to be hopeful for, like all awful teams get occasionally, its wasted away on the bench. Thats human (fan) nature. EVERY fan of a team who has a 1st round draft pick on a mediocre team wants to see the young guy. Thats 100% normal. 

Whats not normal is what is happening in Cleveland, the DISLIKE of that young QB. This debate continues because there are people who DONT want Manziel. We are having these angry debates not because of the normal people who are excited for Manziel but because of the oddity which is the people who dont care to ever see their young QB.

No young QB would be treated like this in any other city BUT Cleveland. Its absurd. Can't even get a ""Young Exciting Heisman Trophy Winning 1st Round Pick vs Josh McCown"" decision right. 

I don't think anyone on here has any clue how pathetic the Browns look to unbiased observers around the league today. Clueless organization. 

Browns being Browns.

"I've never written here before but I love Japan and here are my thoughts:

1) Central defense is a problem. Yoshida hasn't turned into the rock I thought he would after watching him at the Olympics, but I don't think he was particularly bad at the World Cup. Konno, on the other hand, needs to be replaced. He's always been physically limited (like many others on this team) but now he also seems less focused. The challenge for the penalty today was madness and he was sloppy with the ball at his feet. I don't know of any dominant, mean central defenders but hopefully some will make their name soon.

2) The midfield is too easily out-muscled. I think Japan has some of the most technically gifted players in the world but when the holding midfield is comprised of Hasebe/Endo and Yamaguchi/Aoyama, there are naturally going to be problems keeping possession. I think the midfield did a remarkable job of passing it around and keeping the ball against Greece and Colombia but Hasebe and Yamaguchi were overrun on a few too many occasions. If only there was a mean, strong henchman in there too. I'd sacrifice some technical skills if it meant some solidity in front of the backline.

3) No creativity in the final third. The plan seemed to be play it to Nagatomo or Uchida and see if they can put in some good crosses. This was maddening against Greece where anyone could see they were going to win everything in the air. They had to try something else and for some reason they didn't. At the same time...

4) Hesitancy in front of goal. When we attacked, the players seemed focus on getting the best possible look at goal instead of taking shots when available. There were a couple occasions when someone would have space in front of the box and would refuse to shoot, instead playing it out wide for Uchida or Nagatomo.

5) When we did get chances, the finishing was poor. This is more of form thing but I do think we need some more natural finishers in the team.

6) Coaching. Endo as a sub clearly won't work and yet that's what we saw against Greece. Kakitani for two minutes at the end is not enough. But that's what we got. Zaccheroni's adjustments didn't do anything, and what's even more frustrating was that it was clear they wouldn't do anything before he made them.

Something happened with this Japan team two years ago. I watched a match they played in the summer of 2011 against South Korea. They were so good that I thought if they played like this in the World Cup, they could make the semifinals. Then a couple months later, they lost to North Korea and something seemed to change. The team hasn't improved like they should have since then. I would argue that they've regressed. At this World Cup, today against Colombia was the only match I can say I was happy with the performance.

I'm grateful for what Zaccheroni has done for this team but it's time for him to go. He's too loyal to his old guard and hasn't introduced enough youngsters. His in-game management is infuriating at times. The team selection from game to game is mystifying. I don't know who we can get but someone who trusts youth and is committed to the possession football that we can play so well is a must."

>It really should be such a basic understanding, and your lack of that scares me.


What should be a basic understanding? This particular part of the story was written poorly, and the reasons they attempted to give to justify it fall apart, which is what i've been pointing out. 


Oh look, more condescension. My ""lack of understanding."" It scares you? Really? You getting spooked by this conversation?


>I mean, just take a look at how far Naruto went for Gaara after having just one encounter. He saw something in him, and would go to the ends of the world to save him, if need be.


Yes, he saw himself in Gaara, so he wanted to save him. I get that. They're similar. Naruto and Sasuke are less similar however, and not only do they push the whole ""Naruto and Sasuke are similar, the most similar, look at how opposite and equal they are"" (which falls apart when they are more similar to other characters), they also attempt to state how they are best friends, which also falls apart, because their friendship was not developed. It's poor writing.



>I find it really childish almost, that you're insistent that ""no no, Naruto and Sasuke NEED to be best friends in every visual way otherwise it doesn't make sense to me!"".


Oh look, personal insults. Why do you feel the need to personally insult me? Insulting the other person in an argument does nothing to support your side, and only hurts it. 


Also, I don't see how you strawmanning my argument helps you either. I never said they need to be best friends in every visual way. I'm saying they need to be shown to develop as friends, which they never were. There was one main mission they were on together, then the Chunin exams, and then Sasuke turned bad. There was very little development in their relationship. 



>I also don't recall ever hearing Naruto explicitly state that Sasuke is his best friend.


He says it pretty explicitly here
So that's false.


>Why would it not make sense for Gaara to up and leave his village to chase after and talk to Sasuke while simultaneously avoiding the Akatsuki and being Kage? Uhh... because major plot holes?


I don't think I said Gaara should chase after Sasuke, I didn't even compare the two, I compared Gaara & Naruto and Sasuke & Neji. But, what plot holes? I mean, if Kishimoto decided to have Gaara and Sasuke share some connection and be friends for some reason, what plot holes would cause Gaara to not chase after him? Because the Akatski were after him? The Akatski were after Naruto too, yet he left the village traveling with Jiraya. If they really wanted Naruto, they could've sent more than 2 Akatski members, and he would be caught. Because he's Kazekage? Again, if Kishimoto wanted Gaara to chase after Sasuke, I doubt he would've made him Kazekage.


Regardless, I'm not saying Gaara or Neji should've chased after Sasuke, I'm saying both explanations they give for Naruto being close to Sasuke (being best friends and sharing pains) are poorly presented, making that plot have less emotional weight. It would hold more weight if they were actually developed as friends.



>It's not ""IF naruto has the Kyuubi and can talk to Sasuke then Gaara can talk to Sasuke because he has the Sanbi"" That is a logical fallacy. 


I never said that ""IF naruto has the Kyuubi and can talk to Sasuke then Gaara can talk to Sasuke because he has the Sanbi"". Not once. I compared Gaara to Naruto, and Neji to Sasuke, but again, the point of that was not to say they should all be chasing each other around. I'm saying the explanation of ""Only they can reach out because Naruto understands Sasuke's pain and vice versa"" holds no weight when its blatantly false.


>You're suggesting a proposition without considering the facts that go along with it. AKA personality, compatibility, the VILLAGE they live in, etc.


Again, I wasn't suggesting a proposition, merely pointing out bad writing. But you bring up a good point, personality. Both Gaara and Neji share a much more similar personality with Sasuke than Naruto. Gaara even points out how Sasuke shares the same look. And yes, compatibility. Naruto and Sasuke weren't shown to be compatible; in fact, they hated each other. Now, its okay to start out a relationship that way, but it wasn't properly developed from hate to friendship, even though that's what they said happened.


>I don't think they tried hard to make it seem like Naruto and Sasuke has this ""Mysterious, deep, unique, bestest relationship evar""


Yes they did. Sasuke has to kill Naruto to get the MS, because Naruto is his best friend, and he needs to kill his best friend to get them. It was such a forced, contrived way to cause conflict and get them to fight. Naruto explicitly states ""only I can handle all of that hatred"", again attempting to show how special their relationship is. They state how similar they were, how they were both lonely orphans and ostracized (even though Sasuke wasn't; again, forced similarities), and how as kids, they almost were friends, which they only brought up long after, in the middle of battle, to attempt to make the moment have more emotional weight, when it just seems forced and unnatural.


>Sasuke (who was popularly assumed a homicidal maniac)


When? Who thought he was a homicidal maniac, before he was? I on;y recall the older ninja praising him and saying how strong he'll grow up to be, and how he'll be a hero if he takes out Itachi.


>They pieced together the flashbacks to portray Naruto as that annoying, determined kid we grew to love, and Sasuke (who was popularly assumed a homicidal maniac) as a traumatized, hateful and mainly sad kid who tried to lie to himself by saying that he needed and wanted no one. It is about the characters, and their development. 


That's the problem, it wasn't developed well, it was developed poorly. They threw that in long after they should've, putting it in the middle of a big clash to attempt to make it seem more emotional, when it was really clear these backstories were only thought of now. 


>Not this fantasy bond that stems from romance novels. Not this ""deep"" relationship.


The story clearly attempts to focus on the relationship. I'm not saying whether they should or not, I'm saying they should've done it well, which they didn't.


In short, Naruto and Sasuke's friendship is a poorly thought-out, poorly developed plot, and yet is forced to the forefront of the story, which further exposes its weak, shaky base. The main focus of a story should be thoroughly developed, and this wasn't. It's even clearer when they attempt to develop it with flashbacks and reincarnation talk, which just further shows how shallow it is. If they really wanted to develop it later on, they should've developed it in real-time, not flashback thoughts."
"Pubs only apply largely to Germanic and Celtic countries. In regards to your list of places, the Netherlands will be filled with pubs in places (please stop with calling the place Holland - its like calling Japan ""Kanto"") yet France, Spain and Italy are the places where cafes are more common.

The drinks are likely to be expensive, the music is likely to give you tinitus and I've heard of horror stories where some bouncers will look for a fight if it means they think they'll look chivalrous to a girl standing nearby. 

Pubs on the other hand aren't quite as intense. Either alone or in a group, its simply a matter of walking in, finding a table and ordering a drink. Its not pleasant if you don't drink alcohol, but these places always sell lemonade and cola if thats your preference.

"Capitalism and so private property would be eliminated by the state during socialism. In communism business owners wouldn't need to be suppressed as the idea of owing a business and basically engaging in capitalism would have been illegal for decades if not more and it would not be possible to get people to work for you if they don't need to to live comfortably. 

Resources would likely be managed and distributed by an organisation such as a politburo. This would originally be part of the state but once the state becomes unnecessary it would be turned over to be organised and run by society for society and thus the criteria would be internally set. 

As for creating a post scarcity society, we're already getting there. A look at global production statistics will show you that we already overproduce a lot of the thing we need. this coupled with increased automation and the ever march forward in science will lead to a future where very little work is needed to fulfil all the needs of the global population.  

As for corruption in a "" a single authoritative institution""  I agree. ultimately statism is flawed this is why communists suggest a stateless society, yes there is the potential for corruption whilst we get there but it's simply a case of the means being justified for the results. 

Having corruption for a short while and achieving a incorruptible system is better than taking the ""lesser"" evil and never making any progress to try and stop it.       "

"There are 4 types of scoring possible :

1. Try -  5 points, when you reach your opponent's ""end line"", similar to a touchdown. However the player must ground the ball for it to be a valid try. 

2. Conversion - 2 points. Only possible after scoring a try, when a player takes a mandatory kick at the posts. 

3. Drop goal - 3 points, possible during play, this is when a player successfully kicks at goal during play. The player must bounce the ball on the ground before kicking otherwise it is not a valid drop goal. 

4. Penalty - 3 points. When the opposing team is penalised, one is offered some choices, one of which is an attempt at the posts. The player must then mount the ball on the ground, and can then kick at the posts. 

Hope this made sense!

It's hard to say what a typical score is in Rugby, as there are often quite high scoring games for both teams, and other times when teams don't score too much. However, any game where teams end within a margin of 7 points or so, is generally considered a very close game. If a team lost by more than 20 points, it's considered a thrashing.

First... Well, I'm sorry, but he will be one of the last heroes to be added :( I'm thinking Invoker, then Meepo, then Rubick, are the hardest/longest ones implementation-wise =/

Also, I don't know where I said that, but don't expect too much x) I mean, it'd be nice to paint all his particles green, for example, but that brings its own set of problems (it's probably a net nerf), even though it looks cool, and will probably be more work than it's worth.

About his abilities:

Spell Steal working on allies is *fucking huge*. I know it worked like this on Source 1 IMBA, but you have to think of all sorts of gamebreaking stuff you can do with it - mainly quadra [insert big ult here] stuff, like 4x black hole or RP, and all sorts of permadisabling.

I think if this makes it into the game, it'll be gated behind an aghs scepter. Maybe even an aghs soul. I really have to think better about it.

Zero-cooldown/manacost spell steal will be a thing for sure. Also stolen spells lasting forever (bar death). Probably level 1 spell steal, as well.

Telekinesis should be able to bring the controlled target further, also possibly lift up a # of targets in an AOE around the main target, and deal landing damage to nearby enemies.

Fade bolt will for sure go on forever, with a larger bounce radius, and reduce %-based damage on enemies. Possibly ALL damage, not only physical - depends on how his other abilities turn out.

Null field will have some kind of *counterspell* mechanic - possibly passive, possibly activated. Many have suggested something akin to lotus orb - another possibility is to have a dedicated, extra spell slot which stores the last spell cast around rubick (or ON rubick), which he can then freely use.

She handled the situation fine and didn't need anyone to rescue her. That is AWESOME. She didnt need someone to save her.... He needed someone to put him in his place. 

Edit: Okay. i understand that theres nothing wrong with taking precautions. My point was that this thread was about your most satisfying ""no"". On everyone elses comments about quitting smoking or getting emancipated or whatever else, people responded by saying ""nice!"", ""great job"", ""I know the feeling, dude!""..... but when this girl shared that her favorite ""no"" was when she said no to sexual harassment, the first comment was ""you should've had someone else do it for you."" .... I'm not saying that you shouldn't take precautions. Im saying that maybe we should acknowledge that what she did was awesome and that more people should do it. Personally, I feel like some boys (and girls) don't back off because they are not hearing the word NO. We tell people that they need to be passive and find a way out of a situation like that by relying on other people. It's not a bad thing to rely on other people,but its also not a bad thing to encourage someone to stick up for themselves in that kind of a situation/ applaud them when they do. 
   Also, a lot of people have mentioned on here that these kinds of people, in this case a sober male, know that what they are doing is wrong. Although I'm sure that they have some sense of whats right and wrong... they don't always know where the line is and when theyre over stepping it.

We do need to teach people that yes means yes and no means no. In some cases, I think that situations like this could be avoided if we made more of an effort to teach this to young boys and girls.

"Its a good point, though i believe the point of the original graphic, even though misleading, was probably to encourage more women to report their rapes. I do know of a lot of girls who were raped and didn't report them, because anything other than stranger in a dark alley becomes 'he says, she says'. So I would have some doubts, if a large number of reports were recanted, does not necessarily mean it never happened, more so that the pressure of trial was just not worth it.

False rape claims are really serious and need to stop, but since I know women who have suffered, I hate the fact they think no one believe them."

"So United are not very happy that our academy has become the much more enticing one to parents and players, and as a result, we demolished them across every age group, the highlight being the 9-0 at u14s.

United are pissed off about our ""zealous"" recruiting of local players, which is incredibly ironic because we're doing exactly what SAF did. When he first arrived at United he made it his business to topple our youth system, which was better at the time and make sure they got all the players in the region. He recognised the importance of getting the best intot he academy and Giggs and Butt are two who old City fans will always be furious that united ""poached"" - but in reality it was good work done by them and now our management has placed the same focus on the academy.

This is following hot on the heels of the rather embarassing image released by the FA last week about which clubs supplied England youth players..

As you can see United's academy is not producing what it once was - and the former academy director Brian McClair hasn't been replaced yet so the whole set up is a bit of a shambles compared to in Ferguson's day.

So now they're considering not playing us at youth levels!

As Rory Smith has said on his twitter after posting this (check out his twitter feed, but I can't link atm) - our youth set-up is quite widely known to be the best at least in the north now, and the emphasis on education has made it very desirable to parents who want to know their kids will have something to fall back on if they don't make it.

Especially because the kids' private education is paid for even if the kids get cut from the youth set up.

"Meh...I used to do the ghostblade build about 3 months ago?

From lol wiki:

An alternate formula for calculating the number of shots fired is 13 / 15 / 17 (+1 per 20.9% / 17.4% / 14.9% AS).

So not sure where you're getting 4 more shots from. 

Culling shots don't crit. It's ~350 more damage from 3 shots.

The culling is also unreliable. We've all seen clips of pros completely whiffing it or the enemy just flashing. Yeah it's great for duelling with 20 flat armor penn. Ghostblade itself is great for duelling but it's less reliable on champs like Lucian. Master Yi for example has the benefit that he can activate ult + ghostblade and then close more distance with his Q. Lucian ghostblade + dash won't matter to a caitlyn net, or vayne condemn. Twitch can use it because he stealths right next to you and there's nothing you can do.

Ghostblade also changes your play psychologically to rely more on the culling for damage rather than just abilities + AAing and pros like Rekkless have shown that a standard build of BT PD LW IE works fine on him.

So in short, the problems with ghostblade really are just reliability and it will lack DPS of late game compared to PD and if you're not going to build a defensive item you're VERY prone to throwing the game for your team.

Trin is great for its reliability and it's just as good of a duelling item because of health+sheen procs for ~180 by the time you finish it.

Like I said...I'm a diamond lucian main so I've been running the numbers on every build I can think of (I even looked at the cutlass IE zephyr genja build lol). IMO one of the best and underrated Lucian builds pre patch was BT, Greaves, IE. Your 1 spell combo without culling would wreck any AD and he has waveclear with Q + W so he doesn't need AS like vayne might."

This is a myth whose role is to explain the other myth that Berbers are European or more European looking than Arabs. There is no reason to think, if there is a documented vandal ancestry, that the so called Arabs in the Maghreb don't have vandal ancestry as well.

It's doubtful that the Vandals mixed much with Berbers, they stayed at most one century, and limited themselves to the port cities. While Vandal ancestry is possible, its extent or effect on ethnicity is negligible.

"6. I’m not sure anyone knew if left tackle Jermon Bushrod would be able to gut it out for four quarters.

His back issue is one that is going to be monitored all season and it’s not going to be a surprise if he gets time off during the week each week. He’s probably a good bet to be on the injury report much of the season, if not the entire year. But he’s a pro and he is determined to be out there. The Bears probably left more than any other direction in the running game too and he did well. That’s a positive sign when you talk about a major question mark facing the offense.

7. The last we saw of defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff he was hobbled pretty bad with a walking boot and crutches on his way out of Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati after the third preseason game. Here’s some good news: Ratliff was moving pretty good in the locker room last week and it’s possible he’s ready to play after his three-game suspension is up the day after the Week 3 game at Seattle.

That’s his goal and Ratliff has been arriving in the training room by 6 a.m. almost every day to get treatment for an injury that had him pretty concerned leaving Cincinnati.

“It felt pretty bad but it’s recovering nicely and they’re doing an awesome job here,” Ratliff said. “There are no complaints. I am just doing my work every day and working until I get back. I get a head start on the treatment (because of the suspension). I can really treat it aggressively. I am hoping (to play in Week 4 vs. Oakland) but I am just taking it one day at a time. That is definitely the goal.” 

NFL rules used to prohibit suspended players from being at the team’s facility during their penalty. In many cases, they can now attend meetings and get treatment. Ratliff simply cannot practice (or play) while suspended.

8. Another injured player to keep an eye on soon is cornerback Tracy Porter. He pulled a hamstring in training camp and then tweaked it again in the preseason game at Cincinnati but says he has been progressing nicely and didn’t rule out being ready for the Cardinals next week.

Porter has a long history of injuries, one general manager Ryan Pace knows well from New Orleans. He’s also played for John Fox in Denver where he was injured but it’s what Pace and Fox remember about him when healthy that has kept him around. When Porter went out, he was running with the starters in the nickel package and that is something to keep in mind. 

“They trust and know me,” Porter said. “It’s not anything I would expect to be prolonged or carry on. I’ve been making good headway on it and I am hopeful for next week.”

9. The Bears will want to thank Cardinals general manager Steve Keim and his scouting staff for safety Harold Jones-Quartey and the job they did finding him when Arizona comes to town Sunday. The Bears claimed Jones-Quartey off waivers from the Cardinals after final cuts. He was an undrafted rookie from the University of Findlay, a Division II school in Ohio. Jones-Quartey made a tackle on special teams and the hope is he can help out special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers this season.

Jones-Quartey didn’t even play high school football at Horizon Science Academy in Columbus, Ohio. The school was so small it didn’t have a team so he played football for the Columbus Crusaders, a Christian organization.

“We basically just played football for fun and all that stuff,” Jones-Quartey said. “I wasn’t expecting to get a scholarship. I just wanted to keep playing football as long as I could and it just kind of took off for me.”

After playing at Findlay, he attended the Miami of Ohio pro day and that is where Cardinals scout Luke Palko saw him run well. Arizona wound up inviting him as a tryout player to its rookie minicamp. The Cardinals were full on their roster with defensive backs but he played so well, they made room for him on the 90-man roster. From there, he made plays in preseason. Six tackles in the opener against the Chiefs. An interception in the second game against the Chargers. Five tackles against the Raiders. Two tackles and a fumble recovery against the Broncos. If the Cardinals weren’t so deep at the position, he might have made the 53-man roster.

“I was a little surprised when they released me but I wasn’t bummed,” Jones-Quartey said. “I thought I had a good preseason and I thought I had a great chance of being picked up by someone because I performed pretty well. I just really wanted to play football. This is definitely a blessing and I am going to run with it.”

10. The Bears finally opened the locker room at Halas Hall to media this past week and once again players were grouped together by their positions. That’s the way it was during the Dick Jauron and Lovie Smith era before Marc Trestman mixed things up and moved players all around. The idea was to force players who might not always socialize and get to know one another to do just that.

“The theory is in sound and that’s what I did in college (University of Nebraska) where the coaching staff wanted to intermingle positions and intermingle races,” left guard Matt Slauson said. “So, I get that. But in the professional world there are some things you have to talk about after meetings are done so everybody is on the same page. And when our center was over here and our left tackle was over there and I was way over there, well now I’ve got to take time out of me getting ready (for practice) to go walk over here to talk to (the center) and then walk over there to talk to (the left tackle). Now, I can just do that while I am getting dressed. So it’s much easier.” 

And much more professional. Treat professionals like professionals. They are there to work not look for their latest BFF.

10a. The Bears terminated the contract of outside linebacker Sam Acho, who was sidelined with an illness since before the third preseason game Aug. 29 at Cincinnati. The Bears declined to offer any specifics on Acho’s illness and I’ve never seen a team hit with sickness like I have this team. Quarterback David Fales was sidelined for virtually all of training camp after he fell ill a week before the team reported to Bourbonnais. Then, tight end Chris Pantale was sidelined with an illness for at least two weeks during training camp before he was part of the team’s first wave of cuts. That’s three players missing major chunks of time with illnesses. It’s possible Acho, who looked to carve out a role for himself as a core special teams player, could return. He was spotted at Halas Hall on Friday so it’s not like he’s been too far under the weather to be around teammates.

10b. Had not seen first-round draft pick Kevin White since surgery but he did pop his head into the locker room on Friday. White was getting around with the use of one crutch. Consider him out for the season until further notice. 

10c. One of the reasons the Bears signed cornerback Alan Ball was because of his size and ability to get his long arms on wide receivers at the line of scrimmage. Ball missed the part about getting his hands on wide receivers against the Packers. He’s going to need to get better or opponents will be throwing the ball his direction a lot.

10d. Since the Bears called Bruce Arians and told him Marc Trestman would be the coach of the Bears in 2013, he’s 22-11 in the regular season with the Cardinals. Arians didn’t interview in Arizona until the Bears told him no when he was holed up in a hotel room near Halas Hall.

10e. The Cardinals opened as a 2.5-point favorite over the Bears this week at Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas.

10f. Fox has assigned the broadcast team of Thom Brennaman, Charles Davis and Tony Siragusa to work this coming Sunday’s game against the Cardinals at Soldier Field.

10g. Went out to see some prep football on Friday at Glenbard East where former Bears and Northwestern wide receiver D’Wayne Bates was hired as athletic director. His team is 3-0 for the first time since 1999. "

Then I tried out a bit of pool running, to see how comfortable it would be for the ham (it was perfect! Didn't feel a thing) and had a nice chat with an elderly lady who was also pool running. She was super-impressed that I was pool running without a floatation belt. I guess she might become my new running buddy.

Then I decided that since I can't run, I might as well eat all the chocolate. (More endorphines, right?)

"1. I dont think religeous people are feeble minded, i think they are just naive and refuse to accept something that they dont want to.

2. Honestly i havn't properly investigated why. But i think it would have something to do with the feeling of safety. In one mindset, knowing that as of now, there is no evidence, although highly likely that there is any other living organism in the universe. So knowing its just here on this floating rock in the middle of nowhere could be quite unsettling if you look at it that way. So having a relationship with what you think is the creater of it all would make you feel more secure about eveything on the whole, but again, that is just one mindset.

3. Believe it or not, i dont really know any hardcore fundies. I used to know a boy in school whose father was the school priest, and he was a pretty devout catholic, but that was when i was younger and didnt really care about it as long as it didnt affect me. But what was interesting, was when prayer time came around, many of the non-religous people would pray, or atleast close there eyes and and bow their heads as to go along with everyone else, and being a part of something and accepted is something we crave as human beings, so that might have something to do with it.

"A progressive tax is defined as a tax that changes with an increase in income. 0% tax from $0-$50k and 14.5% for $50k on up is an increase in tax with an increase in income. This is by definition a progressive tax plan with two tiers. If his tax plan said 14.5% for everyone than it would be a flat rate tax. 

The rich currently pay less than 14.5% in tax due to the absurd amount of tax breaks they can take. Taking away those tax breaks and setting a 14.5% tax for everything over $50k will lower everyone's taxes except for the rich. The rich will be forced to pay 14.5% as opposed to the 4-8% often seen that they get after tax loopholes and breaks. "

I should say that personally, I don't buy that you can't just be agnostic. My view is that there is just as much probability of a god or gods existence as there is of their non-existence, so I classify myself as a plain old agnostic, without the trappings.

"This struck a chord with me. Drunk moms are not awesome. Some moms might be jovial drunks, quirky drunks, hilarious drunks, whatever. Some moms may be, my mom isn't.

There is a kind of double-standard when it comes to drunk parents. Someone saying ""drunk dads are awesome"" would almost certainly incite at least a couple of ""not until they beat you"" replies from reddit. Someone replying ""no they aren't"" to drunk moms is being down voted.

Here's the thing. My dad is an awesome drunk. I like drinking with my dad, it's a ball. My mom is an abusive alcoholic. She would drink all day, every day, shit herself, all over the house and break all my stuff out of some misplaced sense of spite. She would abuse me, my father, my siblings and my cats and my dogs both physically and verbally. I am a male. My mother would beat me, until I grew large enough to set her straight - the verbal abuse, the blackmail, the rest of it I had to wait until I was old enough to move out. My father never raised a finger towards us kids, he was supportive, trying to help us understand why mother was like this. He wouldn't hit her either, he would sit there and take unbelievable amounts of physical/emotional shit from his wife. My folks are both well-educated, well-employed, upper-class folk. When her drinking problem got out of hand it became very hard to speak out. Everyone is very sympathetic about a drunk, abusive, father in the house. Speaking about your stepford-wife beating you is a lot harder than speaking of a stereotypical trailerdad beating his kids. The cops wouldn't even take it seriously back then. When she physically attacked my little brother we had him sent to a ""young boys home"" or whatever for his own protection. Lets just say growing up sucked a lot of the time.

Anyway, years later. I patched things up with my mother. She's on (off?) the wagon. But after all these years I can tell instantly if she's had even a single drink. Even when she's not drunk, a single drink in her and fun flies out the window. I get the worst feeling in the world in my gut. I feel like running away. I cannot spend any time in the same building as her. I just leave. I have my own life now. I don't need her shit. She can get back to me when she hasn't had a single drink in another 12 months.

Drunk moms are not fun."

Also, there's a reason that it's harmful. Watching CP encourages child sexual abuse, it doesn't matter if you're not physically hurting children because you support and encourage other people to. Same with any other ""non-physical outlet"", it still normalizes and encourages child abuse.

As for your first question: jealousy is an emotion. Emotions aren't usually rational. You can't prevent emotions from occurring. You /can/ control your reactions to having said emotions. You brought your concerns to your wife, and she led the conversation with the group. If I were her, I would not have done so if I didn't think there was a chance your intuition was correct. ""Irrational"" things you could have done would be to ban her from the group, or to confront these people yourself.

"The year is 2017, multiple Iranian nuclear sites go online, Israel pressures the UN and NATO to intervene and prevent them from building weapons.  After talks break down with no evidence of Iran building weapons, Israel orders air strikes on Iranian enrichment sites, power plants, and select military installations.  There are fairly heavy civilian casualities, international community in shock.

A galvanized Iran bands with Syria, Palestinian rebels, and several others band together to form the Unified Liberation Offensive, and declare war on Israel, ground invasion begins with air strikes provided by Iranian-owned Russian-supplied aircrafts.  Iraq cuts ties with United States and throws support behind Iran against Isreal.  US and NATO forces clash with Iraqi Security forces.  Afghani  Security Forces turn on remaining US forces.  Both join the ULO.

United States declares war on the ULO (with Congressional approval) and offers Israel full support.  Turkey is used as a platform for US attacks on ULO forces.  Out of nowhere North Korea voices support for Iran defending its Nuclear interests and fighting off oppressors.  North Korea mobilizes along DMZ.  South Korea and North Korea clash along the DMZ, North Korea is more prepared and starts pushing South Korea back down the peninsula.  China begins supplying NK with weapons and even soldiers, Japan enraged by this begins doing the same for SK.  USA offers support for SK and Japan, uses the Phillipines as a hub.

Simultaneously Russia voices support for Iran and by extension ULO.  Supplies Iran with weapons, and mobilizes forces.  When Japan begins supporting South Korea, Russia begins supporting North Korea, providing ""modern"" aircrafts and training for Chinese and North Korean pilots.  

After years of uncertainty, financial juggling, and political mishaps, the entire EU bands together to form a council on foreign affairs.  Germany is given majority power and control due to their overwhelming support of other nations, and their majority power--militarily and financially.   Due to mobilization of Russian forces, and Russia supporting a civil war in Ukraine; Sweden, Finland, and Norway all voice opposition and turn to the EU, NATO, and UN to ensure their safety.  UK has already agreed to back USA, France and Germany follow.

North and Central African countries are pulled towards the ULO because of their heavily Isalamic ties.  South Africa supports Israel and untes with neighboring countries to fend of the incoming Islamic Extremists moving south.  Madagascar closes its ports.

**So we have two major sides here**;

ULO (Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, etc.), Russia, China, North Korea, and various North and Central African nations.

**Against**:

USA, Israel, Majority of EU (France, Germany, UK, Italy, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Finland primarily), South Korea, Japan, Phillipines, and Turkey.

Now here's where it gets *hairy*, Saudi Arabia is a bit of a wild card, because they are primarily Islamic, but they have tons of US military installations.  I think, in the face of the ULO--primarily Muslims--as a major threat, the US people would grow increasingly racist, causing tensions to rise with SA, combine that with North Africa, Egypt and the ULO pressuring them, I see them banding with the rest of the Middle East.  But it could go either way really.

On top of that, we have India and Pakistan.  India is definitely going to get support from the USA.  Pakistan on the other hand, after years of civilian deaths at the hands of the US, would probably throw their support towards the ULO, and send forces through Afghanistan, and inevitably invade India.  India bands with the US.

*To be continued...*

EDIT:  For the love of god, I get it, I mispelled Israel, it has been corrected.  Also, changed UAO to ULO and made it sound more Authoritarian-y.

"Uhm. You may have a bit of underlying misogyny there, and it might be helpful to examine that (ie, ""women tend to choose easy majors in school"").

In any case, as a woman, you can be whatever you want to be. I'm a computer science major, and before that, a chemistry major (I'm nearly at a double major). Many women are into psychology, and that's not really an ""easy"" field. Nursing isn't an ""easy"" field.

Everyone in college - okay, not everyone, but there are a lot of immature people in college - checks their phone all the time. I've seen guys and girls do it in class. It's really disrespectful and annoys me as well, but it's not limited to one gender.

You could say that women talk about meaningless things, but what do guys do? One could say that they bond by verbally abusing one another. And at the heart of it, sports are... well, maybe not meaningless, but they do serve a form of entertainment. (Not that there aren't many women into sports - I'm one of them - but it is generally associated with masculinity.) Consider contact sports, where people are paid to essentially rough each other up. Boxers have lower IQs coming out than they did going in. If I recall correctly, the NFL Player's Association recently won a big settlement over the issue with so many players suffering long-term effects from concussions and being beaten up so many times. I think reality TV is asinine - something associated with femininity - but in both cases it comes down to people being paid to entertain others (unless you're an American college student - then you're just being exploited for no money). They require different strengths.

Regardless: yes, you can certainly transition if you don't like feminine things. I just wanted to point out that, hopefully you don't like them on a personal level, and I hope it isn't the case that you reject femininity entirely as something inferior to masculinity and 'masculine' interests."

"Here's the thing though, public utilities are not allowed to maximize profit. We can only increase prices at a fixed rate for non-contract customers. I believe it is something in the realm of 5% increase in price per year. And that is only if a 5% rise in cost can be justified (i.e. increased gas prices). 

Also realize that the government does not consider ""administrative costs"" justifiable for an increase in cost (not to mention the cost of lawsuits which happen ridiculously often). That includes engineers who design upgrades and maintain critical systems, program managers who have to deal with ridiculous government mandates, and account executives who have to deal with customer relations. In reality, this means that there have been hiring freezes for about 15 of the last 20 years for PU's and that there are less people to get the job done every year. 

Why the hiring freezes? Government mandated programs have fixed ratios for what administrative costs have to be less than (10 or 15%). Here's the problem though, they make the PU use their own funds for the initiatives, then pay them back later IF they meet program goals (which tend to be ludicrous). So when you see this ""green california"" crap, its all out of pocket from the utilities which takes away from our ability to upgrade to next-gen systems.

TL;DR - Utilities have to balance public safety (absolute number 1) with maintenance, government mandated initiatives, customer service, reliability, and upgrades to infrastructure on a shoestring budget. "

The other option is having a stagnating economy with gridlocked roads and broken buses while the government ""saves up"" for major expenditures like transit (much reduced ability to save of course because less tax revenue is coming in and they are spending the savings on stop-gap solutions to bigger problems). It is the epitome of penny-wise and pound-foolish.

I am concerned that this may facilitate the unnecessary mutilation and psychological abuse of prepubescent children by their misguided ideologue parents. 

It is also a pointless waste of time as transgender people are relatively very few in number and they are currently protected sufficiently by the charter. It is a bit like passing a separate law to make drinking and driving illegal when specifically drinking Cristal champagne.

Here we go... I love this stuff, thanks for having this debate with me! 

> 1.) Our ancestors didn't have morality for 97000 years and managed to get along anyway?

Of course they had some sense of morality, considering that the gospel is written on our hearts; and there are laws of write and wrong that we inherently know. 

> 2.) God instilled morality in all humans since the beginning, and Jesus walking around teaching people in the desert was just for shits and giggles.

Wrong. The old testament showed how far humanity has fallen and what God expects from them; the New Testament gives them the ability to live it out. 

> No one. There are certain moral principals that results in demonstrable success for a society. Other ideas are iffy, they work sometimes...others not so much. And then there are lots of ideas that are just plain bad, and they result in a tremendous amount of unpleasentness.

How do you choose which are good and bad? You can't possibly live long enough to see everything played out. 

> The basis for what makes sense to embrace as good is based on the results, not it being an authority telling you it is.

Well, there have been times in human history when we thought Nazism and Fascism were great. Clearly following what society does is just a horrible measuring stick for morality. 

> I can say with tremendous confidence that slowly killing a baby for a week is never a good thing. 

Why? There are plenty of people that have zero issue with it. They are part of society, too, you know. 

> Christians and Jews alike have to insist that it is for us, but when god did it to David's baby...that was very morally good. 

David still had to pay the penalty for his sin. David also lusted, committed murder, and was prideful. It's not like he was perfect. 

I never said it was morally good. It *was* morally just for God to do it. 

Why? 

Nathan's parable (that is earlier in the story) illustrated David's sin for him by point out plainly the gravity of his sin and his culpability for the sin involved. 

David, to his credit, repented sincerely. Nevertheless, since justice must be accomplished, the Lord told David that violence would continue to plague his family, his wives would be taken from him, and his song born from Bathsheba would die. 

His sin is very comparable to Adam, since David represented the first in his line of descendent, and through his actions, he brought the consequences of his sin to his progeny.

> I can explain to you why it is bad to slowly kill babies, theists can only declare on faith that god killing a baby is a good thing.

Seriously? We know by natural law, as well as one of the ten commandments, as well as sacred tradition. 

How incredibly ironic that you attempt to stand in judgment upon the ethical behavior of God when, if one embraces your position, there is no such thing as an absolute, objective, authoritative standard by which to pronounce anything right or wrong. 

You have absolutely no platform on which to stand to make moral or ethical distinctions—except as the result of purely personal taste. The mere fact that you are conceding the existence of objective evil (since you know that us killing babies is evil) is an unwitting concession there is a God Who has established an absolute framework of moral judgments.

> But they don't exist in people's imaginations. This isn't me cherry picking what I think is right. There is some really basic principals that are successful because they protect everyone from destructive behaviour.

So... just because something has a good outcome, it is automatically good? 

Do you think that as long as something reduces suffering, it's not evil; or something could be evil, even if it reduces suffering in the long run?

For example: would you say that it is wrong to kill infants that have even mild handicaps or genetic deformities so that our species can survive? Or forcibly sterilize someone so that they don't have any more children than they can care for?

> No. This is short sighted and it lacks real consideration for the verifiable moral principals which are demonstrably valuable.

How? What are you basing that off of? 

> You see I consider that which everyone benefits from to be something that is moral. 

Very interesting. That sounds very utilitarian. 

> You probably focus on morality not being functional but instead good for reasons as declared by some authority. 

I focus on both. I believe in a deity that gives divinely inspired law that is for our benefit. I see the functionality of them in the every day world.

> See, I can only rely on that which actually has some sort of demonstrable value. 

That's only a piece of the puzzle, though. You could still justify doing something horrible ""for the greater good.""

"**WARNING: Long post and spoilers incoming.** 

To start with: Monogatari (Bakemonogatari in particular) is the anime that brought me into anime as a medium. So my words may be somewhat (completely) biased as Monogatari is my favourite series. 

I think Monogatari is all about saying usual things in unusual ways. Remember what Kaiki said to Araragi at the end of Koimonogatari (the last arc of the second season)? ""I did nothing special, just said some obvious things"". It is not about sending the message to us (though the messages are often on spot), but about the way *how* this message is presented to us. Another strong feature is its dialogues. Koyomi and Tsukihi talked for about ten minutes about love at the start of Nekomonogatari, but I was everything but bored. The dialogue was bizzare and had some unexpecting twists in it, but it was always on spot and never went too far from the main point - Koyomi's feelings towards Hanekawa. And this is only one example that came to my mind.

Now I can sing songs of prase to Shaft, but I'll try to make it short: Shaft did amazing, even outstanding job. Even if you end up not liking Monogatari, you know - that anime was something special, out of place, strange, odd. They made it memorable. I know, many were annoyed by all these flashy frames with (almost) meaningless text, but to me it made sense and added some charm, uniqueness. I think it is the best Shaft's visual work for today (SZS is really close, but it is a different story).

Breaking down the series:

**Bakemonogatari** was a complete blast for me. The relationship between Araragi and Senjougahara seemed odd and sincere at the same time. Yes, their relations are somewhat bizzare, but you can completely see *why* they are so strange. While I see Hitagi Crab as an introduction story, Mayoi Shail is where Araragi and Senjougahara interaction is in bloom (by the way, I think it is the best arc in the Bakemonogatari). To say the least - I was moved. Suruga Monkey and Tsubasa Cat are also great, superb stories that were focusing on some other great characters and their (jealosy and hiding the truth from yourself, known problems, huh?) troubles. Only Nadeko Shake was somewhat moderate, but Araragi and Hanekawa dialogue at the library made up for that. Oh, and the soundtrack was something special too. Listening to it once in a while. 

**Nisemonogatari**... well, to be honest, I was disappointed. It is not a bad anime by no means, but it is a step backward comparing to almost-flawless Bakemonogatari. The arcs were good, but not something special and pretty long (large part of the Karen Bee our fellow Koyomi was visiting his harem and just derping). New characters (Kaiki and especially Kagenui and Ononoki) were not quite interesting and deep at that particular moment (however Karen was shown really well). Fanservice... I don't mind it, but sometimes it was just too over the top. If Bakemonogatari was good at delivering fanservice, Nisemonogatari crossed the line when it was not enjoyable but disturbing experience. Do I think it could be better? Yes, I do. But what we get is also pretty nice.

**Nekomonogatari: Kuro** is a great prequel. I think it is harder to make a prequel than a sequel due to necessity in tying up the ends with the parent story, and Nekomonogatari was a perfect prequel in this sense. We've got some amazing (as always) dialogues, terrific story and reasoning why Araragi is so attached to Hanekawa (not to mention that she became really good character). There was a fanservice, yes, but the focus was on something else. By the way, OP was beautiful.

I was so afraid of a **second season of Monogatari**. My expectations were so high that I was almost sure that I will be disappointed one more time. Little did I know that I was totally wrong. To my mind, Second Season even surpassed Bakemonogatari. A Monogatari fan got all that he could imagine in his wettest dream: fleshing out old characters (Hanekawa became most developed charactrer in the series), bringing to life some other (DAE Kaiki best girl?), introducing mysterious new (Ougi and Gaen) and some incredible good stories. Nadeko, who was always looked at as a loli-part of Araragi's harem, became one of the best characters in the series. Same goes to Shinobu. I bet everyone was tearing up a little (or not a little) when Hachikuji left Araragi and when Senjougahara was trying her best to solve the problem with Nadeko. I think one of the strongest points of the Second Season was that the first time series was not only Araragi-driven, but we saw different points of view. It helped us to learn more about Hanekawa, Nadeko and Kaiki and internal motives of their actions.

I can talk about Monogatari for hours (shoutout to my friend who is also into anime and who always patiently listens to me). As I said, Monogatari is the first reason why I even love anime, why I'm even here. I completely understand that Monogatari is not for everyone and not everyone would end up enjoying it. But I think, at least, this anime is *special*. Hopefully not only for me.

P.S. Expecting Hanamonogatari and Kizumonogatari is so bittersweet experience.

"A lot of what you ask is difficult or impossible to answer because it's based on wrong assumptions, but I'll do my best here. Note that this kind of thing is better suited for places like r/DebateACommunist, but what the heck.

> I'm asking this question to get a better understanding of communism. I'm going to layout a few facts about myself, and hopefully they can be addressed. Some of these questions are elementary, but I ask them to clear up any confusion I may have.

The biggest confusion here, although in some sense it's just a technicality, has to do with the word ""communism"". Marxists consider communism the last stage of socialism, where to put it simply all the limitations and contradictions of capitalism are finally overcome. According to them pretty much by definition it is *impossible* to get to this point overnight, and this notion informs a lot of their tactics, strategies and ideas. So I'll work with the assumption that some sort of revolution has happened in the US, immediate steps towards socialism have been taken, and we are now living in a society on its way to communism.

> I went to a community college and got my associates degree in IT; I cannot afford to go to a university to get a BA/BS in CS or IT in the US. Would communism pretty much guarantee that I get to advance my education further?

All socialist societies have made a priority universal and compulsory education. So yes.

> I make $30k a year at a major hosting company. What would happen to this hosting company? Would they be 'evaporated'; would they still exist but with less ""power""? It took me 6 months (technically 15 months) to get this job. In communism if I'm out of work, what happens? Am I in a pool of citizens that need a job?

Not all companies would suffer the same fate immediately. All major ones would likely be nationalized, and they would be put to work towards some goal agreed by their workers (who would now have far more control over them) and higher up institutions in charge of overseeing the overall economic development. If your company is a major one I'd say something like that would likely happen.

> I cannot afford healthcare; how would communism address this?

Same as education, universal healthcare would be provided by society regardless of your situation.

> How would companies like Microsoft cope? 

Similar to your own company, it would likely stop existing exactly as it is and transition towards working to achieve actually necessary goals. For instance if a revolution actually happened in the US I'd expect Apple, Google, Microsof et al. to stop competing and duplicating their work and start cooperating to provide affordable and top-quality software and hardware for the US and the rest of the (socialist) world.

> Would open source software like Linux prosper?

Hard to say. I'd imagine free software would have a vital role to play in a modern socialist society though.

> Competing open source software such as Apache and nginx; at a communistic level, what would happen? This question is irrelevant most likely, but curious either way.

That would be up to the people doing the development. Not really that different from today.

> How are ""jobs"" handled? Would I be forced into a job I do not like? Do I have the power to ""choose""?

This depends a lot on the situation. A socialist state would need to balance the private desires of everyone with the need to provide for all society, not to mention the need to regain the ""investment"" made in education. If you spend 15 years studying to be a doctor and then decide you want to be a gardener society has lost a lot of money on you; if everybody does this we'd be in trouble. Also, shitty jobs that nobody wants would probably be subsidized to attract people towards them, and would ideally become a priority for mechanization and automation. In any case, in places like the USSR people were *not* tied for life to jobs they did not want, there was mobility in this regard.

The book ""Towards a new Socialism"" actually goes into quite a bit of detail on the topic of how to properly manage the balance between society's needs, the cost of education, people's desires, etc.

> How are work hours? Do you have ""workers rights""? What are my responsibilities as a worker?

Generally all socialist societies (except for critical situations like wars, famines, etc) had very developed worker's rights. Reasonable work hours, pensions, benefits for parents, insurance against injuries, paid holidays, etc. I remember reading a union representative from West Germany say that every time they bargained with their bosses the whole of East Germany would also sit at the table, since their situation served as an example to compare themselves to.

> Would communism favor public transportation over car transportation? Public transportation is more beneficial and efficient; ideally, what would a communistic society do in this situation?

Depends on the specific situation. I imagine for the US a vast effort to introduce better mass transit would be a very likely scenario.

> We have three major companies in the US: in a communist country how would this work? Would there be one system that is ""open"" for anyone to develop games on?

Games are not a social necessity, so hard to say. I'd expect much more flexibility in areas like this compared to other, more important, production.

> Do people have personal property (clothes, shoes, magazines, etc.)? How does this work? Do they own this property?

Yes. Only means of production are public. Nobody really cares about your shoes.

> I see communism as having a single class (middle-class). I see the middle-class making between $x dollars and $y dollars. For example; assume $30,000 to $250,000. Would a nuclear physicist or doctor make more money than a auto mechanic for example? I know that ultimately communism has no ""monetary"" system. But, then that leads me to asking how are the people that put more effort into their education rewarded?

As mentioned before, in socialism it is possible that some people would be paid more depending on factors like how much demand is there for their job, how necessary it is, even how good they are at it.

A *priority* of socialism would be to reduce this inequality progressively, until everyone just does whatever they can without expecting a higher reward.

As for the rest, you are just assuming a capitalist mindset where money and profit are the main driving forces of the economy and wondering how could anything possibly work if those are missing. A communist society would not work under a capitalist mindset, so you are pretty much begging the question. People can (and often do when they are allowed to do so) work, and work much better, when they love what they are doing, when they believe in what they are working towards, when they feel they are in control of their lives and they and their families and friends benefit from that work. The notion that the only way to motivate someone is to threaten her with starvation unless she works for a wage in a shitty job she dislikes is a weird notion indeed.

> How would people that made phenomenal contributions to humanity be rewarded? For example; under a communistic society, say a group of scientists invents a cure to cancer. How would they be rewarded?

Most scientists I know work long hours for a shitty pay just because they love doing research. This example is often used but I think scientists would be among the most benefited from living in a socialist society."

"Like his choices for nerfing Shaman.  And let's be clear here - they arent nerfs in traditional sense.  This is balance.  We arent just nerfing it and making it worse - we are making it actually fucking fair.  They have everything right now.  
  
They had 2 cards balanced (3 dmg removal that was 1 mana and could combo with windfury weapons/minions for 6 dmg for 1 mana vs 2 mana 3 dmg for everyone else) and a 3/2 for 3 that summoned game winning minions half the time.  A complete blow out half the time is not fair in any way and its not variance either.  You have to have board and removal to combat it and it just leaves tempo open to the shaman as you deal with a 3 drop like that.  Combined with must remove tunnel trogg and overstated 3/4 for 2 mana and overstated 7/7 for 4 mana and 0 mana 5/5 with taunt and so on, NEEDING to deal with a second totem golem or losing board to flametongue trades out of nowhere or mana tide winning the game with card advantage just kills you.   
  
THe fact only 2 of these cards were changed is ridiculous.  They did the bare minimum changes and stated they will let the other problems rotate out in 3 or 4 months.  Hex is polymorph for less mana.  Probably should be 4 mana.  Maybe too much with standard rotations, but unless they completely ignore shaman and give it crap from now on, it will be still be a very cheap hard removal in the future.  Maybe tone it down now like he says.  
  
Thing from below is a joke.  Should be more expensive and take longer to be free or work like the other cost reduction card from the old gods set and the druid card from wild and only see reductions if it is in your hand when a totem is played.  Allows it to be played at full cost as top deck or get reductions and played early if you draw early in the game.  you should regurgitate your hand onto the board after a wipe and play a free 5/5 with taunt to boot.  Would still be powerful card, but balanced for its cost this way with maybe some adjustments to full cost based on what way they go.  Shouldnt have to wait another year for this thing to go away when they can literally fix it now.  
  
Spirit Claws has to be the biggest joke in existence, too.  Who in their right mind thought this was a shaman card and who thought it was balanced as a 1/3 for 1 mana?  Even more it goes to 3/3 with spell power in a class that creates spell power totems and benefits greatly from thalnos and azure drakes.  This card alone eliminated zoo from the ladder since they cannot compete with this weapon in any way when they were a good counter to shaman.  Maelstrom portal was the other nail in the coffin for zoo.  Shaman has a 2/3 for 2 with 1 overload.  A bad weapon by all accounts, but at least relatively balanced compared to this nonsense.   Another year of autoinclude win axe on steroids is insane.   
  
A nerf would be just taking random cards and making them garbage with no reasoning behind it.  We use it for all things balance related these days, but these shaman cards are so overtuned, its not even reasonable for them to exist as is.  No one could argue it is balancing and not outright nerfs.  The class wouldnt be destroyed if you toned multiple more cards down.  Dont destroy them like Starving Buzzard or Warsong Commander - just balance them slightly to bring the power is line with other options from other classes.  "

"I have a big problem with this. Even if he does have damning evidence on Clinton, it looks like he's trying to maximize damage against her on her presidential campaign, rather than release the leaks for the common good. Building up to the election like this can have huge consequences for the US as a whole, regardless of what she did or did not do. Couple that with nothing on Trump, and it looks off. 


**The responsible thing would be to release it as far advanced to the elections as possible so the US people can actually discuss it rather than have a knee jerk reaction. **


Edit: I can't respond to everyone, but I've gotten a lot of similar comments. 


1. I emboldened the part where I'm clearly okay with leaking information. It's the timing that I don't like, and one sidedness that doesn't seem right. I understand that having something on Clinton does not guarantee there is something on the RNC/Trump, but it definitely seems one sided. 



2. ""He's doing not because people forget quickly! Clinton deserves this! The American people need to wake up!"" I don't think the ends justify the means in this, and that the US people aren't as dumb (or you aren't as smart) as you make them out to be. The irony here is that Trump is not escaping over time, and if Clinton did something truest horrible I'm pretty confident she'd be treated the same. 



3. ""The news media is obviously controlled by Clinton!"" Unless you think the evangelical church, Mormon church, Glenn Beck, RNC and many conservative news companies are also colluding with them, then Trump is probably as worthy of this attention as it gets. I'm very concerned with him promoting the idea that the election is rigged, as it will probably lead to his followers taking more drastic measures. He's a sore loser that does not consider the outcome of his actions. 


4. ""Everything about Trump is already public, so there's nothing to leak"" There's still the details of the many sexual harassment cases against his company, information on Trump U, his charity, private business dealings, more tax returns, details of his rape allegation from his x wife that was retracted as a part of their divorce settlement, etc. There's substantially more to expect from Trump than Clinton.


5. ""You're a cuck for Clinton!"" We get it, you go to 4chan. 


6. ""Clinton is a criminal!"" Please provide a reputable source for this. Everyone keeps saying ""it's everywhere!"" or ""CNN liberal bias!"" but no ones actually linked anything. I'm certainly open to the idea, but no one who's replied to me has provided *anything* so I'm inclined to not believe this. "
"1: If you need BB more than CA go with Yamashiro or Roma otherwise go with Chikuma or Choukai. Doesn't really matter which of the two you choose. Ryuuhou should be the last ship you use a blueprint for. If you don't already have Abukuma Kai Ni get her first.

2: First off get a 5th and level them all to 20 and remodel them.  Only then will you want to give them to either Kitakami, Ayanami, Yuudachi, Myoukou, Abukuma or even Bismarck Drei if you have her. Yukikaze also works if you want more consistency but there is supposed to be a soft cap as well so keep that in mind.

3: Minimum LSC, you can get your 5th maruyu while you attempt to build her. Just as an fyi, she's pretty average in terms of strength and not really worth much if you want a CL to use.

5: BB Guns (381mm kai, 38cm kai, 41cm specifically) to +10, AP shells to +6, 20.3cm No.3 +9, Quint torpedoes to +9 (don't bother upgrading other torpedoes) and 90mm +9 or 10. The type 21 Kai is stronger than a type 14 at +10, it may or may not be worth doing later on. Don't upgrade and more 12.7cms, it's kind of a waste. Also try to do them in that order.

So you think in the US if something like that happened no ex military would be involved? You have no idea what the culture here is like. Some of the biggest proponents of this are ex military.

But when you go through the trouble of getting a tattoo or piercing, the effective permanence and immutability of that (for the sake of self-expression?) means that you've prioritized that *something* above all other things.  I think that such a decision is justifiable, but also says a great deal about a tattoo wearer which he/she may not really wish to say.  But that really isn't for *me* to say, so probably a moot point.  You personally may not care what I or anyone else think.  But it makes me sad that you've thus closed off your mind from ideas and opinions which may well be worthwhile.  

(btw, I reserve judgement until I've actually seen what you look like.  I don't care if you are necessarily attractive or beautiful.  If you are 250lbs with tasteful images composed well on ample flesh I might just applaud you.)"

"Lets see, there are a fair few:

* GSync handles the lower refresh range significantly better than FreeSync does. It does this by doubling/tripling/etc. frames when the framerate goes below the minimum refresh rate of the panel. This has a twofold benefit. One, it insures that the panel won't be damaged due to a low refresh rate (which can happen if the refresh rate of the panel is too low). Two, it allows you to maintain being in the variable refresh range, no matter how piss poor your framerate at any point in time might be at. FreeSync only currently offers switching to VSync at the low end (which locks you into the low end refresh rate when that bottom threshold is passed, which introduces severe input lag (which is jarring), or no VSync (which means you get tearing).

* Tighter control of the ASIC/FPGA that goes into these panels has ensured that GSync monitors have maintained a larger variable refresh rate window. Most notably with IPS screens. Where you have the MG279Q having only a 35Hz-90Hz variable refresh window, but the upcoming PG279Q GSync panel having a 30Hz-165Hz refresh window. And that Acer (don't remember the exact model number) supporting a 30-144Hz variable refresh range . Many other panels share the same.

* Variable overdrive. This is the most understated feature. But the GSync FPGA has logic to adjust the overdrive moment to match the targeted refresh rate. So significantly better ghosting reduction during variable refresh operation.

* ULMB, which although this isn't GSync, is an inclusion in the models that can support the required refresh rate and pixel response times.


So go ahead, downvote me all you like. I'm just stating factual stuff about each technology. I don't doubt that FreeSync might overtake GSync in the future. But as of right now, the only thing FreeSync offers is the POSSIBILITY of being better than GSync.

Now whether those very real, physical benefits of GSync are worth the price increase, that is completely up to the person that is paying the money required to purchase the monitor. And right now, both FreeSync and GSync are effectively locking you into their own company's ecosystems."

Trackers and such are bad references (motion sickness), but AR is transparent so has actual references - a view of the world. I'm not going into this anymore - really everything has been said."
"I've had a fair amount of experience with this. I've been making films in Columbia, MO for the past few years. It's a college town, so it isn't super tiny, but it's not a metropolis. In my time here we've shot in diners, concert venues, screenprinting shops, movie theaters, school campuses, and (tonight, if all goes well) grocery stores. Here's the biggest thing I've learned, not just in regards to locations, but indie filmmaking in general:

Ask without expectation, and allow yourself to be surprised by the generosity of others.

Politeness is the name of the game. It seems obvious, but be as upfront as you can. You want them to say yes, but you also don't want to burn any bridges for people who may ask later. You have to be a positive force for your local film community, and if local businesses have a bad experience, it may shut them off for future filmmakers.

First of all, you should put together an information sheet in indesign or something similar. Provide a brief synopsis of your film, a description of your situation, a brief list of what you need, and the contact information for your producer, assistant director, and possibly yourself. At the bottom, have a few lines where they can fill out information that you can tear off and take with you. That way you can have paperwork to show them that you're actually making a film and not just trying to get free food or something. (Trust me, this goes a LONG way in making you look legit.)

Here's an example

When you go in to talk to a manager/owner, be polite. Did I mention that already? Oh, well here it is again: BE POLITE. Nobody likes an auteur complex, and acting like a big shot will only turn them off. Tell them your name, shake their hand and introduce yourself as a local filmmaker. Explain that you're shooting a film, and you have a scene set in [wherever], and you were hoping you could use their store. Speak with confidence.

Explain what you'll be using it for, what you'll be doing, and how long you will need. (Have you worked on many productions before? Because if you're new to filmmaking, understand that even simple setups take a LONG time. We requested 4 hours in a grocery store to get one shot, so give yourselves enough time without over-asking.)

In most of these locations, you will want to shoot overnight while they're closed, so you can better control your environment without interfering with business. This sounds like a lot to ask, but businesses are usually very responsive to this, IF you offer to pay the hourly wage of an employee to come in and oversee the production. Even if you're shooting a no-budget short, it's more than worth it to pay someone $12 an hour for 8 hours to come in, because not only could it make the difference between getting the location and not, but they'll also be able to shut off refrigerator compressors, turn off air conditioners, (really turn off anything that will ruin your audio) and tell you which outlets are on what breakers. They're great to have, and it will only cost you upwards of $150 for an entire night. 

Once you're done stating your case, leave them the information sheet with your contact information. And whether or not they say yes, be understanding, and thank them for their time. Remember: You went in without expectations, so you don't have anything to be disappointed about. But if they say yes, you've just made a valuable new partner. And assuming you get the location, treat it with the utmost respect. Be careful with equipment, and leave it exactly how you left it. Don't take advantage of their generosity.

On my last short, we were shooting a scene in a police station/police chief's office, and all of the local police departments (understandably) said no. In a last-ditch attempt, I started walking door-to-door asking businesses if they had an office we could use. Most didn't, but EVERY ONE was receptive, and tried to help me however they could. Finally I wandered into a screenprinting shop, and the owner was one of the most enthusiastic people I've worked with. We came in on a weekend when they were closed and shot for 12 hours over 2 days. He let us re-arrange anything and everything, all while he sat at work on a Saturday. When we left, we cleaned up everything, put things back and took out the trash. We left the location better than when we found it. A few months later I was shooting a short comedy sketch, and we needed an office. An hour before our shoot, our location fell through, so I called the owner of the screenprinting shop. Because of how we treated the location the last time, we got to come in again with an hour notice to shoot the sketch.

As independent filmmakers it's easy to paint business owners as nasty crumudgeons who don't want people invading their stores. But you need to remember that in a sense, you're a small business owner as well. Treat them with respect, but treat them like a peer. Kindness and respect will get you very far."
"Doctor in question here. Please reread the post, this time with your testosterone subreddit glasses off:
>No. You're wasting your money taking those tests more than once, if at all. 'Low Testosterone' is a fad diagnosis. There are several dozen other diagnoses I'd investigate for 'feeling tired' before I went to testosterone.

I'll rephrase: No, testosterone probably isn't the cause of his symptom of 'tiredness'. He's wasting his money to get testosterone levels more than once at this point, and that may be because American doctors in particular are exceptionally keen on diagnosing 'Low T' in people with no significant evidence of hypogonadism.

There are many other tests I'd do in someone who is 'tired' before I went with 'low testosterone' as a primary cause.

"I understand better now, but the same problem still remains. Coffee drinking culture is not that well developed here where I live. People do drink coffee and they drink a lot of it, but there is no... I'm not sure how to word it, but it's all basic.

For instance there is quite a few tea houses around here, where drinking tea is taken to a whole new level. It's an experience, you take your time and you enjoy. It's not like that with coffee. So locally, I got no place to learn from.

Sarajevo, city where I was born, has quite a few shops that roast and sell their own coffee. I can go there, try to gather information, tips and such - getting a job there is not an option. Would provide for very poor livelihood.

"i've seen you bring this argument to the table a few times. Why are you so opposed to it, even though there are studies upon studies upon cite-able studies that show, at the very least a logical correlation between the two?

Just because something hasn't been used as diagnostic criteria doesn't mean that studies aren't pointing that direction. 

Do you have a vested personal interest in Gender being a complete social construct? I get it, some people have developed an identity around being who they are, because they want to be that person, and in the sense of societal gender roles, that's totally true and valid.

But when it comes to gender identity, and why we are who we identify as, there ARE physiological reasons for it(there is a physiological reason for everything that a human does or thinks, we are just a big chemical reaction after all), and the brain IS physically dimorphic. It's logical to say that there is a connection between that dimorphism, and dysphoria, especially with things like phantom limb syndrome in trans people, and brains that match the gender they identify as in multiple studies.

Does the fact that males and females have different brains turn your world view upside down? it it a scary concept? I'm not trying to attack you, those are sympathetic questions. it's not something to fear. Men and Women DO think differently, and it;s a wonderful thing, it's also not exclusionary. Just because a woman may think in a different way from a man doesn't make her points any less valid, or stop her from coming to the same conclusions. Just because the neurons fire in a different pattern, doesn't mean that they can't come to the same decisions, or result in the same(or different) likes, and desires. 

Do you fear this result, as a trans person, because you fear a physical diagnosis exists that you might fail? Do you fear it, because you LIKE who you are and you fear that if a physiological cause would lead to 'corrective' treatments being possible? Even if you did fail a physical diagnosis, just would mean that they wouldn't have found EVERY reason that leads to someone being trans, it wouldn't invalidate your feelings, or your identity.

even if it became possible to physically 'correct' a transgender brain, it would still be wrong. a person's brain is who they are, to remove or restructure it, would be to change who that person fundamentally is, and even in today's world, that is considered wrong(see: no more lobotomies)

This isn't an explanation to fear, it's one to help us who are trans perhaps be identified earlier in life. Think how wonderful it would be if it COULD be a diagnostic criteria and you could have started transition at age 6, because they caught it, and could assuage your parents fears that it was 'just a phase'

if you fear it because you don't want to weaken your view on gender roles not meaning anything, rest assured, gender identity is often as much, if not more about physiology as it is about social norms. social norms are still generated by society, but gender identity is not shaped, or molded by the world around us. It is innate."

"I think it's a productivity problem.  As an example, back during the ""Echoes of the Past"" release, there was a POI where someone mentioned in passing that the ""Ghosts of Fort Salma"" story chapter had taken 120 hours of work.

For those who don't remember, this was the one where you show up at fort salma, walk across it while fighting off some seraph ghosts, and then talk to the ghost of Majory's sister.  So the instance required no new art assets and has only minimal scripting.

If that actually took 120 hours to put together, that suggests there's a serious problem with Anet's design tools, because that should have been the sort of thing a designer can point and click together in a couple of hours."

"> games prioritizing story over gameplay

There's nothing wrong with that if the gameplay on offer is still extremely solid. Didn't like the gameplay? Fine. But the multiplayer was praised by pretty much everyone who played it, so it definitely didn't prioritize story over gameplay to a fault. It provided a solid skill based experience. It's not dark souls or starcraft, but not everything has to be.

> overwrought grimdark story to attract praise

It was hardly grimdark. Good things happened in the game. The dark stuff was contrasted perfectly with beauty. Just because it was nuanced, and not happy-go-lucky, that doesn't make it ""grimdark to attract praise"".

> Take away the story and TLOU becomes a very competent but not spectacular or groundbreaking tps.

"On the question of whether the buildings were brought down with explosives, here's all you need to know about that: no freaking way. When you see one of those cool building implosion things that companies like Controlled Demolitions, Inc do, you're not seeing the real work there. Before they pushed the button and set off those explosives, a team of structural engineers with the original blueprints went through the building and completely gutted it, so that it was just BARELY standing on its own. And then they use really a surprisingly small amount of explosives to kick the slats out, and gravity finishes the job.

Now the REASON they use so little explosive is not because they're cheap--quite the opposite, all that gutting work costs WAYYY more than a ton of TNT. No, they use teensy amounts of explosive so they don't destroy the entire freaking city. There are typically buildings all around the building to be demolished that people would like NOT damaged. And explosives emit tremendous overpressure waves that turn everything in a serious radius to dust and jelly. And those waves spread out in a sphere around the explosion. So if they used explosive force to destroy the building, instead of gutting it and giving it a nudge, you'd break every window on a mile radius and turn people into chunky salsa. And that's generally considered A Bad Thing on a building site.

So, you wanna bring down the WTC with explosives? Groovy. You got precisely TWO choices:

1) Spend months gutting the buildings, busting through load-bearing structures, knocking out walls and ceilings. How you do that in TWO occupied buildings without anyone getting suspicious is an exercise left for the deranged. Then you wire up explosives in just the right places, arrange for four airline hijackings, secret government hit teams, all that other stuff as a diversion, then push the button, and hey presto! The buildings collapse just like you saw on TV...except, of course, the rubble would be missing MOST of the building's interior structure because it had been ripped out and hauled away (presumably smuggled out in backpacks and brief cases).

or,

2) Wire up enough explosive to blast out the crucial load-bearing members. How much is enough? Well, Mark Loizeaux, the head of Controlled Demolitions, Inc. and probably the world's foremost expert on the topic described it in terms of ""forklifts full of explosives being trucked in for days."" Without anyone noticing. And then you push the button and......KA BLAMMMM!!!!! The loudest explosion anyone has ever heard in the city happens, every window in a several-block radius turns to sand, and every human being in that radius turns to chunky salsa, due to the HUMONGOUS overpressure wave such a thing would generate. But I guess they had Men in Black teams to cover all that up.

Orrrrrr....and I'm just spitballing here, you could fly a fully-fueled large jet into the side of the building at well over 400 MPH. Due to the unusual construction of the WTC buildings, the plane would punch through the outer walls like they were made of paper mache, and release all its tremendous kinetic energy in the central core supports of the building, which are the main load-bearing structures. An enormous fire would ensue, not just jet fuel, but everything else than can burn in an office building, which is pretty much everything, and after the initial weakening from the impact and a time being in the core of an out-of-control fire, those load-bearing structures would start to lose their tensile strength, as steel does when it gets hot. And then there would come a point where they just couldn't hold up the weight of all that building above it, and....pancake city.

But that's ""just a theory.""

"At different eras in world history there have been sacred figures who, while apparently of flesh and blood, have been elevated to inhabit a special realm of near-divinity above the rest of fallible mankind.

In medieval China, they had the Ming Emperor, Lord of Ten Thousand Years, who employed the Mandate of Heaven to decide the fate of millions. His person was held to be inviolable and without imperfections. Those who dared to question his rule were flayed alive, their skin left hanging from a hook to emphasise the emperor would brook no challenge to his authority.

In contemporary Britain we have Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who employs control over interest rates to decide the fate of millions. His position is held to be independent and without any error. And so any criticism of his actions is regarded as a thought crime — and those who dare to question his rule are flayed in the press with dire warnings left hanging in the air to emphasise the governor will brook no challenge to his authority.

The latest politician to be rebuked by the governor is the prime minister who, in what was clearly an inappropriate step for the first lord of the Treasury, presumed to offer an opinion on economic matters.

The governor took exception to Mrs May devoting a section of her speech at the Conservative Party conference to monetary policy. Her crime was to point out that while “super-low interest rates and quantitative easing provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects. People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered. People with mortgages have found their debts cheaper. People with savings have found themselves poorer.”

For most of us listening this was about as controversial as asserting that water would certainly wet us and fire would certainly burn. Quantitative easing — and indeed the latest misjudged interest rate cut — have created significant economic problems. The prime minister was simply acknowledging the obvious and pledging, rightly, to address policies that generate inequality.

But for the governor, this was an act of lèse-majesté and dangerous heresy. The prime minister was no more entitled to talk about the economy than I would be to undertake brain surgery. As he explained, “the policies are done by technocrats. We are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side”.

Technocrats. Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it. The very phrase, with its connotations of sleek efficiency and Silicon Valley, is meant to suggest that we’re talking about some kind of upgraded version of our species — a sort of Human Being 2.0. Just as Homo sapiens has lost the thick body hair that marks out other primates, it’s implied that technocrats have shed the biases and prejudices that mark out lesser humanoids.

Except that if one actually takes the trouble to look at something as inconvenient as the economic evidence staring us in the face, it seems that technocrats have been about as much an improvement on boring old politicians as tower blocks were on Georgian terraces.

It’s the technocrats — those who scorned public opinion and asked us to trust the special expertise that only a background in international banking or academic economics can achieve — who have brought us the disaster of the euro, the immiseration of the Greek people, record youth unemployment in Spain and Portugal, unsustainable property booms and then crashes in Spain and Ireland, the weakening of Germany and Italy’s banking structures and a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. Oh yes, and a total failure to either predict, provide for or prevent the financial crisis of 2008.

Technocrats were about as likely to get things right as a dart-throwing chimp was to hit the bullseye
The trouble with technocrats is because they believe they’re smart, expert indeed, they don’t do what all humans should — and all politicians must — acknowledge when they’ve made mistakes, learn from errors and adjust their assumptions in the light of events. Because to do so would be to challenge their conception of themselves as bearers of superior insights who are not as susceptible to error as the rest of us.

Genuinely insightful and original thinkers, such as the development economist William Easterly and the political scientist Philip Tetlock, have convincingly demonstrated that those who consider, or declare, themselves experts are actually more likely to err than the rest of us.

Easterly’s work shows that western technocrats who have imposed their own “expert” model of economic development on those they consider the benighted citizens of poorer nations have actually held back growth and frustrated progress.

Tetlock’s study of the predictions made over 20 years by 284 experts, including academics and public officials, concluded that they were about as likely to get things right as a dart-throwing chimp was to hit the bullseye. Indeed, the more famous and lauded the expert, the more likely they were to refuse to acknowledge errors, and therefore the more likely they were to carry on getting things wrong.

Mark Carney may be many things but — like the rest of us — he is neither always infallible nor truly independent. Just like the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, his attitudes and prejudices reflect a career in Goldman Sachs and the biases current among central bankers. Mr Carney should ponder the fate of the Chinese emperors, overwhelmed by forces they could not control because they could not bear to accept any criticism, and recognise that nothing so enhances authority as a dash — now and then — of humility."

So personally, I'd replace this advice with - DON'T hesitate to make decisions that have a high chance of leading to your death, but if you do die make sure you LEARN from it.

Personally, upon accepting that death is a risk I could accept, my mechanical skill and decision making improved a lot, and I actually ended up dying less as I learned how to get into dangerous situations and make it out with an advantage.

Why would you want to live like that?

---------------------------------------

See, I can use ridiculous rhetoric as well. So, instead of trying to make baseless assumptions and ridiculous mangling of world views, how about we talk about what you asked instead.

You state the exact answer later, that is the reason many of us do not believe in such a useless thing as a soul. 

>Therefore, any belief about a soul is personal choice that is not based on evidence

Why would anyone decide to believe something without any shred of evidence? Because others told them it is so. Then, when you have lived your life being told this ephemeral thing is part of you, you take it for granted that it exists. 

The best I can make for the evidence of a soul, is the misappropriation of self awareness or consciousness as an independent feature of the bag of organs that is called a human. It is an amazing thing we have, but we are also amazingly error prone. And we assume that our self is independent of our flesh. I mean, my finger does not think, right? But that is because severe brain trauma is not an everyday experience of people. Lobotomies, brain injuries, brain cancer, etc. All of these things change a person such that they might even be unrecognizable except for the bag of bones they walk around in. So if any soul exists, it has no useful purpose then. It does not determine who you are. It can't be detected or effected. Why bother?

So, believing in a soul without any evidence for such is then the same as believing in any gods, space aliens among us, magical unicorns, faeries, mystical trolls, dragons (my favorite fantasy creatures btw), and other such stuff with not a shred of proof. 

If it makes you happy, it is within your right to hold that belief. But I see no need to waste my time. "

 Regardless, I never said that no one should have guns. It's perfectly fine to have guns for hunting, pest control, for farmers, etc. It's just that the buyer of the firearm should have a legitimate reason to buy one and that there should be background checks associated with the purchase of the firearm.

1) Underexperienced system administrators in the 90s vs Underexperienced system administrators in the 201x's:

In the 90s, we went on IRC, newsgroups, and RTFMd. IRC was more often than not a rather hostile environment. Thank fuck that shit is over with. Maybe it's because we can't see each other's IP addresses and username, or maybe it's because we're a little more mature, either way, if you went into #Linux and asked any sort of question, you had two possible scenarios:
  a) At least 10 people probe your computer looking for misconfigurations, log in and fuck with you
  b) At least 10 people pipe up to say ""RTFM LAMER""

So we went to various websites and again, newsgroups to get information which was crude and very technical, so in the end we had to do a lot of low-level experimentation in order to understand why something needed to be configured a certain way. 

I never touched windows until I had a ""real"" job, and as a colleague once said, ""You just click random shit until it starts working."" - but that's the Google Age, which brings me to now:

Information is practically free. Everyone blogs about how to configure X Y and Z, and everyone else reposts those blog posts on their own blogs. IRC is even friendly. And of course, everyone's favorite massive message board, Reddit has enough people dedicated to networking and sysadmin, and everything else that it's just *too damn easy* to hop online and start asking questions to *live* people rather than find blogs, or find documentation, or find existing examples. 

If you're a new sysadmin developing in the 2010s then I think you're predisposed to take advantage of what the internet has to offer, and realistically, this is what it offers - convenient, live people. 

I think a majority of the people who post the seemingly high-level questions just don't understand the difference.

Fucking computers. Hand-held diagnostic tools with wireless printing, graphing, data logging, real shit to do real diagnosis with. 

I have a feeling that in the ""olden"" days, people went straight for the kill for both fun, because they're cocksuckers, and because they want to teach you a lesson, the hard way. 

But the hard way may no longer be the best way. We simply manage high-level abstraction layers that interface with low-level services. When was the last time anyone here compiled their own web server from source, manually configuring every option from the web stack, down to the kernel? 

I think if you build a DNS server from scratch for the first time, you're forced to figure all of this out - but with windows? just right click and add domains! Active directory does the rest! Oh, Reverse lookup domains? What do those do?

1) Why can't he go through his own pants on his own time? I have literally never ""gone through"" my SO's clothes; he's a grown man and he can decide for himself what he wants to keep and get rid of. We each have our own dresser and our own side of the closet, so if he wants to hang on to old, worn out stuff, it doesn't matter to me (unless it were to start creeping into my dresser and my side and making it so I don't have enough room for my own things, but he's never let it get that bad.)

However, there is also 2) which is that while I think this particular story is a little weird (she needs to help him go through his clothing, and since he apparently needs help with that, he should take off his coat so she can actually see the clothing, but if she says that they will fight and he will withhold affection) I can also appreciate the main gist of the story, which is trying to let go of stuff that doesn't matter.

Something like that (if I found myself in the ridiculous position of needing to ""judge"" the state of my SO's pants) and he was wearing a coat making it hard for me to do so would probably push me past my limit, but I can definitely appreciate the feeling of talking yourself out of saying something in general because ""why am I getting so annoyed by this? It doesn't matter. It's not even wrong, it's just not how I would do it."" The struggle is real, ya'll. So, maybe I'm a bit more sympathetic to this poster, just because I can see a little of myself in her. "

"First of all, and I'm not 100% sure on this, but it seems like you're misusing ""OP"".

So before you continue, I want to make sure: You're saying that you post a comment on a video. Someone replies with spam. You go to remove their reply to your comment, but it only has ""Report spam or abuse"". You're mad because there's no ""Remove"" button anymore. Is that correct?

If it is, I think that this is a good thing. People completely misused this feature. Although it was originally intended to remove the spammers and trollers, it got to the point where people would start an argument and delete everything the other person had to say. Also, spammers would use this to their advantage. They would post something like ""check out my channel!"" and have their friends or second accounts reply with ""Nice channel, subbed!"" or something along those lines. They would then use a feature that allowed you to stop your comment from receiving more replies. Anyone who commented anything against the spammer had their reply deleted by the spammer. The thing is, they removed both the remove button AND the ""Stop further replies"" button (or whatever that button was called). Either that or they just moved them elsewhere.

The point of the matter is: By removing these buttons, it's actually helping to stop further spam. Of course, there's going to be different views to the matter. But for right now, this is probably the best thing they could have done. Hopefully that helped you with what you're worrying about."
">Virtually anywhere that you can rent an airplane they will make you take a checkout flight with them and an instructor. It doesn't matter if you have 50 hours or 5000 hours. The reason for this is because of insurance purposes.

"There is actually a good reason if you think about it longer.  One major worry people have about immigration is that people are taking their jobs.  However, there is not same panic about foreign investment and loans.  We have thus created a system where capital (usually rich people's money) can travel around freely, but people can't.  So companies can move freely and pick which workers they want.  Usually they will chose the lowest paid and most lightly regulated.  The people do not have a choice to move to higher paid, better regulated.  Thus, by making loans and investment free to travel, but not labor you get situations where American companies chose between building a factory in Mexico or America, but the people are stuck working in the country they are born.  Most companies will pick Mexico where labor is stuck in a low paying, low regulation environment.  What is the practical difference of Mexican workers moving to the US and working in a factory for American consumers, or Mexican workers working in a Mexican factory for American consumers?  What ends up happening is US workers lose their jobs and Mexican workers stuck in a low pay, low regulation environment and the gains of open trade goes to capital which is free to chose best returns.  If you open labor markets (allow immigration), workers would be free to move away from low paying, low regulatory jobs creating more completion for labor.  Allowing labor to capture more of the gains from a globalized trading system.  

So it turns out, markets for labor and capital are connected.  Equating these issues is far from idiotic or stupid as some people suggest.  "

"Generally, I agree with you on these terms. I'm actually a gun owner as well. I enjoy shooting and own a handgun. Living in a major metropolitan area, I have family and friends who are gun owners, the closest being my father who raised me with a deep respect and understanding of gun safety.

I think that conservative politicians and the NRA paint socially liberal city dwellers like me as gun-phobic ignoramuses because it's politically expedient. I'm *for* private gun ownership, but against quite a lot of the political rhetoric that the NRA pushes. I do think that politicians who don't understand guns have a skewed understanding of them and are bad at legislating them. But I also think that they need to be legislated. Buying my first handgun in PA was too easy-- took less than 30 mins and consisted of a quick phone call to determine that I'm not a felon. I wouldn't mind jumping through a few more hoops if it meant that other potential gun buyers had to do the same thing. How about mandatory safety training? You can buy a gun and get a concealed carry permit here without demonstrating any sort of firearm proficiency. That's obviously crazy, as we require a test of both knowledge and proficiency in order to drive a car. 

But when I express these views to conservatives, I'm branded a traitor, as if there's no acceptable middle ground between complete deregulation and an all-out ban on private gun ownership. 

It's a nuanced issue that isn't given due respect or consideration by those who claim to support the right to own.

And I'd like, for once, to hear a Trump supporter call him on his blatant disrespect for the FIRST amendment.

They only seem to care about guns."""

Print Page

Most of Martin Scorsese's films have been about men trying to realize their inner image of themselves. That's as true of Travis Bickle as of Jake LaMotta, Rupert Pupkin, Howard Hughes, the Dalai Lama, Bob Dylan or, for that matter, Jesus Christ. ""The Departed"" is about two men trying to live public lives that are the radical opposites of their inner realities. Their attempts threaten to destroy them, either by implosion or fatal betrayal. The telling of their stories involves a moral labyrinth, in which good and evil wear each other's masks.

The story is inspired by ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002) by Alan Mak and Andrew Lau, the most successful Hong Kong film of recent years. Indeed, having just re-read my 2004 review of that film, I find I could change the names, cut and paste it, and be discussing this film. But that would only involve the surface, the plot and a few philosophical quasi-profundities. What makes this a Scorsese film, and not merely a retread, is the director's use of actors, locations and energy, and its buried theme. I am fond of saying that a movie is not about what it's about; it's about how it's about it. That's always true of a Scorsese film.
This one, a cops-and-gangster picture set in Boston rather than, say, New York or Vegas, begins with a soda fountain scene that would be at home in ""GoodFellas."" What is deliberately missing, however, is the initial joy of that film. Instead of a kid who dreamed of growing up to be a mobster, we have two kids who grow up as imposters: One becomes a cop who goes undercover as a gangster, and the other becomes a gangster who goes undercover as a cop.

Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan, the kid spotted in that soda fountain by mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He enlists in the state police after Costello handpicks him so many years before as a promising spy. Leonardo DiCaprio is Billy Costigan, an ace police cadet who is sent undercover by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) to infiltrate Costello's gang. Both men succeed with their fraudulent identities; Colin rises in the force, and Billy rises in the mob.

The story's tension, which is considerable, depends on human nature. After several years, both men come to identify with, and desire the approval of, the men they are deceiving. This may be a variant of the Stockholm syndrome; for that matter, we see it all the time in politicians who consider themselves public servants even though they are thieves. If you are going to be a convincing gangster, you have to be prepared to commit crimes. If a convincing cop, you have to be prepared to bust bad guys, even some you know. Protect your real employers and you look fishy. ""The Departed"" turns the screw one more time because each man is known to only one or a few of the men on the side he's working for. If Billy's employer, Capt. Queenan, gets killed, who can testify that Billy is really a cop?

Ingenious additional layers of this double-blind are added by the modern devices of cell phones and computers. When the paths of the two undercover men cross, as they must, will they eventually end up on either end of the same phone call? When the cops suspect they have an informer in their midst, what if they assign the informer to find himself? The traps and betrayals of the undercover life are dramatized in one of my favorite moments, when one of the characters is told, ""I gave you the wrong address. But you went to the right one.""

Although many of the plot devices are similar in Scorsese's film and the Hong Kong ""original,"" this is Scorsese's film all the way because of his understanding of the central subject of so much of his work: guilt. It is reasonable to assume that Boston working-class men named Costigan, Sullivan, Costello, Dignam and Queenan were brought up as Irish-American Catholics, and that if they have moved outside the church's laws, they have nevertheless not freed themselves of a sense of guilt.

The much-married Scorsese once told me that he thought he would go to hell for violating the church's rules on marriage and divorce, and I believed him. Now think of the guilt when you are simultaneously (1) committing crimes and (2) deceiving the men who depend on you. Both Billy and Colin are doing that, although perhaps only a theologian could name their specific sin. A theologian, or Shakespeare, whose advice from Polonius they do not heed: ""To thine own self be true, and it must follow, as the night the day, thou canst not then be false to any man.""

Another amateur theologian, Hemingway, said it's good if you feel good afterward, and bad if you feel bad afterward. Colin and Billy feel bad all of the time, and so their lives involve a performance that is a lie. And that is the key to the performances of DiCaprio and Damon: It is in the nature of the movies that we believe most characters are acting or speaking for themselves. But in virtually every moment in this movie, except for a few key scenes, they are not. Both actors convey this agonizing inner conflict so that we can sense and feel it, but not see it; they're not waving flags to call attention to their deceptions. In that sense, the most honest and sincere characters in the movie are Queenan (Sheen), Costello (Nicholson), and Costello's right-hand man, French (Ray Winstone, that superb British actor who invests every line with the authority of God dictating to Moses).

It's strange that Jack Nicholson and Scorsese have never worked together, since they seem like a natural fit; he makes Frank Costello not a godfather, not a rat, not a blowhard, but a smart man who finally encounters a situation no one could fight free of, because he simply lacks all the necessary information. He has a moment and a line in this movie that stands beside Joe Pesci's work at a similar moment in ""Goodfellas.""

There is another character who is caught in a moral vise, and may sense it although she cannot for a long time know it. That is Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a psychologist who works for the police, and who coincidentally comes to know both Colin and Billy. Her loyalty is not to her employer but to her client -- and oh, what a tangled web that becomes.

It is intriguing to wonder what Scorsese saw in the Hong Kong movie that inspired him to make the second remake of his career (after ""Cape Fear""). I think he instantly recognized that this story, at a buried level, brought two sides of his art and psyche into equal focus. We know that he, too, was fascinated by gangsters. In making so many films about them, about what he saw and knew growing up in Little Italy, about his insights into their natures, he became, in a way, an informant.

I have often thought that many of Scorsese's critics and admirers do not realize how deeply the Catholic Church of pre-Vatican II could burrow into the subconscious, or in how many ways Scorsese is a Catholic director. This movie is like an examination of conscience, when you stay up all night trying to figure out a way to tell the priest: I know I done wrong, but, oh, Father, what else was I gonna do?

"One of the best ways I've found to get my menstrual cup out is to break the seal by pinching the bottom and pulling it out kind of at an angle. You'll be able to hear the suction release.

Do you have an especially short vaginal canal? It really shouldn't be poking you. Can you really not push it up any more? My fingers are definitely partially in me when I'm putting it in, so there is nothing poking out.

I have found that some times if other things are full (bladder, bowels), I don't have as easy of a time pushing things up there. Could that be a potential issue? Have you tried pushing your muscles like you're going to the bathroom and pushing up? I've found that sometimes helps.

How are you folding it to put it in in the first place?"

"> Its not like the SCOTUS performed some sort of coup d'etat in Marbury v Madison, judicial review is a logical conclusion to reading the constitution. Article 3 section 2 gives the courts to apply the law and Article 6 states the constitution is the supreme law of the land.

They did, they essentially gave the Federal Government the power to determine its own boundaries, that is a huge power grab that has caused a whole host of issues since.

> Irregardless, unless you are an absolutist and believe that any regulation on firearms amounts to an infringement on freedom then the discussion is about at what point does the state have an adequate interest in regulations that allows them to restrict that right.

I mean, the 1st Amendment says Congress shall pass no law...abridging the freedom of speech, yet you say they can?

> You may disagree with it, but that is how constitutional law works.

It's bullshit.  How can a document which contains protections against government overreach be interpreted by the same government which commits the overreach?

The powers of judicial review were never expressly provided to SCOTUS.

In fact, many of the issues which plague this nation today, including this particular topic, are due to this issue alone.  Everything from how the Government taxes and spends money, to how our freedoms are protected.  All decided upon an oligarchy of nine people in black robes.

Maybe it's the Founders' fault for failing to elaborate on how the Constitutionality of law was to be determined, or if that power has checks and balances to it."

"Yeap, you can remove those things with Titanium Backup. I can't really say there's a general guideline for what to remove since every carrier can load different things onto it. Common knowledge is that you don't want to remove the ""gallery"" app (even though QuickPic is orders of magnitudes better...and free) because it will cause some kind of instability; probably most things that are branded with your carrier name will be safe to remove, but always backup and freeze an app first to check for stability/functionality before uninstalling. In my case, my phone got a bit wonky if I uninstalled ""Samsung Apps"" (which I've never used) and my insistance to freeze and backup first saved my ass from deleting the system settings app (in my phone it read ""WALLPAP......."" in collapsed form).

"On the whole you've brought up some really good points - Raishan has done a great deal to aid VM unbeknownst to them. Still, they are right to suspect her due to her chromatic nature. In addition, if she's willing to completely betray Thordak for her own reasons, VM probably thinks she's just as likely to double-cross them once he's out of the way.

Raishan has picked a very good time to come forth. She has VM by the short hairs: while she knows a great deal about Thordak and his plans (likely), she also knows an equally great deal about VM. She knows where Whitestone is, she knows they are on a timeline, and she knows that timeline is about to run out. Also, the timeline is exacerbated by Percy's resurrection penalties which are likely going to take up the rest of it for him to fully recover.

On top of that, she's an ancient green dragon with considerable magic skills, and VM is in no condition to fight. The deck is stacked considerably in her favor, whether VM likes it or not.

Also, one last thing. More of a nitpick. You said:

>The first thing we learn here is that Primeval Awareness has no effect on Raishan, so she got herself very well protected for such magic.

When a creature shifts into a different form by an effect like Polymorph or Wild Shape, their creature type also changes to the corresponding form. The reason Primeval Awareness didn't work on Raishan (as Assum) is because she's considered a humanoid while in that form."

">I'm afraid they are currently antagonizing us, and probably won't back down until they get what they want.

I am of the opposite opinion though. We antagonized them first by setting up the Scarborough standoff, that's Philippine Navy ships, specifically the *BRP Greogrio Del Pilar* to arrest fishing vessels, not military vessels. I know we have the right to defend our EEZ BUT in this case, a diplomatic approach would have been far better than sending the goddamn navy after them. Or at least, just send the coast guard. Sending the navy is kind of an act of war, note that what defended the fishing vessels were not ships of the PLA Navy.

>I don't think our taking them to court was dependent at all on the mutual defense treaty. 

Well I agree that it isn't dependent at all on the mutual defense treaty. But the question is still would we have gone through that trouble of taking them to court instead of going through diplomatic channels? Note that we **never actually tried to talk with China** on any sort of high-level diplomatic way (sending Trillanes over does not count) over the whole South China Sea issue since .

>Right, but where will we get all that equipment? Currently, it's the US which supplies much of our military hardware. China certainly wouldn't provide us with such things since that would go against their interests.

The U.S. can still supply our military hardware. Or Russia. It's putting the cart before the horse. We need to massively ramp up military spending, if we have the money we can figure out where to get equipment. 

>Well, I mean, China supports the likes of Kim-Jong Un, so they aren't much better on that front. Certainly both aren't lily-white, but I'd rather support a country that is willing to follow the rule of law in international disputes.

Are you talking about the U.S.? The country which does not recognize the International Criminal Court, never ratified the UNCLOS (on which this case is all based) and [ignored an international court's ruling against it, vetoing every single U.N. resolution that asked for its compliance.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States) And I'm not even shitting against the U.S. here. The strong do as they will, blah blah blah, that's never more true in international affairs, and we just have to live with it and hopefully improve our own defensive capabilities in order to stop getting swatted around by giants such as China and the U.S.

>
Alright. Fair enough. Still doesn't mean that we should condone the injustices happening in our country.

We shouldn't.

Right. The US did terrible things to our country decades ago. But they've also given us significant amounts of aid since. China, meanwhile, continuously harasses our fishermen, uses our country as a dumping ground for their narcotics, and is currently destroying our natural resources by building islands on top of coral reefs. And this is happening right now. Today. Surely these actions should raise some serious red flags (no pun intended)?

The aid isn't reparation, and besides, how do you define significant? U.S. government aid is a drop in the bucket of our current economy. China is not treating us well too, but let me tell you the difference. 

We're friends with the U.S. and they treated us like shit ever since they annexed all our islands despite us having a functioning democratic government. They treated us like shit and murdered hundreds of thousands of us, and treated us even shittier by making us forget about that. They treated us like shit when they refused to extend the right to a jury to the Philippine islands despite this land being under the U.S. constitution, because the ""people were not ready."" The Japanese treated us worse so we welcomed the Americans back, but then they go around and treat us like shit and force the Bell Trade Act up our asses. Communist revolution brewing? They fucking support a kleptocrat dictator and welcome him to the White House, ensure shenanigans like the Jabidah massacre get covered up. And how about the fact that some rogue agent of the Feds gets caught just a decade ago, in Davao, with explosives, probably trying to set up a false flag operation. They're still meddling with our domestic affairs, and that country is ostensibly our greatest ally ever.

China? China does what you said. China claims Scarborough, actually all the South China Sea. They let a few citizens get rich from drug money. Okay. But China isn't our friend, because we avoid talking to China about these things since 1995. Finally an administration comes around that just like Ramos is willing to talk to China.

For one, structurally we see narrative similarities between the stories and the author's historical situation. A couple of examples, the stories of Adam and Cain is the story of Israel: exile as punishment for sin.

"As long as people are downvoting me, let's talk about that. With the unions, people have money taken directly out of their paychecks whether they like it or not. That money gets funneled directly into political coffers that use it to fund Democrats, almost exclusively. In the case of public unions, that money is spent to campaign for the Democrats that will then make sure that the unions get everything they want at the bargaining table. More than 87% of cases where these issues were sent to arbitration, the public didn't have the finances to fight them and thus they lost their cases to the unions. We have a situation where the unions can effectively hire their own bosses. In this case, the bosses are using taxpayer money to fuel their agenda and we have zero recourse as citizens. Don't like the Koch Brother's? Fine, don't buy their stuff. Don't like paying taxes into a corrupt system? Fine, how does jail sound? That is the difference. 

Now, you can say the Koch Brothers have too much influence, yet in the case of Wisconsin, many of the programs we use to invest in for the pension program use companies that the Koch Brothers own, like Georgia  Pacific. So it must be OK, as long as they don't have any influence in the actual political arena, right? BTW, our pension plan is one of the best in the country and is solvent. Yet, the Democrats hate the fact that people like the Koch's make this possible. 

Come on, without even going into how unions protect shitty workers and how they have screwed up any chance of reforming the failing schools, an honest person can see this is corrupt.

"But perceived personality is also a sensory stimulus, isn't it? Take for example a job interview. When an interviewee entered the room, you have already evaluated their appearance, you cannot help doing it, that's just how your brain works by following simple Pavlovian conditioning. Then you start taking with the interviewee and evaluate their communicative skills, which are arguably one level higher than appearance, but still are not personality. Only after long and close interaction you can evaluate a person's motivations, morality and so on. Still, even this would be perceived through the prism of many cognitive biases humans have. In different situations you can assign (or, more likely, try to assign) different values to different facets of a person, but you cannot eliminate completely some of them. Moreover, human brain is always trying to guess missing information from the data presented and a previous experience. Basically, it's impossible to pay less attention to the appearance when it's the only data presented."

But that's not saying we cannot adapt and MINIMIZE this inconvenience as Singapore proved (focus on high-yield mainland tourists who also happens to be those who don't go around shitting in streets).

You also don't see Singaporeans complaining because they're not whining bitches and they actually deal with their problems by adapting to them instead of attacking tourists. You know, like how we USED to do.

I realized this campus is huge, classes are 300+ people, and I was just convinced it wasn't for me. But when I started talking to some of my friends at other universities and started to visit them once the first semester got underway I realized IU is great. The resources available to students are incredible. Our campus is by far one of the pretties ones I've ever visited. And the culture of not only IU but Bloomington as a whole is unmatched. Some people prefer smaller schools. I thought that person was me, but I stuck it out and gave IU a chance and I don't regret it for a minute.

Even if the ML goes into the sub-bass, I think it's the filter that cuts out harmonics somewhere in the 60-80 Hz range (just a guess) that prevents a rich, full, rounded bottom.

Edit: to be more clear - a line extending horizontally across the photo tangent to both the top and bottom peak. 

Edit: oh wait i get it. The line on the 'down' and 'up' portion of the sine wave is thick and bold because there are a lot of tangents close (but not equal) thus filling in a broader range of pixels around that region. The derivatives around the peaks are more dramatically different so they dont visually 'add' up. As mentioned, this effect is due to sampling interval. As the interval approaches 0 the picture approaches black af, I believe. In other words the span of d/dx sin(x) is R^2 ? ? - whoa no, wouldn't that mean two tangents would have to be orthogonal and the function would then not be smooth?

"Per capita? You should look at overall figures because you are interested in knowing how much the country as a whole pollutes. India has a significant number of poor people who thankfully don't pollute as much as the rich which is why per capita numbers for India is so low.

India dumped more than 2 million metric tonnes of Carbon Dioxide in 2010 making it one of the worst polluters in the world even though we have one of the lowest emissions per capita in the world.

"I'm a law student who is currently taking an Administration of Criminal Justice course (basically constitutional criminal law). We're talking about 4th Amendment issues right now. I'll email this to my professor and see what he has to say. 

Edit: I've emailed my professor and included a link to the picture. I'll spot an update if and when I hear back from him.

ReEdit: I talked to my professor and he asked me to bring it up in class. The key issue is whether the card is left in the car or like under a wiper blade which I don't think we know . I'll update when appropriate. 


ANSWER FROM A LAW PROFESSOR: I just brought this up in class and we discussed it. This assumes that the card was left *inside* the car. (If the card was left under a wiper blade then it's ok.) The following is a paraphrasing of my Professor's conclusion given the facts we have.

Yes, there is a physical intrusion so it would seem to be a search and, therefore, against the 4th Amendment. However, since the car is unlocked there is no expectation of privacy. No expectation of privacy means no invasion of privacy. This would also fall under the police's duty to protect and serve. The police are not searching and seizing, they are protecting citizens. This is similar to a beat cop in an urban setting checking to see if shop doors are locked.

If the officer were to see, for example, an automatic weapon, which is clearly illegal, the search would be improper because the officer did not have lawful entry. This assumes that the automatic weapon was only visible by opening the vehicle. 

Moral of the story: Lock your damn doors.

EXTRA EDIT: Cars and homes are different. Homes are specifically listed in the 4th whereas cars are not. The home is sacrosanct. Cars have windows and can be easily seen into. Cars can be transported. Passengers are allowed in cars. Etc. They're different. 

Final edit: This is merely the paraphrase of one professor's analysis of the facts. This is only intended to be an analysis of the constitutionality of the facts under the 4th Amendment. This is not legal advice. A judge may decide this a different way and there are other possible arguments. Also, thanks to everyone who supplied info to me. I like to learn new things.

His job, as the chief executive for all Americans, would have been to negotiate (and dare I say it - compromise - to a conclusion, and not to draw so many partisan lines-in-the-sand. Ergo, it is partly a matter of President Obama's determination to win the argument on the basis of his rank, as opposed to adroit politics and personal diplomacy with fellow politicians, that he wasted many opportunities over the three years.

As for the tax cuts - it's just a fact that Obama has repeatedly been goaded into extending them. Who will be surprised if the ""Bush tax cuts"" are extended temporarily in the same fashion again? So why can't Obama convince his opposition that we need to raise taxes? Could it be because he's already succeeded in doing so with Obamacare?"
"In Star Wars, the shield is said to work similar to a highly-thermally-conductive material that has been ""projected"" out over the spacecraft; it responds to coherent energy spikes by decohering them and absorbing the energy, which in turn is re-radiated from radiators aboard the shielded ship. When those radiators reach their capacity to absorb energy and cannot radiate it fast enough, the shield fails. It does seem probable that ships are able to tune what degree of coherency is needed to ""activate"" the shield, as we've seen ships sit in close proximity to stars while protected by their shields - a situation that would not work if the shield only responded to coherent beam attacks alone.

Also note that there are two different types of shield - ray and particle. Ray works against lasers (which in Wars, ironically, are actually closer to particle-stream weapons) and particle against large physical projectiles. They often work in tandem - i.e., a particle shield would explode a missile early, so the missile is set to detonate before it actually impacts the shields. The explosion, in turn, is handled by both ray and particle shields.

A lightsaber would bounce off a ray shield, although it may penetrate a particle shield depending on how it is configured (i.e., a particle shield intended to contain a constant barrage of energy from a high-energy reactor leak would probably handle a lightsaber)."

>Religion was the motivation behind every mass killing and genocide in recent if not all history

I would disagree. Governments and political organizations were behind those. Sometimes they would attach some religious significance. Do you support anarchism because government kills people?

No, lets suggest that they were all almost entirely politically motivated with a few historical exceptions.

>go back in history, the Crusades, the Witch Hunts, the Inquisitions,

You have three examples from history and none are more recent than 4 centuries ago. Witch hunts pre-date organized religion and seem more rooted in popular folklore. This is not a stellar case against religion.

>People DO do horrible things, but why do you think they do them? they're raised and indoctrinated to believe their religion is the one true and right religion.

Yes indeed. There are a handful of people in the world that do such terrible acts in the name of their religion...and about 5 billion who are religious but do not commit such acts. The number of terrorists to religious adherents is about 20,000,000 to 1. If religion is such a dangerous idea, why are so few murderous extremists? 

Put another way, if religion is really the murderous ideology that you proport, shouldn't the vast majority of religious people be committing violent acts? If >1% of a secular organization were violent extremists would you suggest that the organization and its philosophy were causing extremism? Or would you see this as a problem of a few bad apples?

>I look forward to the day when deep-held religous convictions are looked upon as a mental disorder, or a hinderance to the human race.

"The sad thing is, I actually agree with this part:

> His fellow Arkansas State Rep. Loy Mauch (R-Bismarck) wrote a series of letters to the editor defending slavery, writing in 2009 “If slavery were so God-awful, why didn’t Jesus or Paul condemn it, why was it in the Constitution and why wasn’t there a war before 1861?”

Quite correct -- in fact, if the Bible has a position on slavery, it's that slavery is just fine, so long as you don't outright kill your slave. It's ok to beat them so badly that they die after a few days, though -- as long as they live for a day or two, you're fine.

I think the takeaway is that Jesus and Paul, these representatives, and a problematic percentage of the Founding Fathers, were all equally wrong about slavery. And if they were that wrong about slavery, we should be very suspicious about everything else they wrote. Yes, even the Constitution -- there's a reason we amended it so that blacks are whole persons, instead of three fifths of a person."

"> if the vision is every Bitcoin full node also becomes a Lightning node ... Then doesn't that just mean higher bandwidth and CPU and security requirements for everybody ?

It doesn't mean that: The difference is the blockchain is a flooding network, every full node eventually learns about every blockchain transaction. Lightning proposes way of using it which is scalable: only certain setup, shutdown, and disputes are seen by everyone. The rest of the (B|b)itcoin transactions are only seen by involved parties (a logarithmic number of nodes, under fairly weak topology assumptions). This means that adding participants adds capacity.

(The design also potentially incentivizes participation too; but even without that the improvement that many transactions go from everyone -sees to a-few-nodes-see is where the big scalablity improvement comes from)

* I woke up and there was a succubus sitting at the foot of my bed. She was grinning at me, and I distinctly remember her teeth were filed down into fangs. She didn't move, just sat there staring at me baring her teeth. Same thing as before--couldn't move, or wake up, or scream, though I tried as hard as I could.

* Napping with my girlfriend in a hotel in Paris, and I woke up--but I wasn't awake. My body was paralyzed, but my mind was wide awake. She was laying next to me, and I couldn't breath. You know how your breathing slows down when you sleep? That's what it was doing, but I was awake. It felt like my lungs just stopped automatically firing, and I couldn't control them. I finally broke out of it by focusing all my energy on moving my diaphragm. I woke up making little moans because I was trying to scream so loud. My girlfriend was like, ""What?""

* Napping in the student lounge of my major studies building on the couch, and I wake up. My classmate (who was working in the computer lab next door) was leaning over my face, seeing if I was awake. Another classmate (also in the lab) was standing in the doorway watching us. I was scared, so wanted to pretend to be asleep, so I didn't move (kind of like when you're a 4-year-old kid). They eventually left, and when I woke up for real (and totally confused), I asked them if they had gone in the lounge at all. They said no.

* A few weeks later, napping on a couch in a different studies building (yeah I had a messed up sleep schedule in college--who doesn't?), the same thing happened. My friend hovered over my face, seeing if I was awake, my other friend was watching in the doorway, and I got scared and pretended to be asleep. Again, they said they never entered that room with the couch when I asked them.

* More recently, I woke up in the middle of the night. Heard some noises from the hallway, and *knew* there was someone in the house going to rob us. Well, I have a knife next to the bed, but I found that I couldn't move. I was paralyzed. I got scared, but then woke up, realizing it was just a dream. Then I saw the burglar standing in the doorway to my bedroom. Again, I was paralyzed when I reached for my knife. I woke up again, relieved that *that* was just a dream. Then I saw the burglar had taken a few steps and was closer. Just standing there watching me. Once again, paralyzed. No knife. And once again, woke up, burglar at the foot of my bed, and I couldn't move or scream. Then I finally woke up *again*, and my room was empty--but I *knew* the burglar was in the hallway. The darkness out there was too ominous and my brain wouldn't let the image go away. So I swept the house, knife in hand, and, of course, there was no one there.

Based on my experiences, here is my theory. When you go into normal sleep, your body paralyzes itself to protect itself when you dream (so you don't punch or kick walls or whatever). It also slows your breathing down a *lot*, since you're in a reduced state and don't require as much oxygen (listen to your roommate's breathing next time, you'll see it's much, much slower than normal).

When you have a messed up sleep cycle, say, a lack of sleep or are in college and don't sleep at all, your body gets confused and sometimes gets the normal order of sleep *out* of order. So your body goes into sleep mode before you go unconscious--so you're paralyzed, and you're breathing is slower, but you're still awake.

That's where the Old Hag Syndrome comes in. I remember when I was a wee kid in Sunday school, this old lady said a demon tried to suffocate her one night by pressing down on her chest. She prayed to God to save her, and lo and behold--God answered her prayers and she woke up, the demon banished and her lungs working. All it was was sleep paralysis, and the sensation that she was suffocating from slow breath.

As for the standard and well-documented phenomena of seeing someone in the doorway or over your face, I think that's just an evolutionary holdover for survival. If you think you hear something at night, you'd better check it out because that's when you and your family are most vulnerable. Your brain will make you *think* someone is watching you, waiting to attack you, so you get up and go check and make sure no one is. At least that is my theory.

By the way, the above is not based on any science whatsoever--just on my experiences and sometimes logical thought processes."

I won't bake him a cake because he is a horrible human being.

All he probably learned from this is that other people can be just as horrible as he is.

>You act like a wild animal? You get put in with the wild animals.

This I agree, if they cannot respect the rules of our society, they should be put aside/contained until they do. This is how our society works, this is justice.

>We're not going to advocate to change the behavior of wild animals just because you don't like it.

No we're not, but we're not going to celebrate when the ""animals"" tear each other apart, because we are better than that, we are civilized.

Justice was already served, what happened after was just as cruel as the actions that put the guy in prison in the first place and that is not ok and saying that's a ""good thing"" is not ok."
"Well im sorry but your wrong. My overall point in my original post was that there exists a complex/hipster trend on the internet where people partake in this train of thought (which you also just showed me) towards star wars when ever they talk about it online. Its a very unfair bias 100% born out of insecurity, anger, spite and otherwise bad intentions which was then (over time when it eventually reached you for example) picked up by people who are casual/new fans and the process starts over again and just keeps feeding itself with forced memes and youtube rants with everyone trying to top everyone else until it only make sense that it is NOT star wars these people are fans/enthusiasts of it is BASHING star wars which they are fans/enthusiasts of. --and they wont admit it.

I dont partake in this. I have been a star wars fan all my life since I was 7 years old. I have been through it all online with people and what I came to realize is that with some of these people, they just REALLY cant let go of their hate. Its to the point where its like a cult. I am not exaggerating. Its sad too but its true. All it boils down to is that its a small but loud group of fanboys still obnoxiously yelling that ""the ones from OUR generation were the REAL ones maaan!"" and then you have the pretentious angry young white mails who are also insecure with their love/hate for SW who got brainwashed by those first people.

The truth is that normal, average people all around the world love star wars in general and probably wouldn't as much had it not been for everything that happened since 1997 and on which is everything the hateboys oh so proudly clam to hate -including ROTJ even!

I am a fan of George Lucas. I think that he is one of the most underrated artists of the past hundred years and I think he will go down in history as such. I am a fan of George Lucas films. I am a fan of the Star Wars Saga. And I am glad that the dream of completing his saga was realized and I am glad that 100 years from now people will still be watching these timeless classics --and NO ONE will remember or care who shot first a split second before who....or even what order they came out in for that matter. Thats just who I (and a great many others) feel.

If she was found dead in her home before the mission was even declared a failure, wouldn't people think:

a.) that she abandoned the mission early some how (or never went in the first place)

b.) she came back early and then committed suicide due to some kind of post depression

"> why aren't vim hotkeys like i3's default hotkeys?

I haven't actually been a collaborator when this decision was made, but my *guess* would be that it's because ""h"" is already used for horizontal split which actually makes a lot of sense. There might be another reason, though.

> wouldn't it be more intuitive if down key shrinks height and up key grows height?

That depends on what you're used to. Some coordinate systems in the IT world start at the lower left corner, which is your expectation. More often than that, though, they start in the upper left corner (most tools placing windows will work this way). And with this coordinate system the default behavior makes more sense.

> I changed layouts by accident and now the top left corner has a title bar that says ""S[Navigator]"". What is this and how is it useful?

""S[…]"" stands for ""stacked"" (the layout type) and it's just to give visual feedback to the user about what the container contains. The part inside the brackets will be the representation of all direct descendants in this container, which is either an application (then using the application's name) or another nested container. For tabbed layouts it will use ""T[…]"".

> Are the controls on i3 similar to other tiling managers such that it would be easy/intuitive in terms of figuring out the hotkeys 

Trust me, in a few weeks you won't have any problems if you were to switch to another window manager. You can always configure them to mirror the i3 behavior anyway. I wouldn't worry about this quite yet.

>  it seems that i3 window manager will not be developed for Wayland

Meh people love to overromanticise fast cars. Before i got my car Id hear how 4-500+ hp is way harder to control. It wasnt dificult at all and after a couple of months of owning it it just feels pedestrian now. I think the corners are the only part most people would struggle. The clutch/gear thing is just a thing every time you switch manuals (although I thought the DCT didn't have a pedal) since every car has a different bite point and rate. They're also running on tires they are pretty close to slicks. Cars don't stall outside of first gear so not sure what that would be about. The thing that would get most people is the turning. Most cars you slow down significantly to turn where F1 cars weight so little and have so much aero it might actually be beneficial to stay at a higher speed which is contrary to what most people are used to doing.

I'm trying to come too terms with it by saying that if i were born a girl, I would have had a childhood as a nerdy, socially awkward girl instead of as a nerdy socially awkward boy and the only thing that would be dramatically different would be having the right body and not having to go through all the crap I'm going through now. Another way to look at it is that you could have still been trans even if you were born with a female body and you would currently be sad because you didn't have a boyhood. One way too deal with some of it could be to have ""girl's nights"" with other trans women who are missing their girlhood. "

"In response to this, yes I am their tech. Forgive me for describing poorly as it matches much of the system here. I did not setup this network, for the life of me I have no idea why it this route was chosen. I am sorting it out currently and still trying to figure out exactly what is going on. 

Let me break it down for you as best I can:

1. Our ISP assigns a static address for internet access

2. Every Computer connects to the network by assigning an IP between .1 and .255 (of course)

3. When I started here, they had a meant for consumer d link router, needless to say, I took this off of the network. I replaced it with a Cisco Small Business router and I currently use it as an access point.

4. They are upset because now when you login to the wireless you have to assign an ip in order to gain access. This makes them unhappy because they liked how easy it was to hook up their phones and laptops to the company network /facepalm. 

 My basic question was, Is there a way to allow for DHCP lease on this network? I understand my post made little sense, I still have to figure out exactly whats going on here. I am working on fixing all of it. Just trying to get it in the right direction.

"I replied above with what I think a proper reading of the verse should be. I will add though that you picked a particularly slanted translation. 

>  And how does it address the many evil and tyrannical leaders if it supports their rule without question? 

I think the key to reading the passage is recognizing that the use of ""governing authorities"" is a different word than ""rulers"". The greek word of rulers (archon) is pretty clearly a state, but the word for ""governing authority"" is different than archon. So what is meant by ""governing authority"" is clearly something different than the state (archon). If they meant archon, then they would have said archon.

Therefore the only reference to hitler is where it says:

* For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. 

This doesn't suggest that we owe anything to the state. It's saying the state can not bring terror upon good people. The state does indeed make everything a crime nowadays, so as to make it appear they are fighting evil. Even the hardest statist will not accept their government throwing a good man into jail, no matter what lies they conjure up. So this verse applies even today."

"I don't know if it is all socialisation. I think we have some innate preferences. I always preferred the idea of being the damsel in distress rather than the knight in shining armor. 

Unfortunately, being male meant that if I was going to play any role in that dynamic it could only be the knight. To be the damsel would be shameful and I wouldn't be worth rescuing anyway.

If you've seen Miss Congeniality, the opening scene (or at least one of the early scenes, it's been a while since I last watched it) upsets me a little. It's a flashback to the main character's childhood. She sees a boy getting bullied by another boy and steps in to defend him. However, after she drives away the bully, the boy gets angry at her. He's ashamed that a girl protected him when he couldn't protect himself. If that boy had been me I think I would have immediately fallen in love.

I have mostly outgrown the idea. On an intellectual level at least I seen that neither role is healthy. In a relationship sometimes you'll each need to ""rescue"" the other but to think of one as the one always in need of help and the other always needing to help is harmful to both.

"I don't know, I've never worked in service industry, and most of my friends are in academia or programming. But from what I observe, there are these factors:

* There is a societal expectation of good service. If a company doesn't provide a good service, company suffers; so the companies are very much interested in keeping an appropriate level. This can go to ridiculous degrees, like daily morning motivational meetings with smiling practice for the whole staff.

* People take pride in doing their jobs well, whether they're cooks, servers or administrators, and ""doing their jobs well"" is mostly defined as keeping the customers happy. Again, this can go to ridiculous extremes, like always walking in a half-run to give appearance of swiftness and busyness. A perfect non-service example is, whenever I asked a passer-by something like ""Where is the post office?"", the answer would almost invariably be ""The post office? The post office is... well... let's see, the post office... It should be... I think... maybe ovvveeerrr th.. no, no, no... the post office... where was it again... hmmm... right, the post office... I'm sorry, I don't really know."" Duh. It can be annoying... but they have to show that they're treating your question seriously, putting in the effort, and not brushing you off.

There's Japanese who have jobs which are unimaginable in the west, because a) noone would pay them, b) noone would accept them. One of those is, for lack of a better word, pointer - people standing around and pointing people where to go, or not to go. An elevator on my metro station was under repairs for about a month. There was a little fence both on the street level and on the lower level, very obviously showing people that they can't use the elevator. But in addition, both above and belowground, there was permanently a person standing there, saying how the elevator was out of order, pointing people towards the stairs and apologising for the inconvenience. For a month. From 5am till 1am, the whole time the metro is operating. I've actually never seen a pointer move, I suppose aside from shift changes (I don't even know what they do with bathroom breaks). They look almost as serious about their job as a Buckingham Palace guard.

The point is, I won't ever worry if someone spit in my food. I will always be welcomed with a smile (even if a fake one, at times, but you'd never know). I will always be addressed with extra-polite speech. I will be returned any change, to the last yen, and if I tried to give them some I will be refused. (I think. I didn't try. I heard stories about waitstaff running after customers down the street with their ""forgotten money"" in hand.) I am never offered any suggestions unless I ask for one - the menu is there, plain for everyone to see, and anything I as a customer want, this is what they will bring me, expensive or not. (You get hawking for extra stuff in other places, like mobile phone companies, but I haven't yet gotten any from servers.) The waitstaff is usually quick to respond, and the food is brought out promptly.

I definitely got spoiled here. There is a factor of a different cuisine, but just this week I was at a restaurant for lunch and I was like ""OMG, it's been 20 minutes already since we ordered!"". Back in my original country I would not even blink at waiting 20 minutes for food to arrive.

There are differences in staff quality, definitely. I think they mostly correspond to what kind of place it is. Mom and pop places will normally serve only a small variety of things but be extremely good at them. Higher class restaurants will make you feel like princes, and they can explain every little detail. On the other hand, some part-time staff working in a chain restaurant will have to go and ask someone higher-up if asked if the free tea they give to every table is a green tea or barley tea.

A lot rests on reputation. People will line up for a store just because there's people being lined up for a store. If you eat something good in a restaurant and get great service, you're likely to go there again. If a dish is good, people will order it more. On the other hand if the place is not that good, the service not at the level the Japanese expect it to be, it will not survive for long in a city with the most restaurants per capita in the world.

Some allowances are made for foreigners. I've been to a Russian place, and just by looking at the server, it was obvious this was not a Japanese restaurant - not because she was caucasian, but because she wasn't smiling. I was actually like ""uh-oh, where did I wander into..."" Still, it went better than expected, again with food being brought fast and delicious. Otherwise, they wouldn't be there for long.

A reverse example was a newly-opened Chinese restaurant I went to, where they were nice enough, but really slow. We didn't think much of their survival chances. Indeed, they closed down in a couple of months.

Ugh. Wall of text. Sorry about that."

"I want to set up my response by reminding you of a classic joke:

A very wealthy man was on his first date with a gorgeous woman, and he thought he'd proposition her. He started out by asking her, ""Would you go to bed with me for a million dollars?"" After a startled pause, a smile came over her face and she replied, ""Yes, I would."" The man then asked, ""How about for twenty dollars?"" Angrily, she came back, ""What kind of woman do you think I am?!"", to which he replied, ""We've already established that; now we're just **haggling** over the price.""

> It's not discounted before the evidence is presented; there's no evidence. That's why it's a supernatural suggestion.

I dispute your claim that supernatural agency has no evidence.

In an earlier post, I discussed the account of atheist Norwood Russel Hanson. He claimed, with great seriousness, that there was indeed a natural event that he would interpret as demonstrating God's existence and His interaction with the natural world. Would you agree with Hanson that such an event would confirm for you a supernatural cause for a natural event? If so, then what you say is not true.

In that case, we just need to **haggle** over what constitutes evidence of supernatural agency.    ;-)"

"> I would remind you that the person in the article you linked to is himself refuting what another lawyer said, Harvard Law Professor Larry Lessig.

Incorrect.  Lessig himself agrees a crime was probably committed.  Lessig's position is that it shouldn't even be defined a crime, or at least, it should not be considered a felony.  Here are Lessig's words:
> First, of course, Aaron brought Aaron here. As I said when I wrote about the case (when obligations required I say something publicly), if what the government alleged was true — and I say “if” because I am not revealing what Aaron said to me then — then what he did was wrong. And if not legally wrong, then at least morally wrong. The causes that Aaron fought for are my causes too. But as much as I respect those who disagree with me about this, these means are not mine.

> But all this shows is that if the government proved its case, some punishment was appropriate. So what was that appropriate punishment? Was Aaron a terrorist? Or a cracker trying to profit from stolen goods? Or was this something completely different?

> ""Intellectual property"" is a made-up term with no real meaning.

Wrong.  First, for purposes of legal adjudication, the case law clearly establishes that IP is property.  Second, the fact that people are willing to pay for JSTOR access is proof positive that it is a sort of valuable property.

"Not looking for pity, just need an outlet I guess. I realize haven't been well mentally in a very long time, never had much of a family or many friends, my dad didn't want me and left, lots of stupid and sad stuff, etc. It became worse when I moved probably over a thousand miles from everyone I ever knew after losing my home, job/business and means to going to college. 

After moving to this new area, I've been basically in seclusion for 9 years now while honing my craft and making money from it. I developed online friendships and became attached to these people more than any real friends or family I ever had. It was easier to be myself and have no regrets. I didn't get embarrassed by people anymore, or have people try and pick fights with me, I changed from a violent person to someone who just wanted to be left alone. I was at peace for a short while, but still very lonely.

 A few years ago, I developed feelings for someone online who wanted me as a partner after talking for a few years, they were aggressive in a way and lobbied for us to be together. I never had someone go after me in a way, but this person was everything I wanted in a SO, we had a bond that we both never had before with anyone else. This other person wasn't exactly in good health mentally as well and faced their own demons, but we cared about each other deeply, we both just wanted someone to accept us for who we were unconditionally, someone to love us. 

After falling on hard times this year, they were there for me as anyone could be living 2000 miles away. My health started going south and I could no longer work until I got well. During this period, our plans to meet fell apart, and so did the person's feelings for me apparently, they thought I maybe took them for granted, when this person was on my mind 24 hours a day. Maybe I didn't do enough, it's all that clouds my mind now, any declarations of feelings or gifts from the heart are met with being completely ignored nowadays.

Now I'm in a complete downward spiral. I have panic attacks every day, multiple ones every few hours, it drives me to the brink of tears and I don't know what to do. All I can think about are all the people who have abandoned me in my life and how I'm not worth loving or being cared about, when I tried to show them otherwise. I've been around to listen to anyone's problems and help them in most any way, but as I feel this way I find no one is there or will make time for me. I feel used, unappreciated, and thrown away. Most of all I'm tired of being in pain every day. People can only take so much, I thought I could ride out my years on earth until I achieved some form of happiness through hard work. But now all I want is my pain to end. I'm not the best person, I wanted to be happy for once in my life. 

If you're with your family and friends and have a good or even ""decent"" relationship with them, please don't take it for granted. These people will help shape your life, and it won't always be good, but it will help you in the long run be a better and happier person. I can only speak from the experience of not having that most of my life. All I can do is leave that for anyone who thinks they have no one to turn to.

And if you truly don't? At least know there are others who know and share that pain. That might not be enough though, as it isn't for me."

No when they're reloading or when someone gets the jump on them. In Arizona someone tackled Jared Lee Loughner when he was reloading and in Seattle a kid pepper sprayed the shooter while he was still shooting. Neither of them were ""tired of killing"" so wrong again.

>There is a significant correlation between reduces restrictions on legal carry of firearms and reduced murder and other violent crime rates.

Yeah there are very strong correlations between tighter restrictions on legal carry and reduced murder. NYC has the lowest per capita murder rate in the U.S. and some of the strongest gun laws in the country. Conversely the highest murder per capita states often have the least restrictive carry laws. Louisiana for instance has very relaxed laws on carry and has the highest murder per capita rate. This is often true around the world. America has the highest murder per capita rate among first world countries, no one else comes close, and the loosest restrictions on firearm carrying. Conversely, countries like England and Australia have very strict laws and lower murder rates. England has 1/3 the murder rate of America and has an outright ban on firearms. Wrong for a 3rd time.

I'm interested as to your argument for why this means we may not study the function of wealth within those societies and within our present society.

>Yes and women can have just as much right to an athletic scholarship or a job in the police, fireservice or the military when they can beat all the male candidates as well.

>Is that why things like the wage gap is still framed as discrimination when we have clear evidence that the inputs are different?

I don't think any critically thinking person still frames the wage gap as primarily explainable by active, conscious, calculated discrimination in the context of a workplace. Instead, it is primarily explainable by the greater presence of privilege society-wide.

>It seems such ideologies want to find a barrier and ignores differing inputs, and assumes such differences must be due to different treatment.

It may seem that way to you, but why should it seem that way to anyone else?

>It seems such ideologies want to find a barrier and ignores differing inputs, and assumes such differences must be due to different treatment.

Quite not. We may start with an observation of a gender-based difference, but study upon study is done to support explanations for these observations. If you think we simply point to the wage gap and say, ""See? That means there must be barriers"", you have not been paying attention.

>I'd say criticizing a political ideology that allows the perpetuation of holding men down for the benefit of women would be subject to the same criticism, but since privilege is defined in a way that doesn't recognize other forms of power or lower barriers to other aspects of society, I imagine you wouldn't acknowledge it.

Maybe if they had cut back to the family telling the story once or twice during the flashback it would've given them the chance to take more advantage of this framing device, but as is it's at least unique. 

[](/ajlie) And I do like how it sort of show that AJ wasn't always the perfect element of honesty she is now, and that she's made some kind-of embarrassing mistakes too, and how they shaped her into the pony she is today. That was kind of interesting to see, get a little backstory. Same with Big Mac and his speaking/lack thereof. I like that that's a legit character point of his now and not just a joke.

[](/sp)

[](/absmile)Going back to the ending scene and Bloom spouting the moral, I like how she interpreted it a little differently than ""lying is bad"", but rather ""we all make mistakes and that shapes who we are"", which for Apple Bloom's arc specifically is a much more fitting moral, and helps set her apart from just being a younger clone of her older sister, who took the moral of the events that transpired as the simple ""don't lie"" moral. That was a great way to present the moral and I really liked it.

[](/sp)

[](/ajhappy) Not to mention, we got a flashback to a time period we haven't seen yet; when the Mane 6 were teenagers, post-cutie mark but pre-pilot. That was nice, even if AJ was the only one that appeared.

[](/sp)

[](/abmeh) But that's about the extent of interesting things there is to say about the episode proper. Aside from some key scenes and elements, it was still a lackluster story overall.

[](/sp)

[](/abhuh) But now we have to get into two things that piqued my interest about this episode that had little bearing on the story but by far are the most interesting things to talk about.

For one: their ages and Apple Bloom's birth. See, I'd always assumed (and though the general consensus was) that the Mane 6 were in the early 20's range (we know they're all 21 or above because they can drink cider) with AJ being the oldest (I'd put her around 23-24), Mac being about a year or two older, the CMC were very early tween/teenagers (12-14), and Granny Smith was in her, say, 70's. 

[](/sp)

[](/hmmm) Apple Bloom did not appear in the flashback. Not as a baby, not in the background, nowhere. Since it has been implied to the point of basically being canon, we know AJ's parents are dead, and since they're nowhere to be seen in the flashback, we can assume they were dead at this point in time as well. In the flashback, AJ looks to be a few years older than the CMC are currently (say, 14-16) and Mac would be... 17-18, maybe? Granny being in her 60's at least checks out. I figured this flashback would've taken place between 5 years and a decade ago, but that would mean Apple Bloom would have likely been born by then, which she was not. But if the parents were dead, or even just long-gone to the point of not being mentioned at all, at this point, and Apple Bloom doesn't exist yet, then... where does she fall into the equation? She's probably not adopted - she did get an Apple cutie mark after all, and AJ's treatment of her like a biological sister has always been very natural, not to mention the whole ""no lying"" policy of hers brought up in this very episode, so that's pretty thoroughly ruled out. So this means I need to reconsider either Apple Bloom's age or when the Apple parents died or both.

[](/paperbagderpy) And then there's one little moment in the hospital that I know the fandom is going to go nuts over; Derpy. There was a short scene in the hospital where we saw Derpy with bandages over her eyes. This means not only that she wasn't born with the cross eyes, but that she clearly sustained some kind of traumatic injury. Maybe that's not only the reason for her eyes, but also the reason she has such disabilities? Ooh, I can't wait for all the tragic fanfics. Writers, get on that.

[](/sp)

[](/eeyup) In conclusion, this is an episode that's got a lot more going on in the background and fine details than it does in the actual story. It's a pretty paint-by-numbers story that became a bit of a bore to sit through at times - *again* with the predictability - but with a decent framing device, some cool info on what the characters were like in their past, and a unique way of delivering its moral while being ripe for analysis.

In other words, s'allrightiguess.

"A little off topic, but it's funny to see left-wing types so much in favor of Uber. I don't think they would have been unless they were given a chance to see it in action because deregulation is always a dark money plot to crush the common man, according to the blogs that they read. Uber is lucky to have found it's way into a very gray area outside of regulation, because otherwise I am very confident that I would be called a crazy and naive libertarian for suggesting that deregulating and privatizing taxis would be good for consumers. 

""It would be too dangerous! Would the free market fairy inspect their cars too? LOL"" 
""They would jack up their prices because they only care about profit, not people!""
Or the more sophisticated ones: ""It wouldn't work due to information asymmetry. The driver knows more about traffic conditions than the passenger, so they'll purposely take the long way to increase profits.""

The real danger of regulation is that it kills ideas before they're implemented.

"Hi, i'm an IRC developer (InspIRCd)!

>In particular I hate its tree topology leading in user-visible disruption when a server dies. At least nickserv and chanserv have been implemented in some IRC networks to reduce the annoying impact (not in IRCnet of course).

IRCv3.2 recently introduced the NETSPLIT and NETJOIN batch types which should help clients reduce the visible disruption from this. It admittedly isn't very widely implemented yet though.

>Protocol message is limited to 512 octets

With IRCv3.2 the line length is 1024, and in some implementations (e.g. InspIRCd) you can change the line length to whatever you want. 

>There is no 'invisible' metadata you could add to (ie.) PRIVMSGs, so extending the protocol is basically impossible because clients not supporting any extension would just annoy the user.

You can do this with IRCv3.2 message tags. In the draft version of IRCv3.3 we also have a method for users to tag messages with semantic information like ""no-reply"", or ""whisper"".

>Each participant needs to maintain their own logs instead of keeping it in the one place that could do it efficiently, the server. This also leads to people asking 'my connection got cut off, did someone answer to me'

InspIRCd can do this with m_chanhistory. I have a WIP specification to standardise it for IRCv3.3 too.

>Mobile use is not great and most IRCers don't really use any local IRC client in their mobiles. People typically run a separate IRC session somewhere and log into that either via SSH (and get a terminal-based chat), use a proxy-based solution such as irssi proxy inheriting the downsides of the IRC protocol or use a proprietary protocol such as WeeChat's. Or they use another approach altogether, I've heard some use XMPP (geddit? use another protocol to use IRC?). But IRC certainly isn't helping here.

This is probably one of the biggest problems with IRC. We are working on it.

>In particular the people that do choose to use IRC directly from the mobile may end up being kickbanned from channels due to intermittent connectivity, and still no guarantee of message delivery.

IRCv3.2 introduces echo-message which can be used to let people know their message arrived at the server. IRCv3.3 will improve this by adding a message of linking messages to their replies via ids.

>File sharing.. Well DCC maybe worked reliably out-of-the-box in the 90s. IRC doesn't give a system to store files channel-wide in a easy-to-use fashion.

You are correct about the latter but DCC should work reliably out-of-the-box in any modern client.

"in response to: ""THEY WILL SLAUGHTER YOU"", actually I have talked to a numbr of them, and it hasnt been that bad. This is a new argument i came across that i posted above. The whole point of the above argument was something like this:

2) being an atheist is not very scientific, since you dont have a solid reason, nor a proof, for your beliefs. your position is unjustified as a result
3) as the above was quite easy, a more interesting option is to take up an agnostic position. since then, we have an open-minded person who doesnot know which side to be on. then we can have a more intersting discussion of what seems more plausible.

(my reply not detailed since i havent thought much about it)

In other words, an atheist's position is not very strong, and i dont want to keep thinking about atheists since they dont have a very solid footing. but an agnostic's footing is more worthy to be addressed.

But that is just a way of testing the strength and endurance of particular muscle groups - either way, you are raising your chin above the bar - which is the ultimate goal of a pullup.

You could also extend this to doing box jumps by jumping higher so that you land with your legs completely extended - in that way, you would have to jump much higher. You would be able to do fewer repetitions because you would be doing a less efficient form of the exercise.

But would you expect someone who does a box jump by jumping the least height possible and then standing up at the end to not count their exercise as a box jump simply because they had chosen a more efficient methodology of doing the exercise?

Crossfit is about learning the most efficient means of accomplishing tasks. It's about bringing more muscle groups to bear to achieve a given result. A standard pullup is not the most efficient way to pull your head above a bar. If you want to gripe that the definition of a pullup is to straight-arm and hang free, then great. Do them that way. But don't get mad when someone else chooses a more efficient way to accomplish the same task."
"You know, it's all very well to wring your hands about the Tea Party, and I agree of course that this is a very deliberate, and successful, strategy on the part of the fossil fuel industry to destroy the competition. But you have to wonder where are the rest of the Americans on this. Why aren't Americans who want a clean environment and a successful renewable energy industry out there fighting the greedy corporate interests tooth and nail? Where's the spirit of innovation and  progress? Why do the Republicans have a majority in Congress anyway? Why is the fossil fuel industry allowed to get away with this with no resistance at all?

>But that brief control of the Senate that enabled the Recovery Act was over with the death of Ted Kennedy in mid 2009, giving the GOP de facto “minority rule” over what bills could be voted on, and killing the climate bill that the most progressive House in a decade had easily been able to pass.

Really? Ted Kennedy dies, and it's curtains for any progressive initiatives in Congress?"
"""saying her deeply held Christian beliefs don't let her endorse gay marriages.""

Sorry Christians ... I know you're not all dicks, but until you kick tossers like this out of your number, it'll be hard not to paint you all with the same brush."
"During the unboxing livestream, a LEGO designer said that they only had concept sketches to work off of, as well as very little info. Suffice to say, the scenario was the same for other toy companies. It's pretty apparent that Kylo's Shuttle went through quite a few changes during the film's production, but the toys had to be ready for Force Friday, therefore they were produced before some of the changes were made.    

It is slightly weird that Hasbro and LEGO have differing colours, as well as Hasbro having differing colours within their several lines of toys. I'd say that the LEGO version is the most accurate, based on what we saw in Teaser #2.    

Also, obligatory pic of my LEGO Kylo Ren's Command Shuttle.    

The pictures don't quite do it justice; it's pretty massive."

"So, OK, I'm really curious.  What do you think this law should be, ""to deal with all the unmedicated psychotics running around?""  I hear a lot of the pro-gun side saying variations on this, but I've never heard what the actual proposal is.

What exact law do you folks think should be passed? "
">Porn is not free. It costs money to make, and the people making it are making profit, otherwise they wouldn't be doing it. You may not directly pay for watching a video, but you do see adds. What matters is that the people engaging in the sex are getting money for it, either as an up-front acting free, a royalty from selling it, or advertising revenue.

I dont pay money to watch it I pay money for the internet and my computer, but the optional porn is free.

It's about as immoral as exploiting sweatshops. Sweatshops are a product of an unfair world but it would be unethical to get rid of them because people wouldnt work there if they have better options for work.

You're still exploiting a woman who is a victim of a primitive and sometimes sick society."
"> This works to combat dogmatism by looking at things on a case-by-case basis and examining things through more of a cost-benefit perspective.

So nothing would be off limits, just as long as the cost-benefit ratio was in our favor?
