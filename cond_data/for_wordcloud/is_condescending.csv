> ""Both can be demonstrated wrong."" If a theory needs to be changed, it's because it was wrong before.

See, I don't even know how to start. No, see, theories are constantly growing and evolving and self-correcting. Nobody is going to disprove General Relativity. There might be some small piece that's incorrect, but eventually someone will come along and correct it without making a significant change to what we consider 'The Theory of General Relativity.'

> We can't show theories to be correct in every circumstance.

Sigh. Fine. Every scientific theory has been rigorously shown to be correct in every conceivable circumstance. 

 > theories only need to be ""supported by a vast body of evidence,"" which is a much lower standard of proof.

This is always what trips up scientists. We use weasel words among ourselves to be precise because so much of science is probabilistic. There is a small but non-zero chance that all of the air in your room will head to the corner, leaving you choking on vacuum. But it's probably not going to happen.

If a piece of evidence doesn't support a theory, it's either a problem with the theory or with the evidence. In practice, scientists do screw up, and corrupt their evidence. That's why we repeat experiments. I don't think this is what the National Academy means when it says ""vast body of evidence,"" though. 

What they mean, is that there are many different types of experiments, mathematical proofs, computational analysis, and observational studies that support a theory. That is, not that it's a majority of the evidence, but rather a consensus or unanimity. 

Scientists often refer to the ""scientific consensus"" when they are talking about something that may contradict what is currently known, rather than something that is currently unknown. "

> Hatsu is the end result of that. You are correct when you say that it is ""putting the aura to use in order to act."" However, it is only truly Hatsu when the aura materializes in order to carry out the will of the user, and it always abides by certain conditions. Gon tossing a ball of aura was not a Hatsu. It was an exercise useful in developing an Emission Hatsu, but the technique itself was not Hatsu. It is not Hatsu until you assign it a particular set of instructions, in which case, again, it always abides by a certain conditions.

I mean, your interpretation is nice and all, but where is your source for all this? It just seems like something you came up with. You have to talk according to the manga for it to be acceptable. Find a page where it says it's mandatory to have conditions in hatsu, and then it'll be acceptable.

> Killua's thunder palm condition would be that the Hatsu also hurts the user. Killua had to build up a tolerance to electricity as a prerequisite and voluntarily causes pain to himself every time he uses it. Kurapika's would depend on what each chain does, as each of his chain would warrant an individual Hatsu.

The Killua example was brought up by yourself. But if you now think it has conditions, no problem, I'll put it aside. But about Kurapika, my point remains the same. The only conditions Kurapika has mentioned, are for the special functions of his chains. If he was fine with just using his chains as whips, that was a hatsu without conditions.

> You wouldn't need to use manipulation aura if you're not controlling them in the same way a manipulator would.

I can't imagine how it's possible to control something with aura in a way that is not manipulation, but ok let's assume it's as you say. The problem is that specialist is a special category. And in case of specialists themselves, an outsider special category like that doesn't exist.

>I am going for a degree in philosophy so I hope it is well informed

I have one, and I've done graduate work, too. Let's see if I can help:

In order for life to have intrinsic meaning, that meaning must be found within the thing in and of itself. Life, itself, then, must contain its own meaning. Otherwise, it's not the ""meaning of life"" but the meaning of whatever the thing really is.

So, if the meaning of life is God, then God cannot possibly be the meaning of life at all; God would be the meaning of God, and God alone. God is not intrinsic to life. In fact, if you're a believer of the bible, God existed before creation, so God is not intrinsic to anything. God precedes everything. 

I will say again at the risk of repeating myself. The meaning of life must necessarily be something within life itself, not something external. 

This is why I don't approve of giving existentialism to teenagers without a proper background in greek and medieval philosophy (as well as at least formal logic) - it's dangerous! 

I would recommend you take a look, if you haven't already, at Republic (specifically books VI and VII, please avoid Jowett translations, and read slowly), and at Existenz by Jaspers. You may also find some value at this point in I and Thou, by Buber, if you haven't looked at any of his work."
"The best thing you can do is learn to plan your dive and dive your plan.

PADI teaches you how to avoid getting bent. But most new divers won't approach their NDL limits unless they're doing deep repetitive dives (like 3+ dives per day <100 fsw). New divers have gas consumption rates that are simply too high to let them get close to NDL unless they're diving doubles.

You need to learn how to write a safe dive plan, which means understanding how your consumption rate will affect how much time you can spend in the three phases of the dive - descent, dive ops, ascent, while still retaining sufficient gas to act as an emergency reserve for your buddy, and having enough gas left in the tank to avoid dropping below the minimum necessary for the tank to remain in a ""safe"" condition (i.e. 500psi).

Once you know how to craft a dive plan the next thing you need to learn to do is how to conduct a safe ascent. Safe ascents from 30fsw to the surface require you to master the art of hitting a fixed depth and holding that depth without rising or falling in depth for a pre-determined amount of time. Ideal safe ascents begin at 30fsw and increment in 5 foot units for 1 minute per all the way to the surface.

Finally, the third thing you need to do is practice your Out of Air (OOA) drills with your buddy. You should both become comfortable enough with the procedure that you can do it without altering your depth. You can combine these drills with your safe ascents when you're good enough at holding depth to manage it.

Basically until you have reached a level of proficiency with your skills and knowledge about dive planning, you aren't going to become a safer diver.

The Rescue Diver class, by the way, isn't about making you a safer diver. It's about teaching you the skills you will need to respond if someone else has an accident or a health emergency. There are great parts of the Rescue Diver curricula including learning/refreshing CPR and how to make a site-specific emergency plan, and I encourage you to take it, but just remember that the class is about helping others not helping you.

Finally, don't get a pony bottle. It's extra gear (more points of failure), requires you to master a set of skills (deploying the pony reg in an emergency) that you should not bother with until you have mastered dive planning, safe ascents and OOA drills, and worse, if you become complacent about bad behavior on the part of your buddies (or you!) and Bad Things Happen it might be the day you discover your pony bottle leaks and is empty, your pony reg is broken, you can't get the valve open, or worst case, the person in distress is your buddy and is nowhere near you when they have an emergency.

STAY WITH YOUR BUDDY. That's an affirmative obligation. Your buddy's job is not to stay with you, it's your job to stay with your buddy. A portion of the gas in your tank is what saves your buddy's life on the worst day of diving they'll ever have."

"As we all learned in civics class in high school, the rights of one person end where the rights of another person begin. You seem to be (and please correct me if I am misunderstanding) defining control of women as meaning placing any limitations on her whatsoever. I think it's meaningful to distinguish between limitations place on women as a class, versus those placed on women because they happen to be more intimately involved with the process by which human life is brought into being. I am opposed to the former, but in favor of the latter. But I wouldn't define such limitations as ""controlling women"", any more than I would say that telling a thief he can't steal is placing limitations on the thief.

Most pro-lifers would not be against abortion in the extreme case of an ectopic pregnancy, or for that matter in any situation in which the life of the mother were actually involved. The problem is that pro-choice people try to use broadly and vaguely defined ""health of the mother"" clauses as loopholes to permit abortions of any kind, at any time. You keep pointing to extreme examples of people who want to, as you say, end enforcement of child support, or call women who want to get abortions nasty names. Most people who are anti-choice are not driven by a lust for controlling and harming women, and I don't know what pro-lifers you are talking about who would prefer a woman to die from an abortion than not get pregnant in the first place. I'm sorry if you've had a bad experience with a particularly nasty set of people, but that is not what the pro-life movement is about.

Pro-lifers want there to be no abortions, period, just as those against capital punishment (like myself) want there to be no more state-sponsored executions. In the case of capital punishment, that may anger the families of victims of some very horrible crimes, but that is beside the point. The point is that humans shouldn't be taking the lives of other humans.

Which brings us back to my point that this is about life, which you have never responded to. If you think that a woman should be able to terminate a pregnancy, for any reason, at any point, then there is no reason that she shouldn't be able to have a young newborn also medically disposed of. If you believe that disallowing that is controlling a woman, then I don't think we have any common ground on which to come to an understanding. And if you don't think she should be able to, then you have some seriously difficult questions to ask yourself about exactly when the rights of a fetus or child take precedence over the rights of the woman who happened to bring it into the world.

In the same timeframe that it takes Panth to QWE someone Zed's already ulted, used his moves/autoattacked/botrk and then fucked off. Panth is left standing there, if he didn't get a kill he has to chase it.

You do realise that timeframe is literally a single second right? Panth can easily burst down any squishy unless they have defensive items in a single second without worry. The fact that you think Panth cannot quickly burst down squishies just shows that you don't know jackshit.

>Or are you just being selective because you're salty about getting wrecked by him one game?

Quite the opposite actually. I got 20 games with him at the end of last season and preseason, with only 5 of them being losses.

>Well considering he's losing a 0.6 AD ratio, as well as Base damage on the spell.. It is a pretty big nerf indeed.

Okay this is the point where you pretty much admitted you have no idea what you are talking about.

Minus 0.6 bonus AD ratio. On a spell with........ 3.6 bonus AD ratio. Literally 1/6 of it's damage. Also the base damage nerf is minimal. It's only 40 damage less at max rank. With the ratio and the base combined, that's literally less than a fraction of it's damage.

In fact, I'm %100 sure that the ult nerf will hurt him more. His Q is already strong in lane. 

Also, something you said previously, you are correct, they don't want him to be played toplane. Because Panth's harass has no counterplay currently. It's a skill that ""You click, something happens, there is nothing enemy can do about it."". It's the same reason why Riot reworked Shen and Ryze.

"Did you read what I said? More sales meant MORE employees and/or more hours for said employees.

You do realise that kiosks aren't actually automation in the traditional sense? This isn't a case of a robot cooking all the food. It's self service for the fast food sector, and essentially having 6 kiosks being able to take 6 orders all at once (+2 traditionally manned tills) actually reduces service bottlenecks and pushes the bottleneck to the kitchen - which in turn requires more people in a kitchen to reduce that bottleneck. Those 6 people that would have originally manned tills during high volume periods now work in a kitchen instead - so now we get higher volume sales while still employing the same number of people, if not more.

Should they be paid more as now they're working harder to counter balance higher volume? Yes. But that's not really what I'm saying here. Kiosk stores don't destroy jobs. Period."

Lots of ideas packed in there, but I can't say I agree with you on a few points.

""The law"" is kind of an abstraction, so you must be talking about the individuals who work for government, implementing public policy and enforcing laws and regulations. The fact is that even the poorest and most disadvantaged people in our society can be helped by ""the law."" For example, childrens' services agencies routinely save kids from abuse and neglect by their parents or other people. You don't really expect children to shoot their parents in self defense, do you?

As for this bit of wisdom: ""our civilization is based on the right of each individual to secure his right to life, and it is this mutual recognition which is the reason why we cooperate on things like rule of law.""

Okay, history lesson. Lehi members joined the Herut party which was part of Jabowtinsky's idealogical movement like them.

Before that they were ostracised from government positions by the left wing coalition. Is that clear?

>You should read about the White Buses - Bernadotte was no Stalin, and to suggest that he was reflects a basic unfamiliarity with the story of a pretty remarkable man who risked life and limb to rescue victims of Nazism.

You should really read about the white buses. Bernadotte was second in command of the Swedish red cross, he never risked his life. His subordinates risked their life and not because of the Nazis (what they did was in accordance with the Nazis) but because they could have accidentally been hit in combat zones. The plan wasn't initiated or thought of by him and he only negotiated with the Nazis for them to agree with it. I have more respect for a pole which hid one Jew in his attic at the risk of having his whole family executed than a functionary who simply did his duty and was never in any actual risk. Unless you think the Nazis intended to shoot him in the middle of negotiations.

>Shamir should no more be regarded as a hero than Yigal Amir.

Really wrong comparison there. Yigal Amir, a person which assassinated an elected PM and never contributed anything to Israel is not the same as a man who endangered his life and freedom for Israel and worked all his life for its establishment and well-being.

Edit: Realized I might have been to harsh on Bernadotte so I'll put in a clarification. Bernadotte did his job, he did it well and he saved innocent lives, had another less talented man been negotiating with the Nazis maybe less people would have been saved. However in this site I have encountered many times the belief that Bernadotte was some saint who saved Jews at personal risk and would have ended the Israeli Palestinian conflict had he not been murdered by the vile Zionists. This is not true, he never put his life or standing on the line during the holocaust and his proposals would never have been accepted by the Israelis and I seriously doubt even the Arabs would have agreed to them."

I'm not trying to say that all Chinese are stupid. That is fallacious. But the problem is that logic, critical thinking and especially imagination are not as important to that society as obedience. And putting obedience first does tend to lead to some really illogical interactions.

Okay, I see you're a bit confused there. I'm saying that a naive comparison of regulated prices minus the cost of quota can't be compared to the profits that would come from those same regulated prices if farmers didn't have to pay for quotas. 

If you got rid of regulated prices and the quotas, the major difference isn't that prices are higher or lower, but that they're highly unstable. And there's no reason to expect any change at the retail price level either way. I know it's not an easy concept, but it does work in economic terms. "

He turned 17 a few weeks ago, he knows he can't challenge for a first team place because he's not an idiot. He's not even played a full season of EDS and still has a way to go before he's the best player on the pitch at that level, let alone first team level.

What he will get is invited to first team training, 1 on 1 time with Pep, a place on the preseason tour, and if he keeps playing well, he'll make his debut soon like Diaz did.

Not true. Sterling was a few months away from some cameo sub appearances - the equivalent of Sancho getting given a league cup cameo in October/November. Liverpool were also completely shite back then and Sancho knew when he joined he'd have to get past better players than Sterling did at Liverpool.

>so was Messi

Not true, a comparison to possibly the greatest player of all time is ridiculous, but even he was older than Sancho when he started competing for the first team.

Also not true. Sané was over 2 years older than Sancho now when he made his league debut for Schalke.

You don't have a right to know. The ""medical history"" line isn't the reason you wanted to know who your biological father was. That's a lie children use to justify whatever really drives their obsession to find the ""truth"". There are lot of children out there who do not know who their biological father is, either because their mother doesn't know, or the father left, or died, or because some women don't tell the truth on birth certificates. No one is rushing to give them DNA tests to protect their rights.

"""Well he never made these claims til after MJ died, so excuse me for not rushing to believe him. He was part of the Johnny Young Talent Group, which is like our equivalent of Broadway for kids, I guess, so it wouldn't be unusual for them to hold dance contests.""

This is an attempt to discredit Wade because he waited a long time to report it. This is a common thing to do. The reality is, people who haven't been abused or groomed have a real trouble to understand the behavior of victims. It's common for people in Wade's alleged situation to perceive their abuse, not as abuse, but as normal. These children weren't forced into sexual situations but were coerced and they willingly performed sexual acts. In that way, there is the element of abuse victims not seeing themselves as victims. Often, a big life moment that occurs in the victim makes them re-evaluate their past, in this case it was Wade's baby boy that was born. He had a nervous breakdown as a result.

Again, I can't stress this enough. We shouldn't believe Wade 100% yet, but don't dismiss him because his behaviour doesn't match with what you consider to be a reasonable person - if he has been abused then his behaviour is prone to be different. 

(Also note that not only Wade is in litigation, also Jimmy Safechuck is)


""It's not feasible at all! Michael is an entertainer, of course he'd be looking for the next big talent or dancers to be in his videos. Is anyone side eyeing Missy Elliott for hiring countless children to dance in her videos? Beyonce signed two teens to her label, is her behaviour creepy or suspicious? It's nothing new and certainly nothing suspicious for industry power figures to go hunting for young talent. You'd be accusing 99% of the entertainment industry of pedophilia. Showbiz careers take years to form, then even more time to establish an audience/fanbase. Most stars sign young so by the time they're well known, they're still only 21 or so.""


Okay, point taken, but Wade slept in MJ's bed - Beyonce isn't sleeping with her potential stars. Also, Jordi Chandler and Jimmy Safechuck were not performers - amongst others. 


""If that man is only sharing his room and/or bed with close family friends whose parents are fully aware of the situation and have given permission - which is all that was happening - then no, I would not suspect anything unless given a reason to. Michael even said himself he would NOT let his own kids sleep in a strange man's bed, only family friends. He said the only reason kids were in his bed is because they were too scared to sleep alone in other parts of the mansion and because they asked to sleep in the bed rather than on the floor:
Source: He explains here that he was sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag, then reiterates that he shared a bed with Macaulay Culkin and his siblings, aka close family friends (Culkin attended Michael's funeral and testified at his trial).""


Again, this is a common issue. Your only source of information, or your main source, is the potential culprit himself...MJ! Of course he's going to say he didn't sleep with these boys. You might aswell not mention that. MJ played the image game - he didn't always tell the truth. Consider his excuses for his plastic surgeries, him claiming he didn't bleach his skin, him claiming he's not anti-Semitic yet he did hold those beliefs (there's a reason he wrote ""jew me)"". He clearly had more than 2 surgeries and it wasn't due to breaking your nose - you don't need to make your nose smaller when you break your nose! It's actually laughable that one flies by. The point is, MJ isn't the beacon of truth - he knew that he had to say the right things. (By the way, don't get side tracked by that, you may well think actually MJ was telling the truth about all of the above but I'm not interested to debate that)

Why don't you look at the evidence in the 2004 trial? Why don't you hear the accounts of the various people who worked in neverland? You would do yourself a great service if you did. Honestly, read some of their accounts - not just MJs. Read what happened in the Chandler case. He was sleeping in his bed all the time!

Remember, on record, the jury in the 2004 case after seeing all the evidence were convinced MJ was a pedophile, however, they could not be certain that he abused this particular victim therefore they acquitted.


""Wow, now ""Michael Jackson hired a young dancer to be in his music video"" is a ""multitude of evidence"" to suggest he's a child molester? Are you serious?""


My multitude of evidence doesn't pertain to Wade. Since the mid 80s MJ has had a string of boyfriends, always boys aged 8-13 who he was very very close with. I mean that's a fact you can't deny, he was always close with boys of that age, never girls. Ask yourself how a family who aren't that wealthy could get $20million from a man who can afford the best legal team on the planet (Jordi Chandler). You don't pay out that much and choose not to clear your name for no reason.



I mean, do some research outside of these MJ fansites - they're incredibly biased. Remember, no one knew MJ, you think you did, but you didn't. You knew a part of him, the part he chose to display. Don't discount that he could exhibit these criminal behaviours just because he's a great singer and a great dancer. He didn't give the world all of his personality. 

Listen, no one more than me wishes MJ was not a paedophile, I am obsessed with his talents. But after doing reading from credible sources (none of which have come from a pro-MJ website because honestly, it's full of shit for various reasons) it is clear to me he was a pedophile.

mjfacts.com for actual quoted sources, they will provide you iron clad sources for all of their claims. 

I love the truth however, in a way, I don't want you to uncover it because it is nice to not think of MJ as a pedophile. But over time I've learnt to separate his music from the man.

Since I started teaching, the state standards have been rewritten twice; we have gone through three reading curriculum adoptions, not to mention math, science, and social studies, and I have taught five different grade levels. All of that requires thoughtful, intentional planning. 

Teachers are required, by their state licensing board, to accumulate a certain number of professional development credits (continuious learning) for certificate renewal. Each state structures this differently. Some provide courses for teachers, others leave it up to teachers to find and pay for it on their own.

I also find the numbers in you cite for IT to add a certain level of ironic humor to this conversation. If you are a teacher in the Bay area, you make on average $59,000/year.

These arguments often boil down to picking a thing that is partially example of a larger label, but in some ways it is also an outlier example compared to the most iconic central examples that the label evokes.
These arguments' goal is not to bringing up new, unknown information about their subject matters, but abusing the dictionary so a thing will be looked at differently if we categorize it together with a larger label. (No one is raising new scientific data of what an abortion involves, just that we should frown upon it because the dictionary applies the same word to it, as to a man shooting you in the face)

In the case of racism, we all understand, that the term ""racism"" was popularized as a description of nazi politics, and the way it ideologically motivated by a belief in racial hierarchies. Later it got applied to American white supremacist politicians, who rejected the term, taking it as an unfair accusation. So it entered the discourse as that, as an accusation of an intended oppressive political agenda. 

Even if today, you can find dictionaries that for brevity's sake define racism just as ""negative beliefs about a race"", or somethig like that, it is undeniable that the term is dripping with a heavy accusation, that the one called ""racist"" is about to bring back the Bad Old Days. 

Which makes it different from having negative beliefs about a hair color, or about a body height, or about a city of origin. Those are prejudices too, but on a different level from racism, without carrying the same ruinous threat of oppression. 

In many ways, minorities having collectively negatively statements about white people, is more similar to those, than to white racism. Even if they were technically fit the dictionary definition of ""racism"", using that as an excuse to bang on the dictionary, and expect people to be as terrified of it as of politicians courting the alt-right, is manipulative semantic trick to portray two vastly different situations under the same blanket.

"My point is moot just because you're interpreting it incorrectly. My point is that it's stupid and pointless to argue for zombies to be added to a battle pass that barely affects it in the least. Nothing about that has changed just because they could've done it better. 

I actually play zombies fairly regularly, I paid for the full game and I make sure to play every mode. I enjoy all 3 and I can still say that adding zombies progression to the current pass is an idiotic thought. The progression system and the way zombies is played wouldn't work together we'll, especially since you'd be spending unenjoyable amounts of time playing zombies to get even one rank. 

All of the modes in the game are worth 1/3 of the games price to me, the battle pass doesn't affect my idea of worth in any way, shape or form. I didn't pay for the pass, they offered free shit if I played specific modes, that doesn't devalue time spent in zombies, it just means they're focusing on the modes that have the highest population of people. If you truly view the battle pass as something that devalues your time, simply because you can't earn a very small set of cosmetics through it, then the problem lies in your mentality and not the game.

All I'm saying is that it's possible to get the job over the guy with more experience if you can show the employer that you deserve it more than they do — maybe you're hungrier, will work harder, have more ambition, have different experiences that make you unique, etc., etc. This isn't going to work every time but it certainly is possible. And that comes back to making yourself into the best employee possible, rather than searching for the best job possible. And being a better employee doesn't just come down to having more experience. It helps, but it's not the be all and end all. 

There will always be a laundry list of excuses as to why someone didn't get a particular job, but 9/10 it comes down to the person themselves — maybe you didn't show as much work ethic as the other candidate, maybe you weren't as personable, maybe you didn't have as much experience and failed to convince the employer as to why they should hire you anyways, and so on and so forth."

"> You literally said you are interested in the study because it aligns with your viewpoint, what you already find compelling. Do you deny it?

This is what you get for trying to be charitable..

I deny it thus:

I don't have any personal interest in the conclusion, beyond it supporting the ethical and philosophical arguments regarding religion that I have historically found most compelling. Intuitively it makes sense, but I know better to just jump on the first bit of data that seems to make sense to me.

What I'm clearly saying here is that the (tentative) conclusion makes sense to me, but obviously I'm not going to just slobber all over it for that reason. I read the source material. I read the criticisms. I understand the limitations of the study. My reasonable take-away from it is that it suggests something interesting and should be further researched (which as I said, is what is going to happen). If it turns out there's no correlation after all, I will happily accept that. I have nothing riding on it, it is simply something that is relevant to my interests. 

Compare that to how you interpreted what I said, and then ask yourself: which one of us is more guilty of jumping on that which appears to support our preconceived notions?

> What did you just say about finding ""compelling"" arguments that paint the religious in a bad light?

If you seriously, honestly think that the fact that I am more compelled by the ethical value of secular morality than I am by religious morality somehow means that I want to dislike religious people, then you need your head checked. That is an outrageous, ridiculous, embarrassing leap of logic. 

> It's actually been the default for ages. 

Because being religious has been the default for ages. Luckily (imho) that's changing, and more people are recognising the fact that religion isn't at all necessary for morality, and in fact in some cases may be detrimental.

Because he's the one that you are talking to. It is his death and Resurrection that allows you to have the relationship with God.

>Who is to define whether or not I'm actually ""in"" a relationship with God? 

God is the one who does that. What we can define is if you are adhering to the standards of behavior that he has revealed to us.

>I talk. He never answers. I ""pretend"" to say what I think he would say. Is that good enough? Because that's as close as anyone else has ever got.

I would disagree with this personally. There are a lot of people, (Myself included) who would say that God has spoken to them in a real meaningful way. 

In terms of the Bible, I think that even if you feel that he is not specifically speaking to you, that does not mean he is not. The moral atheist shows that even though he denies God, by being moral, he shows that he understands God's moral law. That the moral law is written in his heart.

Additionally, you are responsible for the truth you have. Picard said, ""The first duty of every [person] is to the truth, whether it's scientific truth or historical truth or personal truth! It is the guiding principle on which [a good life] is based! And if you can't find it within yourself to stand up and tell the truth about what happened, you don't deserve to [have the good life]!"" This is very much in accord with Romans 1 where God's anger is incurred by the suppression of the truth. Everything else flows from that. I can't tell you what truths you have, but I can tell you the truths I have.

"There are a few different private police forces in existencif that's what you want to know. They aren't in developed countries. There is some forces and roles privatised in developed countries for specific policing tasks. That model works because of oversight and transparency.

A 100% private police force has significant financial incentives to not be transparent and cover up misbehaviour. It also has financial incentives to misbehave (as do public ones). I.e. drug sales etc. 

The difference being that a private firm is hard to hold accountable, particularly when there isn't many different police firms to choose from (perfect competition). 

Then there is also an issue of the funding model and equity. Let's say I'm poor and I get robbed (the statistically most likely to be robbed), I report it, but I can't afford to pay for an investigation/work. 
Or alternatively, I do, but the person who robbed me has deeper pockets and can pay them to not investigate?
So the system becomes less equitable, and policing goes to who can afford it rather than who needs it.

 http  (this one means building a web server into your app) 
That's the only GUI capabilities it has. Unless you count popping up a toast or a simple pre-configured data-entry dialog window to be a qualifier (I sure don't). UiFacade is a pre-selection of dialogs. Nothing more.

 http  also indicates that there is no actual bindings to Android intents. So that cuts out your claim of ""interfacing with other android applications""...seeing as intents are the core method of inter-application interaction.

Now, as far as the rest of it, what good is ""managing"" sms data, phone, and sensor data...without a UI to display those things? Sure, you can display them in text, but the usefulness of text to display sensor data is pretty close to nil.

I know all of this, because I seriously, BADLY wanted to do something useful on Android with Python. I researched this shit for weeks. Beanshell has access to the Android API (and can create native interfaces), but it's basically a syntactic sugared Java and doesn't really rely on the SL4A backend like any of the other languages (especially python)

Methods can vary, but art and music tend to be the big attention grabbers since those are the two things people can see about a game immediately without needing to physically play it. Most of the RPG Maker games I've played myself are because I either saw official art or fanart on another site and I can say none of them completely used the standard assets. The only game that was recommended to me that used the generic tilesets and all that jazz was one my friend made for funsies back in high school.

Also, even big name brands release promo art and dedicate time and money to drawing in new consumers by appealing to them through design and advertising. Relying solely on brand loyalty will eventually lead to stagnation and possibly decline; especially if there's a big enough slip up that badly damages the brand's name.

So yes, you can blame him all you want. However I will not because I understand his reasoning behind a $5 tweak that does something simple. He put a lot of hard work into it, and deserves to set the price to whatever he deems necessary.

The original point, since you're interested in only contrarianism.

> I blame voters claiming the process is 'rigged' (like our current president did) when they really just don't understand civics.

The Democrats are a private institution. They do the same thing each and every year, and so does the GOP. If you register to vote, you are obligated to put forth your own effort to understand this. Since you obviously still haven't moved beyond the 2016 primaries, take this time to understand that the only way to get what you want is to demand it and become part of the system. That is civics. Bernie has already had tremendous success doing this and he did it even with frail support offered by people such as yourself. In the face of a Russian plant, you still want to split hairs over the DNC, just like the GOP wants. Get over yourself.

Edit, since you asked:

 > What is the standard I'm supposedly establishing?

That it's still worth pointing out that the Dems had the thumb on the scale for Hillary which invalidates all other context, especially in the face of a Russian plant with no standards at all.

"I'm not sure this explanation was warranted, as he was just saying he generally solos using the pentatonic scale. For instance, in D minor, he's using D F G A C. This is the basis for his solos, but he also finds that if he does add anything to this set, the added notes tend to be E and B, thus giving you D E F G A B C, or D dorian. If he were adding Bb instead of B natural, then he would be using a D minor scale. See how that works? 

That being said, his explanation of how he solos makes sense. You didn't actually give him any reasoning as to why you ""very much doubt [he was] playing either pentatonic or dorian"", though that's for the best because he probably was using those scales. 

As for this:
>I think you were adding one of the 2 extra notes from the diatonic scale to the pentatonic and calling that dorian, which you now know, it isn't.

-adding notes to the pentatonic scale absolutely gives you other scales, one of which is the dorian mode (add major 2nd and major 6th). To accentuate that, you'd want to make sure the harmony that you're playing over uses the same scale, thus giving you an available chord base of i-ii-III-IV-v-vi°-VII, though v is rarely used and would most likely be changed to V. I also agree with EveToWither that without harmonic context, none of it makes sense.

For the most part, your general idea was right, but practical usage wasn't there. I would encourage anyone who wants to learn about modes and scales to use any available online resources, because your explanation muddies the waters.

My response, naturally, which i consider to be totally reasonable...is that black people have on average 15 less iq than whites...they drop out of school far more often than whites...they commit crime more often than whites..they have children out of wedlock more often than whites...none of this is behavior is good for building wealth, and none if it is the fault of white people. Until black people overcome those issues that they have in their own community, we cannot expect that black people will not be underrepresented in any real meritocracy or in equal opportunity.

Naturally, to state these facts is enough to make many people actually assault me physically...and to drastically misconstrue the meaning of such statements. Many people seem to think that such facts imply that all black people are horrible...which is totally false. Any individual black person could be the most brilliant and civilized person in the nation...individuals imply little to nothing about averages.

The irony is that if the PC narrative were correct instead, then black people would have a much more logical reason to be violent. If you really are a victim of oppression, then why not revolt? that incites riots and creates people like micah johnson who killed totally innocent white people. So i really do not see a point in pandering to a person's narrative out of fear of violent backlash when their narrative in fact supports violence anyway.

One very strange thing about this example is that if I share my point of view with black people, they tend to be rather relaxed about it. The people who become most aggressive are white hipsters who seem to be on a mission to prove how not racist they are.

But at the end of the day, if we are not allowed to talk openly and logically about issues, I do not see how there is any chance to solve those issues. If we are going to assume that everything in the universe is caused by white racism...such as police killings (despite the fact that police are more likely to kill white people)...and try to solve these problems by crushing all of the unconscious racism that white people have..then the fact is we wont solve anything because those are NOT the real cause of the problem."

Attacks on my character, starts going through my posts

Here are the statistics, that prove my point.

I think they are, my culture is different, lets agree to disagree.

Ok now I see why we should not have abortion, nuts like you. You have obviously had one or more abortions and feel guilt over it. I reluctantly thought it wasn't as bad but now I see it is.

name calling, says I was never pro choice despite me showing a recent post that I was and having no proof of it,

try harder

What are you even trying to do? You have enough cognitive dissonance to ignore proof, statistics and evidence, you are posting about kindness to others, yet you are obviously on a crusade that is materializing itself into attacks on me. You posted about being kind to others, and have not been kind at all. You post so much about not being abusive, yet you are following me into other threads, picking fights and spend a lot of time writing nonsense, and posting links for others to read about stopping abuse, yet you are abusive towards me, and constantly making remarks that you cannot substantiate (like claiming I was never pro choice).

You may go to therapy, but its obviously not working. You may read these articles on kindness, yet you don't listen. Its mental masturbation, like Donald Trump having books he never reads. You may even read them, but you don't ever act like they say. I said things I regret, your character is the exact opposite of the kind that convinces people that you are right. 

I implore you, to look inside and ask yourself what kind of mentally healthy person would go on such tirades and continue to love an abusive ex while wasting their time on arguing semantics, losing an argument, then convincing me that I should be against it? I know you feel guilt about your abortion, but that is no reason for you to make such ridiculous claims, and the truth is that you think by convincing me that you would have felt better and justified in your abortion. But we know that isn't true.

Learn to love yourself instead of hating others, especially if they are successful at the things you are attacking them at. Get off of reddit, and use the time with your child instead of arguing with strangers. Instead of posting meaningless feel good articles, ignoring their advice and reading more, heal yourself.

">I don't provide solutions for things which are not problems. I don't see the current system as a problem.


But many more people do find required mods taking up space a problem; its one of the most talked about aspects of how damage should change in damage 3.0. 


>But you're moving the goalposts around anyway, since all I was talking about to begin with was enemies requiring more skill - you dove off the deep end about mods, when the situations are only tangentially related at best.


You are just lying at this point, as you replied to my comment where I was talking about required mods in the first place (meaning I couldn't have moved goal posts if that was where they initially were), and I, not you, brought up the possibility of making higher-level content scale with harder (in terms of skill) enemies instead of exponentially increasing armor/health/damage values. I didn't dive off the deep end about mods; that was what I was talking about initially when you replied to me. And you didn't even bring up skill-based enemies, I did. Please stop lying and reread the comment chain.


>I stand behind my previous statements. Mods aren't an issue, aren't directly related to enemies that take more skill, and a solution to the skill based enemies doesn't in any way have to involve the mod system.


Many more people believe that mandatory mods are a negative, as they take away from player choice and drain your points; we may as well have 6 slots for primaries and 5 for secondaries. 


Like I've said before (please try to listen this time), when people talk about damage 3.0 and what changes they would like to see, it encompasses more than one issue. So, it encompasses mandatory mods, enemy scaling, and skill based gameplay. It is not only one issue. 


And your constant comments about how the issues are unrelated and tangential is silly, as mods was the original point I was talking about, and the point that you replied to.


>We're at an impasse. You won't change my view with your argument, we fundamentally disagree.

I'd really have preferred if this reply was replying to that comment, for reasons that will become apparent, but it's too late for that.

>The only real difference is he has 2 less Dex and +4 Wis, +1 Int and Str.

No; there are two differences that came to light since then. The first is that where these stat blocks came from are explained to the OP who stated that he just googled stats and used them. The stats I recommended come from a 25 point buy and I linked the calculator and told him to play with the calculator.

The second is that they're more realistic for a character to actually possess, and easier to roleplay. Having 3 dump stats is a pain in the ass to RP and it's obvious cheese most GMs don't want to put up with. It's an unrelated note to the class nerf. 

The only implied connection is that power gammers gonna get nerfed is a very common thing, but the OP suggested that he isn't a power gamer when he said he googled how to witch.

>Most characters choose 1 or 2 aspects that they are good in, depending on how many good stats they have. 

Yeah, I said that. But they don't choose one or two things to get good at, at the exclusion of everything else. That's munchkin territory (an extreme form of power gaming).

>But what he is saying is basically akin to telling [class x nerf y].

I also suggested not playing a class you know is going to get its tits nerfed off. Especially if nerfs bother you. If playing a nerfed character is going to piss a person off the easiest solution is not to play it. I gave an alternate solution in the form of Unlettered Arcanist who has the witch's spell list (and patron familiar) but still can get a few powerful wizard/sorcerer arcane spells (from having a school) not found on the witch's spell list.

I also advised against a new player playing a full prepared spell casting class since that's a bitch even for veterans. 

If you had really thoroughly read the post you were responding to then I wouldn't have to re-explain every single point to you, and you might have actually contributed to the conversation. But, everything you said has already been said before by others, and everything you made me say in response is something I've already said before.

"Right, so as an actual British person who has studied modern British history, I can give you an actual answer that isn't from Americans talking about America and WW2. 

Following WW2, the two main parties, Labour and the Conservatives, agreed on major policies in a consensus known as Butskellism, named after the Conservative Rab Butler and the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell. 

This consensus basically followed the economic theory of Keynesianism which is that idea that the aim of the state should be to keep unemployment as low as possible and the best way to run the economy was to borrow to invest. Part of this theory was substantial high taxes on the wealthy which also helped pay for Britain's extensive welfare state and the sluggish economic situation at the time. 

This consensus lasted until 1979 when Margaret Thatcher came to power and established a new consensus following monetarist policies. This is similar to ""Reaganomics"" in America. She, and Reagan, believed that individuals spent their money better than the government and so reduced taxes. She reduced the top rate of tax from around 83% to 40% in her first term and it's been like that ever since. 

As to your question of ""was it sustainable?"", well yes, taxation like that lasted for 30 years and probably would've gone on for longer of Thatcher's economic policies hadn't become dominant in the UK"

"> We’ve been doing that for months in regards to ToB.
> We’re not asking for huge engine overhauls or features that CA have never implemented. The vast majority of criticism has been about CA removing features that were already in previous games. How is it unrealistic to want them to, you know... not remove something they’ve used in the past? At this point I’ve given up wanting CA to put in cool new features because I know they won’t, so really all I want is for them to just not get rid of things that worked in the past, but even that is a lost cause now.

Not really. In previous months, if you look at certain opinions, there's a disparity in player reception.

For instance, players clamored for an explanation why ambushes were being removed; u/Jack_CA eventually gave an answer after arriving at the office (as he had promised).

In the official TW forums, the reception was understanding - players understood the reason for removing the feature, and were moving forward.

When Jack explained it here on Reddit, the reception was a bit more critical - players did not understand why it had to happen; they kept asking 'why' (even though that was already answered). Some insisted that 'it should be easy to make these changes'; some espoused the slippery-slope argument such as 'what if CA streamlined all features so we only have 1 building and 1 unit in future games'.

Others in a knee-jerk reaction felt that this was a betrayal of the community, or that Thrones was already the worst game in the franchise. And finally, a couple of people decided to call for boycotts because these were 'dark times for the TW franchise'.

So yes - people here wanted an answer, they got one, they were angry because they didn't like it.

-----------

In the old days (cough - 90's, early-2000's, pre-social media/streaming/blogs) - we used to criticize games after we had experienced them, or and we often took critic opinions with a grain of salt. Today, we criticize games after we hear about them from someone else, almost espousing the ideas presented by certain critics - who are, more often than not, fellow gamers like us.

In effect, this leads people to believe that 'removing features in order to focus on new ones' is a bad thing - even though the Saga-series is considered an 'experimental one to look into other areas that TW can delve into'.

Here's a more detailed explanation on how our criticism of games has changed over the years.

And here's another one about how opinions/critique has changed based on the landscape of the media/social platforms nowadays.

-------

> Yep, and that’s why they’re paid to work as game developers and programmers and not fast food employees. You seriously can’t keep dismissing every criticism or suggestion with “well you can’t do it so give them a break” or “well it’s hard, don’t expect too much”. 


And it's also not an idea of - 'hey it's hard, don't expect too much' - it's a case of 'it's hard, so set your expectations properly'. There's a key difference there.

The moment the average gamer feels that certain steps are easy to do, even though they are not - whether it's due to the game's engine, or programming issues, or the game's overall direction - the average gamer then sets more unrealistic expectations layered on top of the other.

Take a look at Destiny for instance. Gamers initially wanted improvements to the system because the sequel was disappointing; next thing you know, people wanted Destiny 1 to come back. If the developer tries to go back to that system, people then ask 'why it's taking so long', or 'why did they even try to change in the first place'.

In essence - it does not lead to anything constructive because people are still stuck dwelling on the past ('why did these things happen?') rather than providing -realistic and level-headed- feedback that allows the game to move forward.

Here's a topic about how to provide constructive criticism for developers as written by an independent developer. Notice how it also points out how we should assume certain changes are difficult, and that we should not get stuck thinking of the 'why' (things happened).

"No, their is no reasonable way that April 26 + ""about three weeks"" + ""two months"" = before early July. The clear reference to WikiLeaks only further clarifies that, the FBI opening their investigation in response in late July only clarifies it further still.

For an example, just look at the treatment of the WSJ depending on whether they provide info users want to hear (voted to the top) and info they don't (Murdoch propaganda rag).

Edit: and to clarify an earlier point, my issue with the NYT article is that, no matter how you interpret the timeline, both Steele and Australia contacted the FBI prior to their decision to investigate. The articles reasoning, that the FBI's decision was based on the Aussie info and not Steele's is not supported with any evidence. Likely, the Aussie info corroborated Steele's earlier claims, and in combination, it was therefore deemed credible enough to warrant investigation."
"How about your start by watching more games rather than becoming a ""die hard"" fan. It shouldn't be a something you DECIDE TO become, it should be natural. Otherwise it's just plain stupid to be honest.

"I'll try to summarize your main issues:

1. The use of two terms which are likely worldviews of many r/atheists. Not sure why you're still so caught up on these, as they're simply frameworks from which to understand what it is possible to know and how we arrive at such knowledge which leave no room for a deity. 

2. You still seem resolved to defend the position that the scientific method is completely separate from philosophy. 

3. Atheists don't require a belief in any sort of metaphysics.

Responses:

1. I'm not going to type out summaries again. Positivism. Naive Empiricism.

2. Philosophy is involved both the formulation of the scientific method itself and the interpretation of data. Empirical data alone is useless, it must be analyzed within some framework (the method) and interpreted in order to be of any use. 

The method itself cannot be designed by science. Philosophers are behind the details of the scientific method. If you choose to deny this, please give your explanation of how we arrived at the method. This is essentially the same question which you dodged earlier, i.e. name a scientific result which is separate from all philosophy. 

The interpretation of results is crucial to science itself. For any set of physical data there is literally an infinite number of mathematical models which will fit the data to any desired precision. The very idea of an ""electron"" is an interpretation. This concept is useful for asking further questions, but it is an abstraction from the data. 

If we wanted to, we could still use the epicyclic, geocentric model of the solar system to describe retrograde motion. There is no predictive difference between Kepler's heliocentric, elliptical model of the solar system and a sufficiently tuned version Ptolemy's geocentric model. If we work out the details of the epicycles and such with enough precision, the model can be used for identical predictions to that of Kepler and Newton. So why do we choose the heliocentric model? Occam's razor is philosophical in nature.

Beyond the fact that data is useless without some interpretation, in many cases the interpretation suggests new models or experiments. Einstein was convinced that some sort of deterministic hidden variables were behind the randomness of quantum mechanics. A guy by the name of John Bell devised some experiments to test whether or not hidden variables were even possible. This is some pretty far out science, and at this point, philosophical interpretation is pretty much the only guide for forming new hypotheses. 

General Relativity was inspired by Mach's principle. It makes statements about equivalences of differing states which are central to physics, but at the time were nowhere to be found within theory or data.

If you're still somehow convinced that science lives in a vacuum, I can't help you.

3. <---(this is a 3, I do not understand reddit's formatting) I never said that atheists need to believe in a metaphysics. One member of the Vienna circle wrote a paper entitled ""The Elimination of Metaphysics through the Logical Analysis of Language"", part of the reason I mentioned the circle. 

That said, atheists do have to maintain some sort of worldview (unless one is a nihilist), which is the reason I provided two example frameworks. Not as authoritative statements, but to illustrate that pretty much every worldview is a positive assertion of the manner in which things work. There are plenty of worldviews out there that do not leave room for a deity or religion or a whole host of other things. Unless you're a nihilist, though, there is some form of the world which you prefer to believe in. I say ""believe in"", as up to this point in science/philosophy/humanity there is no way of telling which view is correct (or even if a correct view exists).



The only question I have for you is this:

Why are you so steadfastly holding to the positions that atheism isn't a belief and that science is separate from philosophy?

As to the former question, I have no idea why so many atheists get so touchy when their system is labeled a 'belief'. Is there some shame if one isn't on the side of airtight ""real truth""? Hopefully not, as ""real truth"" doesn't exist as far as the best and brightest of our species can tell.

As to the latter, have you actually practiced any science? Studied any philosophy? If not, there's no problem with that, but if you have done any of it, I can't imagine you holding the position that science somehow lives in a neat little vacuum of perfect knowledge.

You can't ignore the majority of the playerbase just so that the game is more balanced at a competitive level. That's how you lose players and money. Even Hearthstone has this straight.

Oh my goodness. I don't even know how to begin to respond to this. Not even taking into account that this is a complete non-sequitur no-scotsman trash argument....

First, please establish that the balance changes were ACTUALLY due to overpoweredness at lower levels of play and not just what people THOUGHT were overpowered. Your argument holds no water unless you can do this.

Now if you want to go down the ""but it feels bad to play against"" argument then you might as well make everyone just play 7 cost vanilla bronzes every single turn. Because it's not the card that feels bad, it's losing that feels bad. Going off your ""example"" of hearthstone balance, if the devs nerfed everything that ""felt bad"", they would have nerfed:

 Wild Growth
 Mech Mage
 Secret Paladin
 Dr. Boom
 Face Hunter
 Control Warrior
 Crystal Rogue

While this is a wrong assessment...your comment amounts to this. ""It's okay if he does not succeed out of the gate""

>We drafted him knowing he was gonna be a project and that he needed work.

Who is we? And how do you know this? Is it because every expert labeled him raw. I love this argument because there is no proof behind it. 

>I don't even think you can accurately say he's regressed when you consider that Marrone and Hackett basically forced him to play scared of making any mistakes.

Forced him to play scared. Explain what this means because your football IQ is much higher than mine. Dumb it down for me. They forced him to throw the ball no where near our WRs? They forced Manuel to hold onto the ball too long? They forced Manuel to not be able to read a defense pre snap? 

Interesting assessment there. 

>Sure he has weaknesses but making a 2nd year player afraid of making any mistakes isn't really the best way to make him improve.

Please tell us the recipe to make a good QB. The answer is there is no single recipe. QBs who start from Day 1 are no more successful than QBs that start later on (drafted in the same area). 

Your excuses revolve around a way of thinking that does not include facts. For instance:

1.) ""Experts called him raw, so he needs X amount of years before we can determine if he is good"" 

2.) ""He has not regressed, actually I will just avoid this point and blame it on the coaches""

3.) ""He plays scared because the coaches made him play that way""

4.) ""You shouldn't make a QB play scared, they won't develop. Joe Flacco played in a very conservative scheme, but If I mention his name it would ruin my argument""

"I can tell you have not the slightest idea of how film works. You throw in cinematography and pacing in your review but in reality, if you knew what pacing was then there was no way, in hell, you would agree the pacing was great. And when you say the cinematographer was a bit mixed, can you elaborate. And the tension? I saw better tension when officer hops (or whatever the fuck that bunnys name was) had more tension when she actually became a cop and was in the bullpen with the other officers. And also when you said it was a decent action flick and if you review it otherwise as anything else, you are either ignorant? Really, because if you knew film structure, you would understand how the action and the pacing work perfectly together. I suggest you watch die hard or the first few lethal weapons buddy.

Also, the script is not decent when you have to use more exposition than you need. You know what exposition is right? For example, when they all get in the cop SUV in the beginning to escape, ward tells him to roll up the windows because it's bullet proof. Then the gang members started shooting at them and he said, once again, that they were bullet proof. That's a perfect example of too much exposition because either the writer does not know how to write correctly or he thinks the audience are fucking idiots. I'm guessing it's the idiots because you said this was a decent action flick (transformers anyone?). True dialogue is minimal where the audience picks up the rest. It engages the audience to become more immersive. Example, I would have had will smith say, ""roll up the windows now!"" Then while they drive away they shoot at the car. The gang members get close on the side and point a gun right at toms face and tom looks scared as shit. They pull the trigger. The glass doesn't break but shatters in a spider like web. Tom jumps and the car runs into the side of another car cause sparks and chaos (perhaps) hitting some trashcans on the way. Tom, and the audience realize that it's bullet proof. Tom, sadistically smiles and floors it and now a car battle ensues with Tom ramming into the side of the other car. We know now that he's a little bit safer with the bullet proof glass so now he's willing to up the ante to ensure his and the rests survivability. The car ramming keeps going until the gangmembers car runs into a steel pipe,faucet, car, whatever. Game over.

What about any of the above demonstrates an attitude, and what ""attitude"" is that? Absolutely nothing, as far as I can see. If your problem is that I am being oppositional to your viewpoint, well...welcome to a debate forum. It isn't called /r/BeAgreeableWithAChristian. I didn't use an ad hominem argument, I didn't personally attack you, and I didn't threaten you. I laid out my argument logically and civilly. Your complaints about my ""attitude"" are nothing but a whine. Stop whining. 

>The reason the robot analogy is so weak is because it presents a scenario where the 'created' and the 'creator' are too similar.

No, they're not. It isn't even necessary for them to share any qualities. As long as the created object possesses the traits I outlined, It cannot be moral to justify destruction solely on a whim using creation as a standard. That is why the robot analogy is the correct one. 

>A more accurate scale to Christianity, (or even to OP's premises), would be... 'as a grain of sand is to the Milky Way, so humans are to God'. 

Now you're making a host of category errors. The difference between humans and a grain of sand is that we think, feel, and make value judgements. As long as that is true, humans are moral beings. This is why the robot analogy applies, while the leukemia cure and sand analogies break down at this level. All your argument amounts to is the statement that ""God is such a greater moral being than us that we can't judge his morality."" If that is true, and we have no reference by which to judge God's morality, then you can't determine if he is good or bad. Calling your god ""good"" or ""bad"" is inherently a moral judgment, which, as you've argued, you cannot make about him because of your own limited moral understanding. Thus, your argument has pulled the rug out from under your own feet, and you can no longer say ""God is good.""

Once you lose the ground to argue that ""God is good,"" how do you claim that your god is worthy of worship, if he exists?

> If we accept the basic philosophical definition of God as 'a being such that no greater being can possibly be conceived of'

This is a completely untenable definition. It simply doesn't work.

1) Define ""greater."" The word is meaningless outside of a defined context of measurement. One is greater than negative two in value, but negative two is greater than one in magnitude. What is the essence of the greatness you're talking about? Is it size? Power? ""Goodness""? The word ""greatest"" doesn't mean anything on its own, it is a modifier that must be qualified by a context. Your ""greatness"" is an undefined concept, and so all you've done is try to define your god into unfalsifiability by retreating behind another vague term. 

2) Once you define ""greatness,"" your definition will inherently lead to an infinite regress. Any standard of greatness can be incrementally increased. As such, any proposed ""greatest"" example can simply be incremented again, using the same standard of greatness. This is the philosophical underpinning of the concept of infinity. Our conceptions are unlimited in this regard, so positing God as the upper limit here is nonsensical. There is always a greater infinity that can be conceived of.

3) The Christian god is already defined, and your definition does not comport to the preexisting one. The Christian god is defined by his attributes and actions as outlined in the Bible. That god which is outlined in the Bible is certainly not the greatest being that I can imagine, so your definition forces us to reject the god of the Bible.

4) Even if you can prove that your definition isn't nonsensical, you would still have to demonstrate that the greatest being of which we can conceive actually exists in order to refer to his moral integrity in any kind of sensible way.

>You've referred to humans as 'lesser moral beings', and God as a 'greater moral being'. This is exactly the same error that I made in the robot analogy by referring to the robot maker's actions as moral. It seems that you have already pre-judged the moral integrity of God as well. 

This appears to be an admission that it is impossible to judge the morality of God's actions as either good or bad. 

Humans are moral beings because they think, feel, and make value judgments. This inherently creates a moral framework in which we live. Does God think, feel, and make value judgments? The Bible indicates he does, so he would have to be a moral being. You yourself have gone on about how God is the ""greatest being that can be conceived of."" This definition cannot result in any conclusion other than God is a greater moral being than humans. 

Regardless, this point doesn't knock down or answer the question at hand: If humans lack the ability to judge God's moral integrity, then how can you say that your god is good?

>From your comments up to this point, I have gotten the impression that your beliefs are just the opposite of that. Please try to retain some level of consistency.

Of course my beliefs are not the same as yours. That's why I'm arguing against your beliefs. In some instances, I am arguing from within your framework to demonstrate that it is logically inconsistent. This exercise is not inconsistent. I do not have to surrender my framework to argue from within yours. This is a classic philosophical gambit which can be easily used to demonstrate that a position is untenable. 

The fact that I am using multiple angles of attack, both from within your framework and from outside it, does not mean that I am being inconsistent. 

>does the grain of sand have the capacity to understand the moral integrity of the Milky Way galaxy? Then - on what basis does the grain of sand judge it's own moral integrity?

These questions are utter nonsense. Sand doesn't make value judgments. The Milky Way doesn't make value judgments. Humans do. The Christian conception of God is that he makes value judgments. Otherwise, he would have no way of decreeing any action as right or wrong. 

If I accept your analogy, then you are the grain of sand. On what basis do you claim that God is good? If you do not claim that God is good, then why is he worthy of worship?"
"I was considering a rebuttal but its just not worth it. While I disagree with pretty much all of your logic you consistently straw man my arguments to the extent that its not worth bothering continuing with this.

I want all businesses to be able to deduct capital expenses, but in a fair method for the entire market. You believe that the Oil and Gas Percentage Deferment is equivalent to that in other industries, I disagree and can likewise site sources indicating this. But maybe the Oil industry as a whole is somehow more risky than it appears on paper. It consistently has a great bottom line and significant profits but maybe they need all of these tax-advantages to stay afloat. However the tax-advantages are very expensive to Joe Taxpayer and the industry is very profitable in part due to these tax-advantages so maybe the industry could just be profitable. "

No, it's really really not.

let me be perfectly fucking clear about this, because apparently there are people in my government who think like you, and it has led to some of the most despicable acts of our generation. 

Torture is fucking evil. It is not justified, excepting situations where it is guaranteed to be effective at preventing a catastrophy of enormous proportions (atomic war, pandemic, or other extinction event.)

Dany's situation didn't even come CLOSE to justifying the torture of YOUNG GIRLS, just to inflict psychological damage on their father to get him to talk, because he MIGHT know SOMETHING about a few resistance freedom fighters who were killing ARMED MILITARY POLICE of an invading occupational force. 

That act is Evil. Period. 

To suggest otherwise is to put yourself on a level equal to the Masters you applaud her for betraying, deposing, and murdering.

I'll summarize for you.

1. By definition reflexes do not require expectation, as you have explained. But they do require perception. Good thing there's a skill for that.

2. ""It's a game"" has never and will never amount to any sort of valid response about mechanics.

3. Vanish is negated by acting in a hostile manner, and is rendered worthless by verbal components.

4. At the very worst, the always unoptimized blaster caster will do roughly 50% more damage than usual once. And only under very specific circumstances. Boo hoo.

5. Perception checks allow for players to get a reflex save even in the worst of circumstances on the player's end.

6. The players can, and likely will abuse this ruling far more than any npcs will.

Literally the only thing this rule adds is a perception check, and as I've explained multiple times, the perception check is not easy to get around on the opponent's end. And even if they do manage to work around it, the benefits are so negligible that there's essentially no reason to complain.

Define the terms, then prove it.

> The sequence of motion cannot extend ad infinitum.

Prove it

> this everyone understands to be God

1) Prove that 'everyone' understands that to be the case

2) The argument is self contradictory. It talks about us observing actual motion. It says that actual motion must be caused by actual motion (with, possibly, potential motion as an intermediary). So therefore this first mover must have actual motion. But you also said ""nothing can move itself""... in which case something else must have moved the first mover. Your own argument makes a first mover impossible.

The second argument is just as flawed.

my issue with Watch Dogs was that it tried so much and excelled in literally nothing. i've seen prettier, busier, more fun open worlds before, i've played far more satisfying shooters before, i've played driving games that feel so much better, and i've played stealth games with way more complexity and depth before. it's one of those games where instead of offering a singular, engrossing experience, it just says ""fuck it, you can do everything"", without making any of those things actually feel good. where Rockstar excels is the amount of time and detail they pour into everything; the shooting feels great, the stories are well told, the world is always perfection, even the driving feels better than 50% of the driving games available now. you can not only do everything but actually want to do everything because everything is so fun. when they offer you a driving mission ""fuck yeah, sounds baller"", or when it's a heist ""shit yeah i love shooting shit this feels like Heat"", and i think that's where most of their copycats fail. i never wanted to spend more than 5 minutes driving in Watch Dogs, and i definitely didn't want to spend more than 5 minutes shooting things or throwing distractions around and waiting for guards to mosey on over to the corner and let me pass.

">The underlying presumption is that the State just sort of waved its hands and hundreds of years of structural oppression just sort of vanished...... a notion that grants the State an almost godlike control over the beliefs and actions of everyone.

Not what I was saying at all. Racism did not just disappear, you are correct. I think the state already did the only thing it can do by passing the Civil Rights Act. Everything else since then that is government sanctioned to promote diversity is counterproductive, however. Whereas you think the State can be used to solve the issue to some extent, I think the State has absolutely no role. Your examples only go to further my argument. That study that employers discriminate against people with minority-sounding names, exists in a society where the government supposedly promotes diversity. 

>Race does still matter. In fact, in your other post you don't look at the governance of this country in terms of what people believe politically, religiously, or culturally. You look at solely in racial terms as if ""mostly white"" means that there a uniform portion of the population that is going to vote exactly the same way.

Not what I meant, you notice in that post I mention the author should use basic statistics. The fact is in a country that is 80% white, the majority of any pool of people, regardless of role, is going to be white. I am criticizing the author for stating the obvious as if it is a bad thing. It's statements like that that only serve to further divide the country.

>Which cannot be done if the Right fundamentally opposes any effort to combat racism as ""white discrimination"".

There is no such thing as ""white discrimination"" or ""reverse discrimination"". Simply put it is discrimination. And some government policies do discriminate against white folks. Those aren't the only policies I am opposed to however. I am opposed to all policy involving race other than the Civil Rights Acts and related Constitutional Amendments. As I said before regardless of the purpose, by making race a factor in order to ""make up"" for past historical events is a fruitless and in this case divisive solution. I maintain the only way to get people to stop looking at color as a factor is to lead by example. The government still promotes racism through its current policies and it is wrong.

>There is something ""special"" about them: they are underrepresented... You cannot blame the government for forcing companies to hire minorities for the lack of minorities that are present in companies

Actually I can. And I will. It's promoting racism in the establishment, maintaining that somehow race is a factor when it comes to employment. The government is sending the message to employers and the people that ""underrepresented minorities"" are somehow inherently inferior to everyone else and need special treatment in order to be competitive. That's not the intention, but that is the underlying psychological message.

>I am a Mexican.

Congrats? You want a medal? We all are something. I am Colombian and German. You can't imagine how much crap I got as a kid with that combo. Everyone is something. People are going to be shitheads no matter where you are at. Europe is portrayed as this Nirvana of racial purity, yet they are some of the most racist folks in the planet. Get a little bit of diversity in their countries and things fall apart rapidly. Just look at what happened in Yugoslavia. Things may seem bad here in the US, but compared to most parts of the world, we are relatively stable despite our diversity. 

>like the vast majority of people belong to minorities out there

Again, you have this notion that there is this huge group of support that is a super majority in this country, typical mentality of someone who hasn't really traveled and seen the country. 80% of the country is white. Assuming every single latino is white, 65% of the country is non-hispanic and white. There isn't this huge block of undiscovered minorities out there that somehow make minorities a majority. Being a minority mean, you are in the minority. It sucks. I know. I've been there. I also totally understand racism and the feeling of overwhelming anger and helplessness it makes you feel.

Not only that but racing on back roads presents some issues itself. For instance, if you crash, you're much less likely to get help in a timely manner than on a main street, and certainly less likely than on a track.

On back roads, you're not expecting the family that's out of a hike in a secluded area and they're not expecting you. So on the off chance that you do come across other people, it's more dangerous because everyone is caught off guard.

There's more but I'm at work.

Good job, you discovered what ""can"" means!

Next up, no, responsibility is relevant because I brought it up. I mentioned my opinion and you're trying to play psychologist and trip me up to ""reveal"" I believe abortion is taking a life.

I've said that numerous times during this entire thread. However, I also noted that abortion, to me at least, seems like a lazy way out of a dilemma. You're faced with a child-- which you KNEW was a possibility engaging in sexual intercourse-- and taking a life-- which, when a mother is killed and her baby is in utero, is fully acknowledged as a homo sapien^1. Abortion seems like the ""easiest"" way out-- and I assure you, people don't receive abortions because they're harder. To clear up a misconception before it's said: I feel sympathy for those who've received abortions (at least those who feel guilty, not those who get an abortion upon seeing every positive pregnancy test). They must live with a lot of regret, never getting to see their child's face. There's always a better way.

In the end, it's a matter of responsibility to me, coupled with the taking of life. I'm also disgusted by the abortion methods themselves. Suction and curetage, prostaglandin, and the others... just disgusting.

Just again, for a wrap up:

Why I see it as a responsibility problem:

> native HDR and FP16 are new for nvidia. just because another company implemented it first doesn't mean it costs less to implement -- AMD has always been ahead on adding these new technologies.

It's not new to Nvidia. Their workstation card had them for a while. Pascal also had native FP16, it wasn't just great at doing it. For the price point of view, I don't remember AMD jumping up with launch price when they had those implemented in their card. It's all part of the dev cost, and it's not adding significant manufacturing cost when they are baking it into the wafer, so where is the cost justification for that?

> what did we get with pascal, SMP that hardly anything uses, hardware-level DX12/vulkan support and i think that was about it. maxwell i don't remember anything really significant either.

You do realize that the raytracing needs DX12 support, right? So if RT is a 'big' technology, then why underestimate DX12 support? Nvidia didn't invent ray tracing, nor DX12, they built their RTX on top of what's already been done with dedicated ASIC core to run it faster. Of course they spent millions to make this happen, but it shouldn't attributed to the cost justification. 

Look, i'm not trying to bash the people who buys these card. If anything, i blame NV for their clever marketing and price gouging with this opportunistic time. If anything, this reminds me of the time when they announced Titan Z with their fuck-you price of $3,000.

"I don't think you understand how football transfers work at all. Or how buying anything works.

1. They don't have to. But clubs keep them private out of respect for each other, so as not to disrupt a player, piss off the fans, annoy the manager, affect share price etc etc.

2. No company, when spending tens of millions of pounds, will accept the first offer. There is always negotiation, there always has been and there always will be.

3. If he wants to show that he ""isn't fucking around"" then he should send Arsenal's MD or Chairman a letter, fax, or email simply stating that he absolutely will not accept any bid of less than £XXm, and that he will not entertain any future bids under that amount.

No one has ever done this.

If you call someone out for looking at your chest publicly, they may have defensively said that you tempted them to look by dressing that way, but I refuse to believe you're stupid enough to sincerely mistake one for the other. That said, this connects to my previous post with respect to 'expectations of private permissions to apply in a public space' which you also have failed to grasped, so maybe I'm expecting too much here.

This is 100% humour for people in one specific culture. It's pretty easy to understand why someone outside of the typical American/UK culture to take offense to the joke. I wouldn't necessarily call all of those people ""SJWs"" (as if that's always a bad thing).

I found it mildly funny, but I personally didn't take offense to it. But I sure could understand why someone would.

"I'm not interested in a semantics debate. Just please understand that ""liberal"" typically means either ""laisse-faire"" (Europe) or ""social democrat"" (America) or pro-market centrist (neo-liberalism all over the place). If you just associate it with the ""American"" type of liberalism, then you risk obscuring what people outside of America mean by it, or what economists and philosophers tend to mean by it. The people in r/socialism, for all their faults, reject both 'liberal' in the European sense as well as 'liberal' in the American sense, because they don't think these ideas go far enough.

When you say

>You mean like demonstrating that free markets are not inherently efficient? Or that morally, capitalism and unfettered inequity are not morally correct? Or that the government ought to take control of industries to protect labor from exploitation? Or that the people should have a direct hand in their government, thus making the foregoing ""control"" directly accountable and managed by ""the people?""

It sounds naive because for the most part, philosophers and economists describing themselves as ""liberal"" have argued in favor of ""free markets"", against ""government control of industry"", and against making 'government' ""directly accountable and managed by ""the people"". 

Debate over these questions is a typical debate between a ""liberal"" and a ""socialist"". Someone like Piketty would probably describe himself as an opponent of liberalism, because in his homeland in France, liberalism is either associated with lassie-faire free-markets, or with the neo-liberalism associated with corporatist mercantilism. While American journalists may associate Piketty's ideas with ""liberalism"", that is not the case in American universities, where ""liberalism"" in the academic context is more likely to mean endorsing ""laisse faire"" than ""interventionist"". Here we detect some of the discourse-damaging effects of the (Orwellian) consolidation of media ownership worldwide. But fortunately the Internet has the potential to break this consolidation.

It's true that the ideas of people like Rawls can easily be interpreted as supporting socialist ideas, but there's always going to be a connection between the philosophical ideas associated with liberalism and the philosophical ideas associated with libertarian socialism and socialism (given that they are related and all find their roots in Enlightenment thinking). But that doesn't mean it's not useful to draw a distinction between ""liberalism"" and ""socialism"" based on an empirical understanding of the kinds of ideas that are typically promoted under each label."

"> A game focused and balanced around a mode and a competitive scene, where players are not playing that mode can't really sustain itself.

It can easily sustain itself, after all those players are still buying gems, this is exactly what Smite has been doing for the past 6~7 years.

> and balancing problems where some gods are very good at pubstomping

Most pubstompers gods are also pubstompers at Conquest, the fact that players choose others mode has nothing to do with it.

> without a single mention of Conquest.

I could be wrong because I did the tutorials a long time ago, but I'm almost sure that there was a Conquest tutorial.

> because if they do touch Conquest eventually they will be bombarded with smurfs, which is a consequence of this problem in the first place.

Smurfs have nothing to do with players playing the other modes, it is a totally different problem. Even if the only game mode was Conquest we would probally still have the same amount of smurfs and the problem would still be the same.

> which brings me to my main point:

> To counteract the problems outlined here, there should be Conquest related events similar to the adventures, or to Divine Uprising. Events that promote players to play Conquest and learn the different roles and strategies. Offer points for completing quests and playing (and winning at) Conquest and Ranked Conquest, that you can use for things such as skins or chests. A single day with the quest ""Kill the gold fury before 15 minutes"" for everyone will teach more about objective control than a year of playing Joust, for example. Even if it wouldn't completely solve the problem, it would definitely diminish it.

I'll be honest here, how much time have you been playing Smite? 1 and a half year? Maybe less?

Hi-Rez used to do Conquest based quests during the Odyssey, with quests like ""Kill the Fire Giant as a team"", ""Kill the Gold Fury as a team"" or ""Win X games of Conquest"".

Do you want to know why they stopped doing those? Because no one liked them. Non Conquest players hated them because they were forced to play a game mode they didn't want to play while Conquest players hated them because they received lots of players that didn't know wtf they were doing in their games.

Also, no, a quests like ""Kill the gold fury before 15 minutes"" wouldn't teach anything about objective control. It would happen just like in Odyssey 2017 were lots of non Conquest players would just rush the GF as soon as it spawned, usually they were able to do it and then they would or lose it because the enemy team took their towers down while they were with 5 players killing the GF or they would just surrender at 10 because they already did their quest.

Your idea wouldn't diminish the problem, it would just bring a old problem back."
"I've poked my head in here since it became a default sub and have admittedly fallen into the 'defensive male' category a few times. Most of my friends are women, and we do discuss gender from time to time. The difference between those conversations and the internet in general is, even though we debate, agree, disagree, neither of us is making the other feel guilty by association. We're actually exploring a topic and learning. I realize that to many I'm probably just a privileged white male whose life is all sunshine and lollipops, but, for example, I cross the street and take a longer route home if I'm walking behind a lone woman late at night. I feel absolutely horrible that I've done nothing but I'm still seen as threatening and am scaring someone. But I also understand why. That's where some of the defense is coming from. The internet is a far safer forum to be able to speak; I'm sure not going to yell 'HEY! I'M NOT THREATENING!' at 2am to some other person trying to get home herself.

"Yeah, late, blah blah; whatever. 

While I get what your issue is, in this instance Digibro simply didn't put in any effort towards this video or his critique. Besides, just saying ""lol, nothing new was added by the comment"" beleaguers the point. You say videos of varying length are all ""redundant"" to some extent, and - in certain aspects - that's not really wrong.]

Where the fault with your comment lies is that there are videos out there that aren't redundant or bring to light new aspects that - while of course they become obvious after you've seen them - most people simply wouldn't have thought of. Supereyepatchwolf, for one, is a great anituber in this regard. Bestguyever is also one of the best in bringing to light aspects of anime or issues that no one else ever brings up. Cartoon Cypher is another fantastic one. You just have to branch out to the minor leagues instead of solely relying on the big names, as of course those names are going to simply repeat the same shit over and over again.

While other anitubers like The Anime Man, Mother's Basement, or Glass Reflection have their niches and also can be redundant, the worst offender of all of this is Digibro for a few fairly simple reasons: Digibro is jaded and cynical. 

He's not an analytical anituber - he's a reactionary. Everything that he puts out is stamped with his stereotypical angst and because of that he, more often than not, doesn't ever add anything new to the conversation. It's actually one of the biggest reasons I can't stand his videos; he has almost no positive commentary and instead jumps to conclusions without giving thought beyond what he sees (which usually means he never gets past the first episode, or maybe the third). He's become so nihilistic regarding anime, that everything he says is just that: crude and worthless. For chrissakes, he did those entire 20 some odd ""Why The Asterisk War Sucks"" videos without actually understanding what he's talking about. Granted, while I'm not a huge fan of The Asterisk War, the mere fact he went that in depth as to why he hates it is beyond enough to understand his motivations - not to mention his ridiculous ""How To Tell An Anime Sucks From One Episode"" video.

That's just the kind of person he is: angry, jaded and has the desire to spread that hate to everyone so they can also hate the things he hates. Go through his videos and look to see what he actually likes. There's literally maybe five videos talking about something he enjoyed, and his KonoSuba video is about as close to a positive perspective as you're going to get from him.

You say it's to present the ideas in a simple and interesting way. In the case of Digibro, that's simply not the case. He's not providing any interesting content, he's simply being redundant about the same issues he's had from the very beginning. If people find that to be enlightening, so be it. But, in my opinion, his commentary is about as far away from legitimate critique and being interesting than any other anituber. And that's saying a lot.

Digibro is just not someone you want to have dictate new ideas and positions, because 9 times out of 10 those positions are ""This sucks and if you like it, you suck"". That very attitude has become systemic and is influencing a great many anime fans as he happens to be one of the most popular, if not the most popular commentator. To say that he's providing a novel approach and that's ultimately the point of watching his shows is just a great disservice to the anime fandom on the whole. He simply is not one to take seriously, and I believe he'd agree with me on that.

EDIT: I should also point out that Digibro is banned from /r/anime for a reason. None of the other anitubers are, so ask yourself: why Digibro? It's definitely not just because he kept propping up his own videos. There was more to it than that, and a lot of it had to do with his attitude.

EDIT 2: Also, your comment that ""In every video from an analytical youtuber there always a guy going that it's ""basic"" or ""stating the obvious"" is just plain ignorant. Honestly, I've never seen any of what you claim to be the standard when it comes to an individual commenting that something is ""basic"" or whatever. It feels like you just made it up in order to make your half-baked point. Granted, I didn't meant to come across as critical, but the fact that you started your comment laughing that apparently people continually call anime youtube videos pedantic just cut me the wrong way since it seems you just don't know what you're attempting to get at, as all of your rebuttals lack any sort of cohesion and proof.

They're not a conspiracy who have the power to take anything away from you. They are our little sisters.

"You might want to get a cup of tea or something because this is going to take a while to explain all of your logical errors and misunderstandings though I hope we come out of this ahead.

Yes most aspects of agriculture won't directly involve you just as most activities on the planet are ""things other people did"". It's a logical error to assert actions of others don't impact you as indirect impacts can be of the very same severity as direct ones. The impact of ""other people"" not growing enough food in our society is exactly the same as if you didn't grow/hunt enough yourself in a subsistence society. The only reason you or anybody else for that matter is alive is because of things other people did. The people who invented crop rotation, the people who figured out through the study of evolution that genetic diversity is critical to reducing famine, if these things didn't happen there is a good chance you wouldn't be here (probably the largest impact of all).

Now for your analogy - accounting does have an incredible impact on your life, once again you're assuming something doesn't simply because you know nothing of it, a case of prideful ignorance if ever I saw. Apart from the fact that even medium sized businesses couldn't function without accounting you also have the direct impacts associated with accounting gone bad, for example the Enron accounting scandal which wiped $2 billion from the pensions of their 20,000 employees was a pretty direct impact for them. And yes, as a society we do require the teaching of mathematics which is a fundamental requirement for accounting, just as evolution is a fundamental requirement for biology. 

Also yes we would prevent the teaching of non-mathematical based systems of accounting because just like with evolution there is no alternate theory of accounting. We would never take seriously a superstitious approach to accounting such as throwing goat bones and interpreting from how they land the value of our liquid assets.

Another massive logical fault in your argument is that of knowing about something being equal to impact_. You said ""the average person need know nothing about anyone else's trade"" and that somehow that denotes a lack of impact. You don't know how to run a power plant I assume but you'd certainly see the impact of a power outage just as nobody cares if what you think about the impact of evolution but you'd feel the impact pretty quickly if you didn't have food or medicine. 

For the last point I think it's extremely clear that the opinions of unqualified people do not matter - I don't ask my plumber for a medical assessment and physicists won't take a democratic vote to determine the value of 'c'. In fact in almost any profession you care to check (except politics) systems are devised to keep ridiculous and uninformed ideas from muddying the pool. This is precisely where the term experts comes into play.

If you aren't aware how evolution impacts the world, or how accounting has contributed to the large scale growth of societies, then why would your opinion on any of these topics be worth anything at all, the supreme arrogance here is in your hubris that you should be listened to even when speaking from a megaphone of unqualified ignorance.

When faced with an argument or debate on topics where you have no knowledge the sane, rational, productive, and I dare say even the polite thing to do is either hold your tongue or ask questions of experts and professionals to learn more about it.

"I was going to use ""legendary eye"" but I felt that was too easy for you to attack since the true legendary eye is the Rinnegan.

I can understand why you think that though. It's easy to just view the series and what is directly presented to us and take that at face value. But the truth isn't as simple as thinking ""well all these uchihas we've seen have mangekyou, so it can't possibly be rare"". I feel like it's exactly these kinds of ""intuitive"" thinking that makes people reach these inaccurate conclusions and beliefs. 

I'm not claiming it to be in the same league as the Rinnegan, but how did you draw the line at that? Nothing states that Rinnegan somehow makes genjutsu work differently on a fundamental level.

"You forgot one more fundamental difference between USA sports and the rest of the world: In the USA the ""players"" are not real players, instead they are just complex game pieces that are played by a coach (or team of coaches) who actually make most of the tactics and strategy decisions.

Let me explain: When you say you ""know"" how to play a game, there are actually several levels of knowing:

1. Knowing the rules and how to not make invalid/illegal moves.
2. Knowing fundamentals (how to kick a ball, how to throw a ball, now to do dribbling etc). There is also a level 2.5 that would consist of knowing pre-defined combinations of fundamentals.
3. Knowing tactics (how to chose the best fundamentals for each moment to archive a short term gain or objective)
4. Knowing strategy (how to chose the best tactics to archive the major game goals)

For example in soccer, the players (individually and as a team) are responsible for all four levels. The coaches in soccer are afforded very little input to players during the game, so their role is mostly limited to just gran-strategy, which is defining guidelines for the players to make strategy decisions themselves in real-time in the middle of the game. During game play each player needs to be constantly making tactics and strategy decisions, defining his(hers) own positioning taking in consideration the positioning of all his team, the opposing team and the ball. In this context the player with the ball momentarily defines the tactics and strategy of the whole team, but even that doesn't mean that the other players are just being directed, instead they have to use their awareness to open up new tactics and strategies by using his(her) positioning; and to recognize tactics and strategies being open by other players and changing yours to match theirs.

On American-Football on the other hand, the ""players"" have very little autonomy to make tactical decisions and (with very few exceptions) almost no autonomy at all to make strategic decisions. Instead, the coach(es) makes all the strategic decisions and the ""players"" are simply told what to do and consequently also told what their teammates will do, they are responsible only for executing pre-rehearsed combinations of fundamentals, spending most of their time thinking at most at level 2.5 and just some times doing some basic tactics decisions. The real player on American-Football is the coach, the people in the field are just very very complex chess pieces."

"1 - I don't get a tipsy feeling from one glass of wine. And if I did, then I'd personally stop myself before I get ""tipsy"". I drink alcohol because of the flavour and rich traditional history (I'm half German, from a region that's made wine and for over a thousand years). Having been actually tipsy and high before, the two are not even remotely compatible. Being ""tipsy"" or ""warm"" from a bit of alcohol is barely an altered state of mind compared to being full on high from weed. Everyone is different, but the point is you should do your best to not get into an altered/intoxicated state of mind. So if slightly ""tipsy"" is too intoxicated for you, then don't drink to that point.


2 - Be honest with yourself, how many people do you actually know that smoke just a tiny amount to ""relax"" and then put the weed away because they don't want to get high. Don't kid yourself man. I know most Americans don't have a good example of calm casual drinking, because the culture here seems to be about getting hammered all the time. But being originally from Europe, I know endless people that drink responsibly. Counter that with weed usage here in North America, I've never EVER seen anyone use weed in a way that I would consider ""responsible"" (except for medically). I used to sell drugs before I cleaned up my sinful life (small then wholesale). Weed was the least harmful thing I sold yet I saw it destroy plenty of lives. Mental addiction to weed is very real, and it absolutely has semi-permanently changed the minds of 80% of people that I know who are on it. That's something I have to live with, knowing I was the source for their current issues and dysfunction. Nobody can tell me weed is ""100% harmless"", or that people use it very responsibly. Maybe if they had started using weed at 20+, but most of these people started out real young and their minds are basically mush now (at least to my standards of what I expected from a smart and function human).


3 - I've known PLENTY of people who got violent while on weed. Every single time there was a problem that needed to get dealt with with violence (things which I have and continue to repent for), everyone around me smoked weed before we grabbed weapons to do what we thought we needed to do. Sometimes drinking too, but EVERY time it was weed. Once I got out of that world, I realized it was to drown out our conscience. At the time we saw it as hyping us up to ""put in work"".


4 - I admit my opinion is also because I'm a convert from a charasmatic Jamaican non-denominational church, where weed usage was high and the excuses for the drug were constant. As was the dysfunction it brought to the church. So I'm just being a typical convert that is over-the-top Orthodox. But I do stand by my opinion which is backed by Scripture, the Apostles, the Church father's, and Church rules. I see absolutely no way in which getting high is productive for a pious Orthodox Christian, who is aiming to achieve theosis."

I actually knew you'll say that, and I also know if I cited any Hindu scholars than you would end up by saying he/she is vaishnava or anti-vedantic or convert of Buddhism/Jainism or blah blah! 

Let start from beginning.

The first mention of Shiva (as modern day Shiva) is in Shvetashvatara Upanishad, It is a foundational text of the philosophy of Shaivism as well as the Yoga and Vedanta schools of Hinduism. Came somewhere around 6th to 5th century BCE. (Waaaaay too ahead of puranas)

This Upanishad NEVER associate Shiva with Lingam. Nor with idols. And it is not written by any Western scholars either. 

Read few verses from it.

---


Let us know that highest great lord of lords, the highest deity of deities, the master of masters,
his high power is revealed as manifold, as inherent, acting as force and knowledge.
There is no master of his in the world, no ruler of his, not even a sign of him,
He is the cause, the lord of the lords of the organs, and there is of him neither parent nor lord.
He is the one God, hidden in all beings, all prevading, the self within all beings,
watching over all works, dwelling in all beings, the witness, the perceiver, the only one, free from qualities.
The wise who perceive Him dwelling within their self, to them belongs eternal happiness and serenity, not to others,
He who knows this God as primal cause, through Sāṁkhya (reason, reflection)[83] and Yoga (self-discipline), achieves Mukti (freedom, moksha).

 Shvetashvatara Upanishad 6.7-6.13

I will again repeat what I have said before, puranas arent written in one time span, nor by one guru nor by one sect. Its a long, consistant attempt that were written over centuries by various people, influenced by or influenced with some indigenous and many sramanic adaptions. So DONOT take them literal. 

And one more thing, I'm not against shaiviSm (hell I respect all) and I find myself more inclined to shaiv philosophy than any other but there are many misconceptions that somewhere (perhaps) corrupt the true meaning, though it's not unique in Hinduism, every religion has this problem. You don't need Shiva Lingam to be with Shiva, hell Aghoris (most strict Shaiv sect) 'generally' don't worship Lingam, there are no shivlingam in cremation ground. Read yoga sutras of patanjali and learn the art of samadhi, sit in samadhi for hours and you'll find Shiva more closer to you than Shiva Lingam, and perhaps that's what Shvetashvatara Upanishad wants to tell."

">So no response to the polls I cited, just changing the subject. Thanks.

Because I find them unconvincing. It's one thing to say ""the government should be in charge of providing insurance"" in a poll. It's another entirely to attach funding mechanisms and the realization that you won't get to keep your own plan or maybe not even the doctor you like and to see this specific plan in action. 

Colorado was a state that was wrestling with exactly that. And it got overwhelmingly defeated at the polls. Something being popular in the abstract =/= it being popular in concrete form. 

>Hr676 includes provisions for retraining insurance industry workers but beyond that, a large chunk of our economy is being subsidized by americans paying the highest prices in the world for services that deliver substandard health outcomes. That isn't money well spent.

Nobody's saying we don't need to fix healthcare. But there are plenty of countries in the world that have robust private insurance sectors, even using them to achieve universal coverage. Single-payer is a pipe dream.

>Because you don't understand the arguments well enough to comment on them yourself, only to throw out generalizations about ' it costs too much ' and ' I heard people don't even want single payer '. Real astute political mind.

First of all, don't be a fucking dick. No, because it's complicated and I don't feel like writing it all out myself, especially when an actual industry expert looking at stats and numbers has done it for me.

Here's a number for you: Some 4/5ths of Americans like the coverage they currently have through their employer or individual plan. They like the doctor they have. A single-payer system will by nature kick those people off their plans. You can say ""oh, the new one will be better and cheaper"" but people are irrational, emotional creatures, as the ACA reaction should tell you. 

And who says the doctors they like will accept this new plan? After all, we're keeping costs down, right? Would you force all medical professionals to start earning less money? Maybe the doctors only go to the supplemental private plans where they can earn more. 

Again, read the Nation article, because it is a comprehensive look at the pitfalls here. We already had a healthcare fight that we barely won to get the ACA. We don't need a new one. Let's patch the ACA rather than pushing a completely new system."

the deen (way/core beliefs, there is no god, and nothing worthy of worship except Allah [](/swt) and we affirm all the prophets, that He sent) remains the same, while only the shari'a (law) may change, you misunderstood this about Islam.

- (..) This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion. (..) [5:3]

- And (remember) when 'Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: ""O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allâh unto you confirming the Taurât [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmed . But when he (Ahmed i.e. Muhammad) came to them with clear proofs, they said: ""This is plain magic."" [61:6]

>throwawaytx22: Why would God create a system that turns to what it had?

ever heard of free will or judgement day? earthly life is obviously not the place of ultimate justice, but rather it is a test, thereby giving humans the opportunity to become even better than the angels (who only obey without free will) or worse than the animals (who obey their instincts and often show social behavior, and do what Allah [](/swt) has commanded them).

if you didn't know that, then you didn't know one of the most basic principles of Islam.

"Pulgar was a huge outlier so far, there's no doubt.

As to the Elo question, you're simply not understanding the concept, which is kind of funny because it's the part of what I said that helps your original argument. 

You use the rating range of ""1400-1700"" for your example. This shows right there an inherent lack of understanding of the concept to begin with. For one, there's nothing inherently true about Elo rating where you can say ""let's say their true rating is X"". It's only a rating relative to the pool it's played in. So to say ""let's assume they're rated 1400-1700"" is an unreasonable assumption. For one it gives credence to the idea that there's some sort universally true rating that you can assign to each player, which there isn't. Secondly, why would the range be so tight? In reality, they'd have terrible players in this pool as well. So if you were to give them each a FIDE rating equivalent, a more fair assumption would be something like 600-2600.

On an island where there's no 2700 fide players, we'd get one of them reaching 2700 anyways. It doesn't matter what their fide rating would be, the cream would still rise to the top. This isn't really up for debate. This is how it works. If you don't have an intuitive understanding of the math of this, I'm sorry I won't be able to spend any more of my time explaining it to you."

">I help run a local homebrew club and I haven't ever seen any of the members treat women differently in a beer sense.

Two points.

First, I think the kind of behavior we're talking about here is less likely in the context of something like a homebrew club, which will tend to be a small group of people who know each other reasonably well. You see it much more at festivals and craft beer bars, where there's a common presumption that any women you see were likely 'dragged along by their husband or boyfriend and don't actually know anything about beer.' That's paraphrasing a friend of mine who's been brewing for 20 years and still gets warned that she probably won't like the dark beers, or the hoppy ones.

Second, just because you don't see something doesn't mean it's not happening. It's really tempting to believe that shitty stuff that happens outside of your sphere of experience just isn't happening at all. But it's lying to yourself, too. 

>I think people are reacting poorly because it's not a beer thing, it's a douchey guy thing.

I don't think anyone suggested it was ""a beer thing."" But it is very much a problem in the craft beer community, because, well, there happen to be a lot of douchey guys in this community. The worst possible reaction non-douchey guys can have to people highlighting that problem is to pretend that it doesn't exist. If you don't want douchebags in your community, don't give them shadows in which to hide.

I've been in craft beer my entire adult life, and I figure I have about two to three decades on most people in here. I know dozens of female brewers, professional and otherwise, and dozens more who have been in the community as long as I have, and pretending that craft beer doesn't have an ugly undercurrent of sexism would, for me, mean denying all of the experiences I've heard from them over the years. That doesn't mean labeling craft beer ""sexist""; it just means being realistic about the problems we have."

I always recommend starting with the unconscious bias at work workshop at Google Ventures. They explain the issues quite well and the page also contains sources.

> I'm talking about not having to think about what I say for fear of offending someone. This is a direct infringement on my freedom of speech, is it not?

There are two subtly different, but connected parts to this and I'm not sure, which one you are asking. One is the ""I don't want to offend someone, so I don't say what I'm thinking"" part. That clearly doesn't violate any of your rights, because it's fundamentally your choice. You are free to say what you want, you just don't. The other is the ""I am forbidden to say things that I want to say"" part. And that also doesn't violate your rights, because xkcd. You can say whatever you want, but you have to accept the consequences, that people might not like you afterwards and choose not to work with you anymore. That's a fundamental property of human nature. It is our right as a community to chose who can participate in it and profit from it and if we choose to only interact with people who we don't consider assholes, then you will just have to live outside of our community or choose not to be an asshole (I use ""asshole"" in a liberal interpretation here for simplification. Please note that there are nuances both to ""levels of assholenes"" and ""levels of exclusion from the community"").

I strongly suggest you come up with a better term instead of ""free speech"". I can accept that it is convenient and useful for your cause (because it is emotionally laden and a strong buzzword in the internet culture, because it is so much influenced by US culture). But it is also already reserved for scenarios that have the specific power imbalance between governments and their people.

> I simply cannot comprehend how I can be involved in a discussion, then you say that you find what I said offensive and expect me to apologise? This concept literally does not make sense to me. You are in fact saying that I have committed a wrong act by speaking openly about a topic.

This is wrong on two parts: a) Just because I expect you to apologize doesn't mean, I necessarily think you have done something wrong, knowingly. As a crude analogue: If child A steals something from child B, it might not know that this was a wrong act. I still expect A to apologize to B, because I want it to learn that it was wrong indeed and to acknowledge the fact that it accepted that it was wrong. In that sense, I view an apology maybe as a way to admit to a wrong, but not necessarily as an admission of malice. I expect apologies for honest mistakes too.
And the second axis where what you say is wrong is that you talk about a topic, while I talk about what you are saying and how you are saying stuff. You are free to talk about racism (the topic), but if you say that all Mexicans are rapists (""what"" you say) or if you call me a cunt talking the finer points of geopolitics (""how"" you say it) I do believe you did something wrong. 

> I don't know of any 1st world country that punishes people for insulting or talking about something that some find offensive.

Again, you are ever so subtly and unintentionally twisting what I'm saying :) You gave a definition of ""attack"" that purely involved physical acts. I countered by pointing out that this definition is too narrow and that indeed most countries have laws that also punish non-physical violence. Think about mobbing for example, or (some forms of) stalking.

If you are unhappy with the usage of the term ""violence"" or ""attack"" for these, I am happy to substitute them. But the fact is, that most countries recognize by law, that you can cause harm to other people without physically interacting with them.

> Which is why laws have nothing to do with the bars I set myself. My bars are set based on rationality derived from evidence and logical thought.

But then you are agreeing, that the laws are not enough and not a justification not to have a CoC? Because, again, the context in which I said what you responded too was you claiming, that conferences don't need a CoC, because there are already the laws which also apply to this conference."

"Ok, honestly I couldn't care less about natural hair color. Albinos even have natural white hair. Asian albinos are still Asians. I am not sure what point you are trying to make. 

My take is:

1. They are definitely not ""Caucasian"".

2. As long as they are: sharing the same cultural experience, and perceived by the society in the same way as us in the West. Then they are Golden people. No doubt.

The concept of ""Mongoloid"" was created by European. In this frame work, EA/SEA/CA people are also grouped together with Polynesians, Melanesians and Native Americans. 

Frankly speaking, we look very alike Native Americans and Polynesians, and we support all of their cause since they are literally the same people as us. What divided us is the culture, language and historical experience. They already have their own movement to be busy with. As long as any of them are interested in culture and languages in EA/SEA, and want to participate in our movement, they are very welcome to join our cause.

For the case of some Melanesian, I am damn sure they are not perceived in the same way as us in the society, although genetically they might be closer to us than Africans. It's very hard to bridge two communities 1) who don't share similar appearances, social experience, historical experience, cultural and language heritage. Except linguistically they are Austronesian(it's a huge hodgepodge, due to plenty isolated islands, most of the languages in this system are not mutually intelligible), the commonality between EA/SEA and Melanesian is almost empty. OK. They are ""Mongoloid"", no bash. My question is:are they really effective allies to be grouped with?



tl;dr: instead of being bugged with certain isolated communities(Melanesian) or small number of special cases (blonde Asian or Albino Asian), we need to prioritize the effort on grouping, resonating, uniting those who share the more commonality and experience with us. Two criteria for determining ""groupability"": 1) how similar are we living our lives? 2) how similar are we perceived by the society.

However, if you simply enjoy exploring the variation of nature (in the sense of anthropology), it is really interesting and sometimes entertaining."

"Actually, for 3-years we've been monogamous and dealt with a lot of her problems. She's gone from physically injured from work and clinically depressed, to finishing her Master's thesis, getting a pretty enjoyable job, dealing with some old family problems, and generally getting back to being an amazing, happy woman during the time she's been with me. I spent a year cooking and shopping for her while she did statistics and wrote her thesis. 
Now we're considering opening the relationship, and I was asking how prudent this rule is. Honestly, I'm not expecting to have much going from my side. This is primarily to allow her to explore her bisexuality. I might have some relationships with friends deepen; but I'm just as happy being monogamous.

"Really, you just claimed the only people supporting McCain by then were racists, and you think the impetus is on me to prove otherwise and explain my ""thought process?"" Are you aware you're praising a man for giving a message you clearly don't understand?"
"The type of thinking you're advocating creates the perfect shield for so-called skeptics, protecting them from ever having to address any possible new empirical observations. Especially when the topic has elements of strangeness, taboo, and fear. And that is exactly why those skeptics continually fall back on it, ""it"" being the type of sloppy thinking you'll find over at BadUFOs. Because they don't have to do any real work, and don't have to leave their intellectual comfort zones.

The sloppy thinking over there is often something like this:

1) Start with the assumption that alien-based UFOs can't get to Earth from other star systems.

2) Sprinkle on a little of ""if aliens could get here, it would be so rare as to be a probability of basically zero. [Insert meaningless Drake Equation calculation based on more assumptions.]”

3) Now that they've improperly set the rules, the ""skeptics"" over there can (as you're trying to do here with Bayes' Theorem) eliminate the strangest elements of any strong UFO case by simply appealing to probability -- ""overall it's much more likely that the object was an aircraft, and we've found some hugely improbable yet mundane event that could almost semi-plausibly explain that element of this UFO case. And therefore (because UFOs are improbable, remember?), all this other evidence can be dismissed, too. So, in conclusion, the UFO in this case must have just been an aircraft."" Tada! Case solved! (And note that the people over there 100% do consider themselves to have solved the RB-47 case. Amazing....)

4) And now we get to the part some self-labeled skeptics love the most: sit and wait, while impatiently drumming their fingers, for the UFOlogists -- UFOlogists who are almost entirely part-time and amateurish, necessarily -- to provide the skeptics with the ""extraordinary evidence"" that would be needed in order to prove that true UFOs are real.

It's just so easy. And ignores so much....

First of all, why are amateurs and not scientists doing the ""proving"" here?

Could amateurs even possibly meet that burden?

Can anyone think of any other topics where scientists have done basically nothing even after literally hundreds of thousands of observations, with thousands of them buttressed by possibly-compelling physical evidence? (Maybe compelling, maybe not... but we'll never know without experts... also known as ""scientists."")

I thought the way it worked was that there's some kind of initial, lesser burden of evidence, one that falls short of proof, yet signals to the scientists that they need to look at and prove the issue?

And here's the important part, which addresses why appeals to probability are almost meaningless: how do we know how probable or improbable true UFOs are? What is the basis for the skeptics' rarely-stated but obviously-prevalent assumption that true UFOs must be either non-existent or unimaginably rare? In order to assign a probability that any one sighting is or isn't a true UFO, we'd need to know the ratio of true UFO sightings to UFO misidentifications / hoaxes / etc., right? But that's the question: out of hundreds of thousands of reported sightings, are 10,000 of them legitimate UFOs? Or is it 100? Or is it 0?

We don't know.

So how are Printy, et al., justified in dismissing a strange element of a strong UFO case by simply reciting that it's ""more probable"" that the object was actually something mundane? That's as circular as circular reasoning gets. Begging the question in the truest sense of the phrase -- assume your premise is true, and then use it to basically ""prove"" itself.

And appeals to Bayes' Theorem are way premature. We first need need to eliminate from the discussion all ""skeptics"" who can't clear the most basic of logical hurdles. And then we'd need to know something about the actual probability of a sighting being a true UFO. Which we don't know, and is exactly why anyone's discussing this topic at all.

Welcome back to the beginning! And that -- 'round and 'round we go! -- is what the issue will be, always, until enough experts with real credentials start speaking up."

"Dead wrong. I own part of a primitive campground in North Georgia that used outhouses for a while: we had to move them every couple of years because they fill up with waste. Our lake registered higher e-coli and other fecal choliform levels each year until we got rid of the outhouses- and we weren't hosting thousands of people year-round, only a couple of events per year with a couple hundred campers there for no more than a week. We knew how to treat the pits, constructed the drainage to perk at optimum efficiency, all the right things. The result? They stank to high heaven, were full of wasps' nests and huge spiders, and more than once we had to run a raccoon or snake or skunk out of the latrine. Outhouses vanished from society when a better way of disposing of waste was developed. Why? Outhouses, latrines and shit-pits are vibrant breeding grounds for disease, they attract flies and other insects which spread disease, provide a hiding place for snakes, spiders and vermin.

"> This is theoretical computer science, and requires things like infinite tapes, and at some point there is a reduction to the machine level. High level languages are just emulators of that.

No reasonable algorithm will take up enough memory to fill the memory of a modern computer; never mind a cheap external hard drive. Furthermore, emulating a Turing machine in a modern programming language is next to trivial. This should not be an obstacle in any way. That chart is not understandable in any way without more context, but if that is the entire algorithm -- and the bubbles contain steps as short as ""look this specific thing up in a dictionary"" -- then you should be able to write it in a modern programming language in a matter of hours -- maybe days, if I'm strongly overestimating it.

">No, someone need not be shot. The point you should take from Chekov's gun is that every part of the story need be essential. Nobody needs to be shot to make the gun important, as by virtue of hanging in the wall, it already functions as characterization. A person who hangs a gun, is very different from a person who does not. You gain hints on a person's personality this way in a very elegant, subtle way. A man with guns, who never uses them, is a completely valid story to tell. Saying that it must go off is exaggeration. People like you, who take things too literally, are abusing it, and are writing predictable, terrible stories.

When they say, ""there's a gun on the wall,"" there is no predicate for what kind of person is hanging a gun on the wall or how they are hanging it. It could be for practical reasons or for ornamentary reasons.

I wasn't even saying that the part about her hearing the voice itself was the real breaking point. This is just another bullshit red herring about a point I wasn't really arguing that much in the first place. I brought it up, sure, I've never really stated that Yui not being active was a particularly strong reason for the logical incoherency of the scene.

"What convinced me was the flood gates that must logically be opened by its permission. 

First we allow married couples to use contraception. This tells us that openness to life is not an intrinsic part of marriage. If that is true then contrary to the very clear theology of creation, covenant, and sacrament, gay marriage is possible, and further the Church must admit that it is. Strike 1. 

There is a contraceptive advert ""sin twice: use a condom"". This works because the Church says a condom is never licit. By allowing it in licit sex, you'd be hard pressed to convince anyone that it is explicitly not allowed in illicit sex. If the easiest practical solution is allowed when following the law, practicality must be allowed when not following the law. There is now no practical barrier (I don't want extramarital children therefore I won't) to fornication. Strike 2.

Now to the killer. Contraception is not 100% effective. The number of extramarital unwanted pregnancies where the mother feels she has a moral right to not be pregnant because ""I did everything right"" soars. Abortions go up. Strikes 3 - infinity. 

I understand your confusion, it took me a while too. But contraception leads to abortion, so it cannot be allowed. If you don't believe me, open your eyes."

">You keep presenting faulty analogies. 

You claim that it is faulty without anything to back it up. Rights are cultural institutions, like marriages and money.

>What I asked was, if we grant that a right had been proved, what would be the consequence?

This question is nonsensical. Rights aren't theorems. They aren't proved. They are declared, recognized, granted, asserted, etc.

>No, I asserted that, applying the standards you set (i.e., ""we can make anything a right""), we would logically deduce that nothing is a right.

And it does not follow. Just like 'we can marry any two people, therefore no one is married' or 'we can make anything currency (paper, coins, bitcoins), therefore nothing is currency.' Please actually do logically deduce it, and I'll concede the point. Until then it's empty rhetoric to say that you could do it. I'll repeat myself: no matter how much you need to misread me, I don't endorse moral relativism.

>By asserting that ""we can make anything a right,"" you denied both the absolute existence of rights and the objective existence of rights.

No, for the same reason that married people and currency exist objectively. Unless you have a weird definition of what exists.

>Again, neither moral realism nor consequentialism would permit that ""we can make anything a right.""

A consequentialist, say an utilitarian, could, to make it simple, just say that the only moral fact is that one should maximize utility, while still holding that rights (like currency and marriages) are human institutions, albeit ones that tend to maximize utility in most (but not all) circumstances. That is a perfectly coherent stance.

>If moral facts exist, then it cannot possibly be true that ""we can make anything a right."" 

Give a non question-begging reason why. 

Before you try, get this through your thick head: rights and moral facts are not mutually entailing concepts. If you think they are mutually entailing, that is a substantive thesis, not a conceptual one, thus you have to argue for it.

>The existence of moral facts is, however, the very basis of natural rights theory.

Sure, but natural rights theory is far from being entailed by moral realism, which I fucking endorse.

>You expressly claimed that ""we can make anything a right."" This is the very essence of relativism.

You shoud produce an argument for this claim instead of merely repeating it.

>>No. That doesn't follow. All it would show is that natural selection has resulted in certain individuals expressing approval or disapproval of certain behavior. You can't jump from this to a metaphysical thesis.

>Not only does it follow--it's the same statement reiterated. A general biological predisposition to approve and disapprove of certain behavior is an innate moral impulse.

Nope, and I'm not surprised you don't see the distinction. Approval and disapproval are public, observable behavior. A moral impulse is an unobservable, para-mechanical explanation of that behavior. There is no reason to jump from one to the other, which is my point. Also, I didn't say individuals were pre-disposed, but that the behavior would be the result of natural selection. Different claims.

Anyway I reject the premise which states that approval and disapproval, which are learned social practices, are biologically determined.

>If you would really like to know, then I suggest you do some research on this topic. The relation between our chemical and biological matter and our moral impulses is a pretty ""hot"" issue at the moment, across several academic disciplines. However, it's usually the extent and nature of this relationship that I've seen debated, rather than the existence of the relationship, which is so self-evident that it seems presumed. By the way, philosophically, this fits under the banner of materialism. Maybe you skipped that wikipedia article?

Empty rhetoric. Stop bullshitting. Things that are so self-evident as to be presumed are called prejudice or dogma. But far from being self-evident, the idea that normativity reduces to biology is highly contested. I'm a philosophy grad student, I don't need wikipedia, and materialism is utterly irrelevant to this discussion.

>Anyway, some simple observational evidence 

is insufficient to assert metaphysical theses like moral realism. Are you even trying?

>of a material basis for morality includes (i) the cross-cultural commonality of various moral precepts 

Cool. 'All cultures agree that X is wrong, therefore X is wrong as a matter of fact' is a non-sequitur. Ad populum. Also has nothing to do with a 'material basis.'

>and (ii) brain pathology exhibited in many who commit ""immoral"" acts, as compared to brains of morally ""normal"" people.

This is so weak. The scare quotes just show how weak even you believe it is. Is correlation causation now? What about immoral behavior of people with healthy brains? Couldn't this also be explained by the fact that we have a tendency to marginalize (i.e. express disapproval of) people with certain pathologies? And again, this is nothing to show the existence of moral facts, because that would require that expressions of approval or disapproval be correct or incorrect, have truth-value. This is something which no amount of biology could ever prove.

>But we do not need to locate a ""moral gene"" to determine that there is a genetic (i.e., bio-chemical and heritable) basis for morality.

Genetic doesn't mean 'bio-chemical and heritable', it means 'pertaining to genes'. Stop moving the goalposts to wiggle out of your bullshit claims.

>And to the extent you think this is a claim I invented, I'm sorry to tell you that such a misapprehension must proceed from, and demonstrate, your woeful ignorance of the subject matter.

Did you cum yet? Again: philosophy grad student, top of class, full scholarship. All I read here is empty rhetoric, pure bullshit and projection. I master the underlying issues and have to break them down for your dumb ass.

>>We invented them precisely so that they would override pretty much everything else, including the prerogatives of kings.

>You've already suggested that there are moral truths. Did we invent those?

Nope. No matter how many times you fail to understand it, it simply is a fact that moral realism and rights being human institutions are compatible claims. I even explained how rights could have their normative force given such a framework, and all you could do was scoff.

>Again, there is no man-made institution which by its existence suffices to mandate a person's admission into another such institution.

Rights don't do that either. Suppose I grant that rights don't depend on institutions. Now imagine most social institutions have broken down and a powerful warlord wants to enslave you. The mere existence of the right to liberty will not prevent your enslavement. The right's efficiency clearly depends on its being agreed that it is a right, on institutional practices of recognizing and asserting rights. Without such practices the mere metaphysical existence of a right doesn't do shit.

Isn't it more parcimonious to say that rights are nothing but the institutional practices of declaring, granting, accepting, asserting, etc. rights? Just like currency is nothing but the practices of central banks to declare certain special pieces of paper to be so and banks, consumers, workers and businesses to accept that they are so? Without institutions, money would be worthless, and rights would have no force. Now a right with no force is as much of a contradiction as worthless money."

"herein lies the issue.. cat is 30 feet up. Generally speaking, extension ladders carried by many FD's are less than 30 feet. Some departments carry laders that are 30+ but they are unwieldy and need several people to set up and use safely (5 people). 

Also, a ladder truck with one of their ladders in use is (at least where I served) is considered ""out of service"" until said ladder can be taken down and secured back on the truck.

So if they use a portable 30+ ladder, the truck is out of service until the cat recovery is completed or the big ladder can be taken down and secured. 99.99% of the time, that won't be an issue. but that .001% where a crew was late responding to an active job due to the cat could possibly delay a rescue operation, and in a worst case scenario, a human fatality. 

In that unlikely, but ever present case, the FD would be crucified publicly.

""but what about a ladder truck that has a large ladder mounted on the top of a truck that can be controlled by hydraulics by one guy? Why not use that instead of the 5 man, 30+ foot portable?""

Glad you asked. As a safety measure, ladder trucks cannot deploy a mounted ladder without first jacking the truck up on hydraulic stabilizers. The ladder controls will not function until 4 (generally), independently controlled jacks are set and the sensors on the truck tell the computer that deployment of the ladder is safe. 

To be frank, it takes some time to deploy (and subsequently retract) any fixed ladder system, once again, putting the ladder truck ""out of service"" for those critical few minutes in that 99.99% chance that something goes very wrong for someone else (IE: their house is on fire).

Now, when you made contact with the FD and they were eating dinner, yes at that moment they were probably relaxing and having some tasty grub. And there is a very good chance that in the time they were eating said very good grub, nothing that was critical would happen....

BUT if they stopped eating, put the ladder truck out of commission and went to help your cat, and a true emergency happened, they'd be caught with their pants down and open to a number of lawsuits that could in fact bankrupt the department/county/city etc.

Could the guys have done the job? Sure. Would they do it? probably... but like any other job in the world, they gotta cover their own ass first. Given the volatile nature and potential implications of working in any of the emergency services (FD, PD, EMS, Hospitals etc etc) I would expect them to act just as you described.

I assure you, it was not a personal assault against you or your cat (who I imagine you are quite fond of) but they need to protect themselves while working in a field that is very prone to wrongful death/injury lawsuits

I'm sorry that your local FD has left you with a bad taste in your mouth, but god forbid you or someone you love has a real emergency, would you want those guys tied up saving someone's cat?


(please note, I mean no offense to you at all. I am just trying to help you see it from the FD's eyes)

Also, enforced gun training and a practical test to demonstrate the training, preferably one that has to be taken periodically. Nobody on the street with a gun that isn't properly trained on how to handle one. Most of all, penalize anyone who doesn't handle it properly. 
 
I've seen the videos on how to handle a gun. Trigger control, never point a gun at something you don't want to hit, no matter if it's empty or on safety, etc (I do my research). This is what a lot of gun owners like to talk about on the subject of being a responsible gun owner, so there should be no problem with wanting to enforce it. "
"We get it. You pilots all want less AA and more countermeasures. How many new threads need to be started on this topic?

As far as I'm concerned, there could be some minor tweaks made to improve balance. Maybe. I haven't seen enough evidence of it yet. But from what I've seen, I don't think it needs much work.

MAA with ARMs need a nerf. I'll give you that. This AA mine seems dumb as all fuck. The concept of mobility hits would definitely be okay in reality, but I think it's unfair in a game. There should maybe be less types of lock on launchers. Yes, I agree there could be some improvements. SOME, but not all that are being requested.

What we don't need is crazy overpowered pilots again. If pilots got everything they want, we would return to the days of old where pilots go 60-0. Hell, there are still pilots in BF4 who can still come damn near matches like that. 

Even if you go 30-5 in a match in BF4, which is still very possible, is that not good enough? That's 25 net kills that have to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is other players. Hell, that's a pretty great match for infantry. You're still going to be topping the scoreboard. 

Battlefield isn't supposed to be a helicopter domination simulator. It has been in the past. We understand that would be fun for you, but it also makes other parts of the game much less fun for many people, just so pilots can have their fun. And other players paid the same for the game as you, and deserve to have just as much fun doing what they like in the game.

As far as I'm concerned, in my own limited experience with vehicles, I can hop in something and get a kill or two fairly reliably. If I practiced, I know I could do better. If I was great at it, I know I could still top the scoreboard like I still witness pilots do on a fairly regular basis.

So please. Pilots of /r/battlefield_4 ... we hear your frustrations. We know what you want. You can still have a positive k/d in helos. Dice isn't likely to make all of the changes you are requesting (yes, I know your post was specifically about below radar, but I'm hijacking it because I'm sick of the repetitive posts). 

Can we tone down the broken record a bit?

Edit: 

Not sure any of you will come back and see this edit, but so many of you replied that I can't respond to all of you on my phone. Like I said, I agree that some fixes are in order. But as we've learned with DICE, we need to be careful what we wish for. Implementing all of the fixes at once would surely ruin the game even more than the current state of things. 

Personally, I think that the lock detection failures and countermeasures not working properly should be the primary focus. Secondly, attack chopper agility needs to be increased. Thirdly, countermeasure cool down is definitely something that would be sensible in decreasing.

With balance issues, baby steps need to be taken with good amounts of testing to ensure that fixes don't throw balance way off in the other direction. Those first changes will put a challenge to the pilots. They would give the pilots the AH that they are asking for, and we'll see how they can perform with that. With their own equipment working properly, if there are still issues, then more steps can be taken. 

If those first changes aren't enough, then things like nerfing various AA should be taken into account. First and foremost, MAA ARMs and stigla lock time adjustments, because those two are the most complained about. Then if that still doesn't work, further steps can be taken.

Game balance doesn't happen overnight, and the point of my post was that excessive complaining about a ton of issues won't help any more than no change at all. It would be better to centralize ideas than to spam everything all over the place."

Since the price of schooling will be tied to the student's future income, and not the actual price of the service, if there is a disparity in this cost(We know due to past experience that tuition rates will rise far above inflation rates), the tax payer will be forced to pay it.

This is a start of the program and it can be amended to fix such problems. The State can and will step in to continue to allow our great citizens the freedom of affordable higher learning.

>This ""gamble"" you speak of is simply unjust. It is against all free market and liberty oriented principles for the government to set up a system where the same good or service can have a wildly different cost based on the income of individuals.

Again students sign a contract. No one is forcing them to sign up and use this program that is broadly supported by many. I would use this program if I could and I'm sure the vast majority of people would too. If this program helps me be very successful then I'm okay with paying whatever I have to.

"> You have to remember that to just get 1 more pound into space, you have to add more fuel. Then, you have to add more fuel to make up for that weight of the fuel, and you keep going until it equalizes. This is the key, you can't do this forever, at some point, at some gravity level, i'm sure before 125% more gravity, at our current ability to generate thrust from fuel, we will be unable to make space.

That's not how rockets work. A rocket is a giant, hollow tube where over 90% of the mass is the fuel weight. The volume of fuel scales faster than the volume of the container necessary to hold the fuel, so where a rocket that is the size of your arm may only be 50% fuel, a rocket that is the size of the empire state building is going to be well over 90%, and so on. 

As a result, you are postulating a gravitational world in which exploding fuel is not enough to propel its own mass upward - you are going to have to need much stronger gravity than 2.125X in order to achieve this. 

Is there a limit to how strong gravity can be and there still be an achievable escape velocity? Yes, for once, it's called a black hole. That has an escape velocity well over the speed of light. Similarly, I'm sure there is an escape velocity that would be unachievable through normal chemical combustion, but its a hell of a lot more than 2.25x earth gravity. 

Let's put it this way:

> You have to remember that to just get 1 more pound into space, you have to add more fuel.

Yes.

> Then, you have to add more fuel to make up for that weight of the fuel,

NO.

If fuel cannot propel itself off the ground, it is not fuel. You are talking about a universe in which there is no combustible substance that has more potential energy, releasable through a chemical process, than its own resting potential energy. To put it another way, you do not have to add fuel to a ship JUST to compensate for the weight of the existing fuel - it is a ratio of the output power of the fuel + the dead weight vs. the necessary escape velocity.

You are trying to talk about a planet where there is no chemical combustion known to man that is capable of propelling things up. I ask you to think about the outrageous force of substances like TNT, and then think about the sort of gravitational field where if you put one kilogram of tungsten on top of one kilogram of TNT and blew it up, it would just get super hot and melt into the ground, instead of propelling the tungsten upward. I assure you, it would be a world without trees, and likely without complex organic life as we know it. In fact, with gravity that high, the 'planet' would likely be a superhot mass of dense elements. Again, I do have a degree in physics.

I applaud you for sticking to all this, however. I sincerely advise you to get The Physics of Star Trek, by Laurence M. Krauss. It talks about stuff just like this, and Krauss is a famous professor of physics."

The issues with GameWorks are reported in many more sites that just WCCFTech. A few examples include:

- Nvidia’s GameWorks program usurps power from developers, end-users, and AMD - ExtremeTech
- Crysis 2 tessellation: too much of a good thing? - TechReport
- Is Nvidia Playing Fair With Their New Development Tools? = TechDirt

There's plenty more, but as usual most sites prefer not to directly state an opinion, to avoid distancing themselves from part of their audience. More evidence, you say? How about the fact that the list of games using GameWorks is peppered with some of the most Nvidia-biased games launched recently, including:

- Fallout 4 
- Assassin's Creed: Unity
- Batman: Arkham Knight
- Project Cars
- The Witcher 3
- Crysis 2
- Batman: Arkham Origins
- Watch_Dogs
- World of Warcraft

This is much more than the two games you mention.

Your other comments show a rather significant lack of understanding of graphical processes and of how the GameWorks program works. Tessellation occurs before culling, so even if a surface is obscured the tessellation would impact performance, as demonstrated by the fact that lowering tessellation manually in Crysis 2 alleviates performance. The GameWorks program is meant to be a gray-box API, so even though the programmers are free to use it as they will, its performance is still effectively up to Nvidia to choose.

If you willfully decide not to see the evidence laid in front of you, then I your conclusion that the issue does not exist is laughable. I understand skepticism, but that is a different quality from ignorant stubbornness.

You don't seem to be very literate on the Intel subject, either. Intel is known to be selling its mobile chips for extremely low margins, and further subsidizing to keep the competition out.

If you fail to see that a company that has repeatedly found guilty of anti-competitive practices and had to pay billions of dollars in fines is still up to shady business, I really don't know if this discussion is worth having, since you are clearly incapable of the critical thinking required to maintain it. These fines were punishment for the anti-competitive behavior they engage in. By admitting that these are indeed a punishment, you must also admit that they are guilty of these practices. That is, of course, unless you insist on ignorantly continuing to believe contradicting statements, as you seem to be doing up until now.

">You just aren't winning yet.

And therein lies the problem. Not because we aren't ""winning,"" but that one is so entrenched in cognitive bias that you've set it up as a ""winner-loser"" scenario versus better or worse or right or wrong or truth and falsehood or any sort of scale of merit rather than ego and boastful self-esteem. This isn't a football game, silly goose!

The reality is that the conversation has been dominated by huge special interests, people who only care about their personal hobby, and a sensationalized mainstream media. While the problem still persists, no solution has yet to arrive. Even when we have a surplus of 300 million firearms in this country, it's still not the utopia we've all come to expect from NRA rhetoric. So evidently, something needs fixed. And I'm not saying it resides solely at the feet of gun-control because it by no means does: it resides behind increasing education, social-safety nets, health care, and so on as well.

I only bring confidence and condescension when others bring hostility. Sorry you don't like it, but sometimes one has to fight fire with fire—in conversation—against some people since that's all they know how to do.

">Stop being facetious

I apologize for not taking the realism of an internet spaceship game too seriously. Or taking it too seriously.

> it makes sense that boff abilities are activated.

Where did anyone propose taking that away?

>The best players in this game realize there is an ebb and flow to battle. They don't throw everything AND thd kitchen sink in all at the same time. Honestly, that is just lazy piloting. It takes skill and experience to effectively manage your abilities... just giving everyone an easy out like that is absurd and takes so much out of the game.

I just don't understand the logic here. You acknowledge that you can duplicate autofiring abilities through the pretty terrible kludge of using a spacebar macro. You also say that it sucks and that people who do this are terrible at the game (paraphrasing), so manual activation is superior. You then go on to say that making a spacebar style macro easier for the players and less of a shitty workaround to an awful system makes the game too easy. But you already said you can currently do that and that you won't be any good if you choose to do so, so what is the complaint again?

The issue here is that you haven't really thought about the problem. Why does a spacebar macro exist in the first place? Because you have way too many abilities on your ship to even bind them all, much less use them individually. In order to get the most of your abilities, chaining them through a keybind is used. This bind is the only thing that allows the core builds of Drake, Dragon, and A2B to function in the game. So how does the ""kitchen sink"" macro come from the ""I have to keep my Drake running"" macro? Because you have to mash the same button constantly to get it to do its job! Chance based cooldown reductions, variable cooldowns, cooldown reducing skills, keypress lag, unrecognized keypresses, etc... make it impossible to predict when you will be able to recast the power. So, you end up with one key you have to mash all of the time. And since you're mashing that key all of the time, that takes away from your ability to mash other keys, so you throw more stuff on there until you end up with the kitchen sink.

Adding autofire to abilities would allow you to completely ditch that macro you needed to run your drake and free you from mashing that button. That ALLOWS you to make more sensible binds or use individual activations for more powers because you don't have to mash that key anymore! Autofiring EPtX abilities and A2B and any other abilities that you are planning on casting on cooldown anyways doesn't detract from the gameplay. It streamlines it and makes people less reliant on a one-size-fits-all spacebar macro just to make their ship function. More fun and better players, not less fun and worse players.

">It doesn't make sense though, because a criminal can just buy the parts and fix it beforehand.

So, then we've reduced the group of people capable of inflicting maximum casualties from those who have access to a firearm to those who have access to a firearm AND which have the, money, parts, knowledge, motivation, and time to modify the firearm. You're making the anti-gun argument for them.

It's a bad idea because:

1. It's CA, so all gun control is legislated in bad faith as a strategy for the end result of the elimination or minimization of private firearms ownership.
2. It's just as likely to get the wrong people killed as it is likely to save the right people. Generally speaking, the same things which make a firearm good as at defense make it good at offense (crime) as well.
3. It's unenforceable for reasons including the one you mention above.

It's also important to understand the difference between ""rational"" and ""sound"" in the context of argument/debate/rhetoric. The logic that reducing the number of rounds that can be fired from a gun limits one's ability to go on shooting sprees is clearly rational, as it is the same reason why we prefer larger capacity magazines for our own purposes.

Sometimes that is negotiated down too, such as 5% or 4% or even 1-2% depending on the price/type of property (NNN coop fees are typically 2% to buying side and 2% to selling side). That is how it is structured. And not all states or jurisdictions are 6% to selling side who then splits 3%/3%...many places the buyer's agent gets paid by the buyer almost all the time.

"> Never said that, friend.

Except you did just that when you claimed it wasn't relevant. 

The cost of tuition for public schools has always been increasing since its inception. Therefore your argument that ""tuition (for colleges) has been going up in price for years"" isn't an argument at all in itself.

Lastly, if you've ever actually attended college or university you would know that arguing for lower tuition fees or a tuition freeze happens every year without fail and the move is ""lead"" by student government. But every year without fail the tuition fees continue to climb because as long as you keep accepting the status quo then nothing will change.

Have you actually read what Hillary has proposed? Her ""New College Compact"" requires:

1. Higher taxes on low and middle class
2. The States to pay for it
3. Colleges to freeze tuition

Source

So when Hillary says she'll get individual states to pay for it and colleges to freeze their tuition that's pragmatic yet when Bernie proposes free colleges through taxes on wall street speculation that it's an empty promise.

"This poped up on the front page for me, so I dont post here often, but I don't see how it's wrong.

As a liberal, I notice conservatives always argue from authority.

It's always ""what the founding fathers wanted"" or ""the constitution"" (and even then, not the actual constitution, but their idealized version in which many provisions and interpretations in it don't exist), or ""God said"" or ""according to the Bible"". 

When your entire political perspective is essentially based on a giant mess of arguments from authority, it's not surprising when people get that impression of you. I know not all conservatives are like this, particularly the more socially liberal fiscal conservatives, but it really appears to me that conservative ideology is deeply rooted in tradition, religion, and their distorted views of the good old days.

I don't think they need the guidance of a cop or drill sergeant (although some appear that way), but they definitely do seem to be clueless about morality once you reject their bases of it in the constitution and religion. Which is why so many conservative christians think atheists are totally amoral sociopaths, and why so many conservatives in politics think anything that isn't in line with what the founding fathers wanted is bad.

I think it's possible to grow out of such mindsets, and therefore think that the naturally submissive part is slightly inaccurate, as an ex conservative it's more of a lifelong conditioning thing. While some may outgrow it and break out of it like I did, many more won't....it's too strong and I don't feel like a rational convo is even possible with such a person."

"> Having more options does not necessarily increase depth in a multiplayer game, which is what Sirlin focuses on.

As I already said, I think that Sirlin's insights are generally applicable. More options does not necessarily increase depth in a single-player game, either. Sid Meier describes a game as a set of interesting decisions; if those decisions favor some options over others, then they become less interesting. 

> With that in mind, having more options is rarely a bad thing, because they afford the player more flexibility in how he wants to play the game.

That's abdicating responsibility. Yes, the player can choose between different options; but it's the responsibility of the developer to make sure that the choice between those options is interesting and fun. The choice to Pair Up or not to Pair Up is uninteresting in Awakening; it is interesting in Fates. I would argue that therefore, Awakening would be better off without Pair Up.

In addition, I don't think you really believe this statement or have considered it. For example, when deploying units in Fire Emblem you typically have about thirty units to choose between. Would that choice be more interesting if there were three hundred units? Or thirty thousand units? Obviously, since developers are restrained in terms of resources, things rarely get into that territory, but there is no reason to be biased in one direction over another.

> If an option is too weak, that is wasted design for multiplayer because no-one will use it. In single-player, the player might choose to use it exactly because it is weak and he wants the challenge.

I agree that there's some value in having weak options for the sake of creating a challenge. But the entire point of creating a challenge is to force oneself to optimize in other areas and to make decisions between other options more interesting, or at least to force us to re-evaluate them (for example, trying to beat the game in a low number of turns forces us to use units that require less experience to perform well, to use rescue chains, to use warp staves). That is to say that weak options are still bad within the confines of that challenge. The choice between Seth and Amelia is no less easy when I have decided to restrict myself from using flying units, and the existence of Amelia as a deployment option therefore still adds no depth. And indeed, the set of circumstances in which the existence of Amelia adds depth is extremely limited. 

> If an option is too strong, that is bad for multiplayer because it makes the game too boring, i.e. not enough viable options. In single-player, it may also make the game too boring, but if the player can get by without using it, that's not too much of an issue. The player may also choose to avoid using that option precisely because it is too strong (e.g. Seth).

Yes, the player may choose to ignore that option, but it is not up to the player to ignore the design mistakes of the developer, it is up to the developer to not make design mistakes in the first place.

> For example, grinding makes any RPG (including FE) easy, but nobody complains about it unless they have to grind in order to stand a chance to beat the enemies in the game. See: The 7th Saga. That is an example of not having enough options in a single-player game: when there is only one realistic option to proceed. Seth is an exception to this because even though he's broken, the player is not forced to use him, and can still beat the game without his help.

I agree that it is possible to have too few options, but that does not follow that we should always be biased in favor of more options over fewer options. Chess offers far fewer options that most modern video games, and it's still an incredibly deep game even for people who have played it their entire lives."

"I've been waiting for so long to tell this story. So I'm a server at Red Robin and I once served a teenage couple probably around 17 or 18 (easily seniors in high school).

I had been standing from a distance keeping an eye on my tables when suddenly I see this happening and watch the girl's face just turn from happiness to just absolute horror. Tears well up and she started banging her fists on the table screaming out at him that he's an asshole and what not.

Everyone in the restaurant can hear it and everything just stops. As she's becoming more and more volatile, he's trying to calm her down. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Even my manager had come out and looked at me as if we both didn't know how to handle this. Finally, the guy yells, ""FINE. FINE. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CIVIL THEN I'LL GO."" She begs him to stay, but he pries himself away and beelines for the door. She doesn't follow him. 

He passes me on the way to the door, stops, and walks back towards me. He hands me 50 dollars and says, ""You can already obviously see why I did what I did. I just apologize that you had to deal with this here and now. Take care of her, and make sure she's okay"". He then leaves.

That has to be the dumbest thing I have ever heard. She can't carry because a kid might see it and think its candy? The 'Flash Bang' type holster goes on the underside of the bra and rides center line at the bottom of the rib cage.

"I'm not arguing tangentially to your assertion. This is the incorrect layman understanding of how crime psychology works. It might be called the purpose of the punishments, but it not affective like that. It exists as part of our law because people who do not study psychology or criminology vote on our bills. 

Here is the point, you can find any rationalization you want to not read up on modern criminology theory. You can remain in your false understanding of how flawed this idea of criminal prevention does not work in the way you say it does. You can continue to assume that the world would spiral into chaos if there weren't minimum punishments to deter crimes. The fact of the matter is good behaviourist science shows this not to be the case. In fact this mentality about crime and the way to treat criminals actually makes criminals more likely to remain criminals and become even more violent criminals. So I urge you again read the morass of theory on crime and stop spewing your wives tales about crime. I didn't comment for some reason of being right, but to inform you that this is a dangerous and incorrect way of thinking. I offered you simple advice to read up strong and empirically proven science and you returned with bullshit conjecture. Just because you think this is the way the world works, and it operates within a coherent rational structure does not make it the case. Your idea about crime as I tried to tell you at the beginning is based of the enlightenment paradigm of humans as purely rational beings. The simple fact of the matter is we are not as rational as you describe humans to be. 

""but there's a wide, wide field of people who are discouraged by the risk, even if only long enough to calm down.""

This assertion right here I would like you to find me a journal article after the 1950's that says this, because you wont. The simple fact of the matter is people who are going to steal do not factor length of criminal punishment into whether or not they should commit a crime but into how violently they will avoid being caught. So please continue to consider your psychological ""resentement"" as to why you do not steal when you get the urge to as a real world phenomenon.

"Do you have to ask the McDonald's employee how much an ice cream cone costs to decide whether or not to buy it? Do you compare the price of different gums to decide which gum to buy? You can make the assumption that it's priced low enough that people will buy it, so you look for what you want without really considering price too much. You don't need to ask the price because you are certain you can afford it, and it's the flavor you want, even if the gum you want is 2-3x the price of the other gums available. If the price of an ice cream cone or gum is a significant factor in deciding whether or not you will buy it, you are probably better off just not buying it.

You are seriously overestimating how much $40k is to a big business. I see 2-3 million if dollars worth of product move through my department at work every day, $40k is barely a blip on the radar. We're not even the biggest department in the building, there's $15-20 million dollars worth of product that leaves our factory every day. If the company I work for were to buy a 3D printer they would look for the printer that best fits their needs and as long as it isn't drastically overpriced (which is extremely rare because the other company needs to sell the a bunch of that product to stay afloat, so it is almost guaranteed to be reasonably priced) that would be the one they would buy. 

Price is only one factor when buying something, it's importance varies drastically for each purchase. For things that are going to be purchased in very large quantities (a component that goes into a product) the price is really important because a 1 cent price difference means several million dollars per year. But for something like a big ass 3D printer that's likely going last several years and pay for itself in that time, cost is a much smaller part of the equation.

>Why would you take issue with someone having different religious beliefs from you

This is a Christian subreddit so the theology discussed here is of Christian theology. What I said about homosexuality was based on scripture and my understanding of the Bible. 

>Pork

The pork argument is invalid because God told Peter all is clean. Also a hypothetical argument like that just doesn't hold any weight.

>Eternal word in the Bible

You fundamentally misunderstand the Bible and I would recommend you look into that. Very briefly, not every word and teaching in the Bible is meant to be applicable today. Society does change, so certain practices, as long as they are not immoral, are now acceptable in comparison to how things were in the Bible. The best way I can explain this using text is Paul writing about slaves. (which also addresses your random and irrelevant slave comment). When Paul tells slaves to obey their masters, he is not saying that Christians should own slaves 2000 years later. He is teaching in a time when slavery is acceptable, and so he addresses it in that context. Same with women. Jesus showed himself to be very equal towards women and some of his closest companions and most feverent followers were women. This is because Jesus didn't necessarily abide by the social norms of the time. Don't take that the wrong way though, because Jesus still abided by the moral law God had set, and he still remained solid in the moral teachings in the old testament. He just added love and forgiveness instead of punishment, for reasons it would take an entire other post to address.

Basically, just understand that society and practices change, but the Bible was written in context for the times, so some of the practices that were purely cultural and not moral were different. 

And finally, just another sort of random point you keep bringing up, food. Many scholars now believe that God told the Israelites not to eat certain foods because there were dietary and health reasons not to, such as bottom feeding fish. Many scholars believe God said not to eat these because they contained harmful bacteria. Just something else to research.

To end, please stop taking this so personally, and please stop veering off path into other theology that has nothing to do with homosexuality, the topic on hand. Also read more on the Bible, and more about why Jesus changed things, instead of going off the generally ignorant reasoning you may encounter elsewhere. "

"> I am saying that your view is a very hopeless way of looking at things and bad advice to anyone who is at risk of being raped.

No, it's a very realistic way of looking at things. And it's not bad advice at all. ""Anyone who is at risk of being raped""? You do realize that that is every single person, right? A majority of rapes are committed by people the victim knows and trusts to a certain degree. All those measures help exactly nothing in those situations. You're hardly going to go on a date wearing high tech panties, are you? Or to work. Or to a study group. Most rapes happen in the victims apartment. Know a lot of people who would wear those at home? I don't.

> They need to worry about protecting themselves.

Only that none of those measures work. Seriously, have you actually spent some time researching the topic of rape? Because you seem to know exactly nothing about it.

> Another flaw with your logic is that is doesn't consider the fact that if everyone took certain countermeasures then rapists would have more failures and fewer people would get raped over time.

Wrong! Because the measures don't work! Which anybody knows who has actually researched this topic. And you are doing some serious harm by perpetuating the myth that you can protect yourself from rape.

> The research you are referring to says otherwise

No, it really doesn't. First of all, of course repeat offenders find their victims in their own circles. Where else? In a dark alley? Oh please.

Second of all, like I already said somewhere else in this thread, most rapists know what they are doing is wrong, but they'll only admit to it as long as you don't use the word rape. There is no mixed message, it's all one consistent message.

> Either way, it shows that they aren't likely to be educated into not being rapists.

Not really. You are forgetting that most rapists think what they are doing is normal and that pretty much everybody does it, which gives them a stamp of approval in their mind. If our society made it impossible for them to believe that by consistently demonstrating contempt for any form of sexual violence, things would change. Things would also change if girls were brought up to be less submissive and selfless but instead with more agency and self worth, because that would make them a lot harder to be coerced, which is btw a part of pretty much every rape.

> It suggests that the focus should be on incarceration and teaching people how to protect themselves.

No, it doesn't. Because you cannot protect yourself from rape. That is a myth. Seriously, how is that supposed to work???

Edited to add: The solution is to get rid of rape culture. Why? Rape culture allows rapists to believe what they are doing is normal, it prevents victims from coming forward, it often prevents the police and prosecution from doing their job when victims do come forward by having way more doubt regarding the victim's story than is justified. Rape culture has also, in the minds of most people, turned rape into a crime that only horrific monsters who are practically foaming at the mouth commit, which makes it hard for pretty much everybody to believe that Joe Normal is a rapist (even though most rapists are Joe Normals). The reason for that last issue is that our society silences rape victims, so we never hear the stories about how Joe Normal raped someone. You will never, ever significantly lower the number of rapes unless you get rid of rape culture, because it causes all those things that make life easy for rapists."

>What does abortion have to do with the first amendment and religion?

The two are linked because the writer was counting on you to fill in some blanks in his hurried response. But here is the long form: 

Speech, such as burning flags, saying that God is a racist cunt who cares more about what people do with their genitals than actually loving one another, and not having to invoke the name of some prepubescent's ideal of a father figure every time they pledge allegiance to their country would be examples of freedom of religion and freedom of speech.

The argument OP is making is that Christian's try to legislate that everyone behave the way they interpret an desert dweller's storybook tells them to. And that is bad, because religions are idiots who make bad decisions for their people and other people. 

But you should be able to believe what you want. And that is the beauty of it all. If you think that God has a wonderful plan that runs on dead babies and raping people, awesome! But I get to believe that such an idea is awful and we shouldn't support such a god.

But what about those poor bakers who are forced to make gay cakes?

What about those poor restaurateurs who were forced to serve blacks? 

You can have whatever religious beliefs that you want, but not enforce them on the public. Muslims can't make people not eat bacon. Christian's can't slap science texts from people's hands. You can't refuse service to someone just because you don't like them or they make you uncomfortable or you dug around in a badly written book full of terrible fairy tales and found one line that supports your secret fear that you might want a big juicy dick in your mouth and use it to attack people who want to plan a fucking wedding.

We have antidiscrimination laws because discrimination is unjust and it hurts people. 

What about abortion? How is that a first amendment right?

Well, it probably wouldn't be if Christians hadn't freaked out over it so much. But when you take something like someone's genitals and then make it impossible to educate young people in the responsible use of those genitals and then want them to undergo something that has long lasting, negative effects on them because you didn't want the teacher to explain how penises and vaginas and uteri work, then it kind of does become a first amendment thing. 

Because actions speak louder than words. Rapists shouldn't be able to cripple someone for the rest of their lives. Women should be able to scrape a few cells off their uterus if they want to.

But if what you want is fewer abortions, teach better sexual education. Just like if you want fewer car accidents... well, you get the idea.

If Christians want to follow Jesus' word and love one another as they would be loved, try being compassionate and put yourself in other people's shoes, and stop trying to tell everyone what to do with their dick, I don't think the left would have a problem with churches.

Christianity is seen as a competitor because it keeps competing against people trying to live their lives and educate people. Global warming, sexual education, how old the earth is, what being gay is, how to handle end of life decisions with loved ones, boom, there the church is, interfering where it doesn't belong.

The left didn't go out and attack the church, the church jumped in the middle of the road and tried to tell everyone how to behave and then cries because it got hit. Oh, boo hoo, a couple of bakers have to write ""Tom and Steve"" on a cake? Where is your outrage about Christian gay-conversion camps, or young earth idiots filling kids with jackass ideas?

The left is a religion? Yeah, if that religion's rules are be nice to each other and get the fuck out of my pants.

"Discussion is good to have when there is something new to say, and where there is some common ground as a starting point. However, not only is there not much more to be said in the religion/atheist controversy, the reason it remains a controversy is because there are no common assumptions. How effective is pointing out lack of evidence to people for whom evidence is unnecessary?

We make lots of sacrifices for our marriages. The sense of enjoyment you get out of debating religion could be one of them. You might not see it as a problem, but your wife does, and so do your mutual friends. To these people, you're ""that guy"" who likes to talk about religion the same way some people are obsessed with talking about politics. It's not a ""disservice"" to avoid discussions about some topics depending on social context. To be blunt, from your description, you don't appear to be effective in your attempts to engage them in discussion anyway. That's the reality, regardless of whether you think they should be more open-minded. Maybe you're not the right person to advocate on behalf of atheism, and should set aside those high-brow intellectual discussions and just focus on the far more important task of strengthening your marriage.

Church is a place where your wife might find someone who shares with her a spiritual connection she doesn't have with you. That's the temptation. I will also point out that if you tag along and at least appear to be open-minded, you might steer her to a more normal church, one that doesn't use religion as an excuse to drive a wedge between a man and his wife.

If your wife tolerates your atheism, agrees to vaccinate the kids and lets them learn about evolution, that's good enough. Accompany her to church and refrain from discussions about religion. In the Orthodox Church wedding rite, crowns of martyrdom are placed on the couple's heads. The underlying truth remains even if we remove the ""religious gloss"" -- that marriage requires sacrifice."

It is a trope among people who loathe and fear Islam that their fear and loathing has nothing in common with racism because Islam is not a race, the implication being that hating Muslims is rational and wise whereas hating black people is deeply irrational and stupid.

> Some people who claim that Islam is profoundly evil will also say that they bear Muslims no ill will but I don’t think they are telling the truth. It is really difficult and indeed psychologically unnatural to claim that you hate an ideology without hating the people in whose lives it is expressed. Religions, nations, and even races are all shared imaginative constructs (although nations and races have other characteristics as well) and if you really want to extirpate them, you must extirpate the people who imagine them as well.

> The claim that Islam isn’t a race and so it is entirely rational to hate and fear it gains its moral force from the implicit claim that there is something uniquely horrible about racial hatred.

A common defense used by those making prejudice statements regarding Muslims has been to claim that 'Islam is not a race', this doesn't fly with comedian Ben McLeay who says that, besides it being weird that they think that their 'mis-categorisation' is a defense excusing their bigotry, it actually doesn't make them any less racist.

> If I had a dollar for everyone someone has told me “Islam isn’t a race” in the last week, I probably wouldn’t currently be two months behind on my internet bill. Delivered every single time by someone confident that they’re the first person to ever say it to me, it’s a sentence invariably used to argue that someone’s anti-Muslim sentiment isn’t the product of racism, and therefore totally fine.

> The worst people alive are crawling out of the woodwork to comment exactly this sentence on every single article about Sonia Kruger and Pauline Hanson they can find, hoping that people will stop mistaking their hate speech for dangerous racism and instead acknowledge it as run-of-the-mill, harmless religious discrimination.

> Islam is estimated to constitute a full 45% of the population of Africa, and our dear friends to the north, Indonesia, have the largest Muslim population of any country in the world. As you can see, Islam is an incredibly diverse religion.

> “Ah, you’ve made my point! You’ve been defeated by your own logic!” I hear you type angrily into the comments section. Well, no actually, I’ve made mine. What does ISIS ( the Islamic State Of Iraq and Syria) have to do with a schoolteacher in Indonesia? Absolutely nothing.

> This is what we call “coded” racism. Using a term that doesn’t quuuiiiiite get at the meat of the fucked thing you’re really saying. In a time when we were getting better at not being dicks about gay people, dickheads were making fun of people for being “metrosexual” as a neat way of not making fun of them for 'dressing like a poof'. In the US, the term “thug” is used a lot by conservative talking heads as a way of vilifying young black men.

> These people might be saying that it’s Muslims they want to stop from immigrating to Australia, but they’re not talking about the schoolteacher from Indonesia or the doctor from Uzbekistan, they are talking about people that, let’s not mince words here, look like Osama bin Laden.

> If somehow everything went to shit and these complete winguses got into power, they wouldn’t be searching white people at the airport to see if they’re carrying a Quran, they wouldn’t be measuring the beards of visiting Swedes, they would be stopping everyone of Middle Eastern appearance they saw.

>I am 27 years old

Hah, I knew you were still a kid. I had similar beliefs to you at your age. Keep on seeking truth do not close your mind to other belief systems, search for God but don't be afraid of where it takes you. I'd suggest reading some books on near death experiences. They are fascinating and real evidence that an afterlife exists, just not the christian version although some people recall seeing a ""Jesus"" like figure there. Most people come back saying the same thing: ""There is only love, God does not judge, you judge yourself. Reicarnation is real. And the most interesting thing I've heard numerous times which is quite profound, ""there are agnostics in heaven"".

>Because God will, I believe, give everyone sufficient opportunity to make the correct decision.

This is I believe the most dangerous belief that you hold, even worse than your strange and arbitrary prejudice against gays, because with this one belief you excuse God for doing what you know is unimaginable: tossing people in hell just because they came up with the wrong beliefs, because as long as you stick to the line ""God will give everyone sufficient opportunity to see the truth"", your God cannot be evil. The sad truth is this is nonsense. I was raised christian, I was a Jesus freak most of my life. I renounced christianity long ago not because I want an easier belief system, but because christianity made absolutely no logical sense to me for so very many reasons. Removing myself from my christian faith was very dificult and painful, it took years of introspection and research and... well, pain. Now you tell me God is going to punish me ETERNALLY after I've already been through hell sorting out my spiritual beliefs. 

>How do you know their motives?

I'm not sure you're being honest with me here. I know my motives for one, and I have seriously and desperately been searching and learning and my beliefs continue to evolve. Besides that, you can't tell me that there are two people out there who have exactly the same pure motives, to know God, but that have come to completely opposite ideas about God. You refuse to believe this because then you'd have to admit that God really isn't playing fair, he's just arbitrarily letting some people into heaven for believing in one religion even though as we know, reasonably people may have a different religion. But no, they go to hel FOREVER. I picture God watching the torture with a malevolent grin on his face. I mean, he can't have much compassion since he could end their suffering in a split second... oh wait no he can't, you believe God is bound to some other force out there. I seriously look forward to you finding out what God is bound by.

Ok here's my last ditch effort to get you to see that the version of God you believe in is incorrect: A man rapes and murders and young single mother of 3. Goes to jail and repents, gets out of jail and dies and goes to heaven. His victim, a 21 year old young woman, who grew up poor but jewish let's say, goes to hell for ETERNITY! Is that justice? Or forget words like that because we do not agree on their meaning. Is that right? How can you reconcile that with any version of love that we know?

But YOU can't. I've known 30+ girls with the ultra-short pixie (lived in a hipster city for a while). At best, they lost a full point of 0-10 attractiveness -- at worst, they looked like shit. The worst part is that everyone told them how brave and pretty they looked: ""You go girl!"" 
And this may be why. So they all wore the do for enough time to realize they weren't getting dates with attractive guys and then quietly grew it out.

I can think of one, maybe two, girls I know who still looked truly hot with short hair. They were both athletes with smoking hot bodies (under a hundred pounds), the faces of models (with the slight jaw and high cheekbones to pull it off), and eighteen years old. If you're all three of the above ask a stylist if they really think a pixie, or even a bob will look hot on you. Tell them you'll pay for some kind of haircut either way. Don't ask girl friends, coworkers, guys who want your approval -- or anyone. Ask a professional.

While ignoring the following questions because they force to you admit something you probably don't want to admit - either you apparently don't care about crime (you only care about guns, which is why you fixate explicitly on gun crimes), or you apparently believe that crimes committed with guns are worse than crimes committed by other means.

I also like how you wholly ignore defensive gun use.
>Wow. Absolutely everything can contribute to lowering gun violence. Except gun control. Because reasons. /s

It's more that, there are more factors at work in violence and we have PROVEN CAUSALITY for some factors while guns->violent crimes isn't even correlated, much less proven - so why the fuck are you wasting political capital and effort targeting the method, which IS NOT A CONFIRMED CAUSAL FACTOR instead of the proven causes of these crimes?

If you ban some of the guns (because a total ban is explicitly unconstitutional and will not pass unless you manage to repeal the Second Amendment first), you MIGHT see a reduction in total violent crimes. Emphasis on might. You will probably see a reduction in gun crimes, but that DOES NOT mean that will translate to a reduction in total violent crimes and there is very little solid data to support such a claim.

On the other hand, if you introduce legislation to target ANY of those non-gun factors I mentioned above, you WILL see a reduction in total violent crime rates - WHICH INCLUDES GUN CRIMES - because they are a causal factor in violent crime rates.

Political capital and willpower is not infinite in a democracy. You cannot both ban the guns and tackle our fucked up private prison system and implement universal healthcare in whatever form and tackle income inequality and begin taking steps to end the war on drugs and make our public schools less shit and beat seven kinds of hell out of predatory student loan lenders so that people can actually afford to pursue post-secondary education without turning themselves into wage slaves for 20 years thereafter.

We have irrefutable proof of the political cost of pursuing policies like gun bans in this country AND we have peer-reviewed and verified data of the inefficacy of those bans. And yet you STILL persist in trying to push these bans instead of ANYTHING ELSE that would be GUARANTEED to not only affect our violent crime rates (which includes gun crimes!) but also have positive effects elsewhere in our country?

This is why no one outside of your fucking echo chamber, no one that has given five fucking minutes of actual thought and research into this issue, takes you people seriously.

"TIL that reddit doesn't know that Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism are not religions. They are ethical systems of conduct, not worship.

If anything, each one is more of a psychology on how to live a balanced life than a religion. 

Religion is defined as: the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, esp. a personal God or gods.

How do any of the aforementioned philosophies fit that definition? 

The Tao is not a force to worship, but a force to understand. It's something to be aware of and recognize in order to help you live a better life.

Same with Buddhism. The major tenants of it propose that people recognize their suffering and what causes it--usually, some sort of attachment to objects, feelings, etc.

Confucianism is nothing more than Aesop's tales in an Asian style. 

Again, all of these are ideologies of living a good life. Which, imo, has nothing to do with religion because it's not dependent on anything outside of one's self.

Would you say that people don't believe in the Big Bang, then? Whether or not it has the ascribed status of a theory or a matter of faith, it still represents a matter of some faith if you express belief in it. Within the lab, it is just an unproven theory-- in pop culture, it can be something larger. 

>You seem to know a lot about the intents and motivations of people you don't even know.

People aren't as individualistic and unique as they pretend to be. When you have a widespread interfaith phenomena like evangelism, it's more likely to represent a common aspect of the human psyche than being a coincidental shared personal quest. 

>Do tell. What is the ""dogma"" of atheists? Is it documented somwhere? Is there some definitive guide?

There are shades of centrality in atheism, much of it centered around the writings of Darwin, Sagan, and Dawkins. Dawkins is probably the closest thing popular atheist culture has to a pope. His writings are squarely evangelical. 

>You have yet to establish the ""religion"" of atheists.

In most cases, they probably subscribe to a dogmatically materialist view of reality-- that all things that are real must be personally apparent and manifest physically. Although modern scientific culture (real science has no certainty) lauds this belief as the most plausible, it's still quite dogmatic and requires a degree of faith in the secular foundations of academia. 

>So far it has something to do with evangelizing even though it should be clear by now that evangelizism is not a primary component of religion nor is it even a good indicator. I can name a dozen things off hand that people evangelize, but wouldn't even come close to being religious in nature.

If people are ""evangelizing"" something, then they are employed in a religious behavior, even if they're talking about something consumer-oriented-- like Apple products. If they're evangelizing a higher truth or reality that is outside human understanding (like whether or not there is a higher power), then it's distinctly religious evangelism. If atheism was merely a function of doubt, then there would be no evangelism. It wouldn't even operate as a group or subculture. 

>Maybe it would. So what? If they don't believe in deities or spirits and don't perform rituals in an organized manner, I have no problem excluding them as religions. We have other classifications.

It sounds like you're going a long way to exclude your beliefs from the idea of religion. Are you sure this has as much to do with definition as it does with the way your subculture has characterized religion? 

>You can view it however you want. I just don't think you're going to make many meaningful arguments coming from that position. Why don't we just call every philosophy a religion? Why stop at materialism? Why not call economic conservatism a religion? Why not call pro-choice a religion? Where does it stop?

Materialism is a comprehensive and emotionally driven philosophy that defines post 19th century culture. It's too large, disruptive, and regimented to be seen as a simple idea. It has changed every facet of how human beings view themselves, nature, and humanity as a whole. It's too deep, broad, and intimate a belief to be called anything but a religion. If you can't see connections between modern consumerism and idolatry, then you lack either historical reference or social consciousness. "

">them doing stupid shit is better than them not doing anything at all.

No, it's literally not. For example, if they're lifting weights in a range that stimulates no physical adaptation that they're looking for (anything in the weight range where they could easily knock out a 20-rep set will produce endurance adaptations, which if used for aerobic exercises will burn calories at an ever decreasing rate [meaning you have to do more and more to get the same results, which are already measly], but they won't know that. So, while they're busy putting in work (mental effort/ mental accounting for energy expenditure not being an accurate representation of actual energy expended or actual work contributed towards desired results), they're going to get nothing out of it. They're not going to get the results they want and eventually they're going to quit. So, no, it really is much worse than doing nothing at all. This gives the illusion of effectiveness. At least when you're not doing anything at all, you know you're not doing anything about your health. 

>at least they have the courage to try, which is far more than the rest of the population.

No gold stars for doing better than mediocre. No gold stars for taking care of the responsibilities you're supposed to be taking care of, even if everyone else isn't. Do what you're supposed to do because you're supposed to do it. What everyone else is doing or failing to do is irrelevant.

"Alright everyone, I'm that guy. I'll edit the blog post in a second to prove it, but I would like to address any and all issues here.

I realize my tone on the blog was very negative towards artists, but I would like to say that I fully appreciate all the work they do. Most of you will disagree, but I believe I am actually being helpful to artists. I'm not forcing anyone to work for me, and I'm letting artists set their own prices. I'm not trying to scam them into accepting a lower offer than what they want.

Most artists usually work with very little to no pay at all, but I'm giving unknown artists a chance to have their artwork shown to millions of people along with pay. I give all artists I work with a link in the game to their portfolio along with co-authoring them on any sites that allow for co-authoring. I also take on a risk that the game may flop, the last two games I developed ended up making almost nothing while I spent over $600 on the art between the games. If I had split revenues with the artists they would've made less.

Just so you know I'm only 16 years old myself. I'm going to edit the blog to post to be more considerate of artists, but all artists who I've worked with (that haven't screwed me over) would tell you they're very happy.

"Ohhh, I get it. You're one of those people that felt that $15 for an e-book for a novel that just came out was some sort of insult when the initial retail price of hardcover is $28. 

Please, please, please know that the cost of printing the book is actually a relatively small part of the price maybe %10 or so. The distribution of physical books versus e-books is a bit trickier. As there's hosting, the costs involved in getting the text readable in the wide array of reader formats out there, and so on. And those DRMs that you hate probably wouldn't have been even necessary if people didn't feel like distributing other people's hard work for free.

The pricing of a book just isn't as simple as you might think it is. Usually it's set up so that the publisher as a business can actually turn a profit. And profit = the ability for a publisher to take some risks and publish new books.

If the pricing bugs you that much for the e-book, just wait until the paperback comes out, you'll see the e-book version follow suit with a reduction in price."
"Honestly I don't even like saying left and right wings because of how stupid the concept looks after you start talking about what is and what is right or left wing. The whole thing only works in a country by country basis. Every political compass says that Communists are far left, but other than that, they all disagree with each other. So yes, I would agree that ISIS shouldn't be categorized like that, but I used them as an example because by US standards they'd be considered right wing if they were Christians from Montana fucking people up.

When your average American thinks of right and left wing, they discount economics almost entirely. The right consists of religious and moral conservatives and social liberals. They then associate far left with communism and far right with nazism, discounting how similar the economic systems of each two are. Something you'll notice a lot is that people always seem to include communism and say it's only an economic system, despite how the rest of the political spectrum, in their minds, is only based on race, religion, and nationality. Either way, under this train of thought, ISIS would be right wing. Shit, they're the original right wing, being feudal monarchists.

Now if you divorce social values on race, religion, and nationality completely from the political chart like this, you get shit like Italian Fascists being authoritarian right, German Nazis being authoritarian left, neo-liberals being smack dab in the middle of the right wing, and anarchists all over the damn place. The only ""true"" far right in this sense would be a meritocratic dictatorship like Pinochet and some sort of anarcho-capitalist or anarcho-primitivist(which kind of defies categorization) deal. This is how I would prefer to categorize things, since economics are much more cut and dry in what they are and aren't, whereas social values are much more open to interpretation. 

Explaining what capitalism, feudalism, communism, socialism, corporatism, etc are and how they all are supposed to work is much easier than explaining how hating black people is right wing yet you can still hate white people and be a communist. It also avoids shit like National Bolshevism or Strasserism from turning the entire system on it's head.

Now the origins of how the political compass got the way it is makes the changes and nonsensical bits make more sense. Originally, the left was socially liberal(for the time) capitalists that opposed the traditionalist kings, churchmen, and mercantilists. Then the communists came on and said that they were even more left than the capitalists, and then the capitalists moved to the right because feudalists and mercantilists basically died out, and since the right wing was associated with old timey moral values, that just got mixed up with capitalism somehow. It doesn't really apply at all to our modern political spectrum and should really be dropped, even though there's history to how we got here."

"If your goal was to address misconceptions your analysis should have talked about differences in threat assessment (the biggest misconception regarding this issue among the American lower class). 

You make assumptions at the start of your argument and never defend them, nor do you talk about an opposing view. Why are all these European countries not increasing their spending? Are they not afraid enough? What reasons do European defense ministers offer for their inability or unwillingness to adhere to a certain percentage of gdp? How did we arrive at this arbitrary number in the first place?

IN your conclusion you again state that you believe that the US is spending more because European nations spend less. Why? You didn't challenge or defend it anywhere. By what mechanism are these two things tied to eachother?

Would an increase in European spending mean a decrease in American spending? If so, why and by what mechanism?

Also, restaurants want to get people in and out as quick as possible so they can get as many customers through the doors as they can.

In general, American customer service is amazing, especially compared to what I've experienced elsewhere in the world. But it's amazing in large part because it's fake. Obviously your waitress doesn't actually give a shit about you, she's being nice because she is paid to be. Sometimes we go very overboard with it, and I personally don't feel like I need my waiter to come over and check on me every 15 minutes. But on the other hand, it's nice to always have your water refilled, never have to leave the table to track down the waiter to ask for ketchup and be able to order basically as soon as you're ready.

">Sure, some philosophers don't. But, get this, philosophers who don't have problems with basic concepts actually do accept that definition.

I responded to your claim that - ""The definition for atheism as is used by philosophers is pretty much the same as ""we"" do over here."" 

This is a debate, just as you shouldn't be expected to accept my opinion without supporting evidence, I shouldn't be expected to accept your assertion that philosophers use the lacking belief definition without some evidence to support it. 

And the evidence you supplied in your last post - a link to an IEP article - rather than supporting your claim, shows you're wrong about this. To quote from the article -

>""It has come to be widely accepted that to be an atheist is to affirm the non-existence of God."" 

They specifically say ""it has come to be widely accepted"". The IEP does then mention the lacking belief as negative atheism, but only to specifically distinguish it from the positive atheism definition they will use. 

Here is the definition they use -

>Atheism is the view that there is no God. 

So philosophers don't use the same definition we use here.

>Those are what appear to be the reasoning [ignoring what they don't want to hear, or scaring people into submission] 

It may appear that way to you, but sometimes what initially appears to us to be true, turns out to be based on a misunderstanding. They are not the reasons philosophers would reject it. 

>Even in the post you linked, the person cites sources that define atheism as the lack of belief in a god or gods to ""support"" their argument, Clearly that person is ignoring/dismissing the parts of the definition that they do not like.

No they're not. They're supporting their point that lacking belief isn't widely accepted and isn't the definition philosophers use. They say - "" [IEP] explicitly notes the distinction between this so-called ""positive atheism"" and the broader ""negative atheism"" so as to clearly note that the sense which is widely accepted and which they will use is the narrower ""positive atheism"" 


>If someone says that the term ""atheist"" meaning ""one who does not believe in a god or gods"" is too confusing for them, 

The objection isn't that ""people"" are confused by the definition, it's that the definition ""confuses the issues"". 

>For instance, if they think that atheist is too confusing because it contains within it, two possible positions (one who believes that there are no gods and one who lacks a belief in a god or gods), 

This isn't the objection though. The two possible positions it confuses are atheism and agnosticism. Using the lack of belief definition means it's not possible to distinguish between them. It also necessitates eliminating agnostic as a distinct position. Because agnostics lack belief in God they're now called atheists. But this isn't an accurate description of their position because they also lack belief in no-God. Since agnostic is a substantial and important position on the question, this feature makes the definitions unacceptable. 


>So yeah, they ignore the bits that don't support their ignorant narrative, and then pretend that it's philosophy instead of just plain and simple dishonesty.

You're being very uncharitable in your reading of that post and to the opposing view generally. It's quite insulting to call someone you disagree with dishonest and ignorant. They didn't ignore bit's that don't support their view. They were responding to particular myths and addressing them directly. 

They were rebutting claims made by some atheists that this lacking belief definition is the only correct definition. The title specifically says - ""First myth - ""That 'atheism' refers to the absence of a belief that God exists is just the correct definition of the word, as anyone who studies the issue would know..""

Maybe consider the possibility you could be mistaken about this and read the post with that in mind.

If you want to see some impressive examples about impressive traits that can be bred into dogs, checkout the Kangal, linked above. Do you think there is any ability possibility you could teach a Chihuahua to guard a sheep and take down wolfs? why not? 

""Yeah I read about those untrained spontaneous herding dogs with no training. /s"" - If you think Pavlov's research showed that dogs are all born with the same mentality then I really doubt you can read at all. His work was about conditioning to adopt new traits, not about all dogs being born with the same traits. 

My argument isn't even that pi-bulls are inherently bad, it's just that when they are bad, they are the strongest, toughest most agile and persistent dogs there are that have proven themselves capable of killing humans time and time again. But i know you'll just respond with, but can they scientifically prove every fatal attack was a pit-bull as research has shown that some people incorrectly identify dog breeds.

If you knew anything about pit-bulls you would know what they were bred for. 

All domestic dog breeds have been bred from wild wolves over the last couple of thousand years. A wolfs primary basic instinct is a hunting pack dog. If you think that all dogs are born the same and are taught to be bad. would you go pat a wild wolf since its only humans that make their dogs bad? A wolf is just a breed of dog at the end of the day.

At the end of the day, even if every dog has exactly the same temperament, exactly the same mental stamina and aggression. There are only a few breeds with the ability to kill a human.

"They acknowledged each others existence, he just didn't speak to her. Do you think those who refuse to speak in protest or for religious reasons are being abusive to those around them? Both of them wanted the silence to end. It's extremely obvious to anyone who has any experience with it that the guy has severe anxiety and didn't talk to his wife for fear of what might happen. 

For many people with social anxiety the idea of maintaining the status quo is much more attractive than the potential consequences interaction. Again I'll say you've obviously never experienced living with someone with severe social anxiety. Many times there is very little difference between not speaking with them and speaking with them. The wife goes out of her way to say that when they first got married they had to go to the park to talk. The man couldn't even talk to a video of his wife. 

To make either party in this a villain is so astoundingly stupid I don't know where to start. It's a tragedy, obviously, but not one either party did maliciously.

I'm well aware, There are plenty of signs in this video that she is not ""normalizing her abuse"". Especially given that her children speak highly of both of them. The last time I heard someone speak highly of abusive parents was never.

You don't seem even the slightest bit knowledgeable about social anxiety or the culture surrounding mental illness in Japan. Especially since you dismissed this obvious disease as ""immaturity"", Maybe if you spent less time assuming the man did this out of spite you might be able to see that he obviously has some severe issues to work out. The man couldn't even look at the interviewer, his own children, or his wife. His body language and demeanor just reek of someone who can't even handle light small talk, let alone the idea of breaking a long multi-year silence to a person who could easily tell him to fuck off and leave him for what he's done. 

> I don't see how you could assume the wife was not affected by being completely ignored by someone she lived with for years.

Yeah when you know there is something significantly wrong with someone mentally you make do. I've gone weeks without speaking to a sibling because of their anxiety, you just chalk it up to that and let them get over it at their own pace. In an extreme situation like this it would be easy to let weeks bleed into months bleed into years until it becomes the status quo. "

And strictly perimeter, prime Kobe was a better defender. He also played in the triangle offense which didn't depend on 1 primary playmaker. In 2012-2013 Kobe proved he could rack up 10 assists whenever he wanted. Lebron's a more efficient scorer, but Kobe never cared about efficiency. He never threw the ball to a teammate at the end of a shot clock, he was never worried about throwing up a half court shot to end the half. Something that Durant and Lebron don't do nearly as often. And Phil wanted Kobe shooting shots while double teamed, so they could be in position for the offensive rebound. Hence the Kobe assist which was a very effective gameplan for them. And considering Lebron is Mr efficient while Kobe is just a chucker, Lebron has a career 58% true shooting compared to Kobe's 55.5%.

> It's not. No where did I say that it was optimal. I'm just stating that you can't possibly lump every single player into the same mindset- fact is, everyone will play and think differently. This was my point.

You did say it. You said that it was a good idea to try to take down the invader first. It's not, really.

> I'm not jumping to his defense. I'm simply pointing out that it is not a 'gank' that we are seeing- that he just invaded into a world with a phantom, and a blue was summoned.

Yeah, you are? You even defended the host from points I didn't make right off the bat. Hell, if you didn't care about defending the host, then why are you arguing about topics unrelated to the actual argument (the fact that this is by definition a would-be gank) in defense of host and against invaders? Totally because it helps your argument! Spoilers: it doesn't.

> Maybe if you're stuck in a corner by them. But, if you're having a problem with people R1 spamming at you (even multiple people), then I'd suggest looking more in to fighting more than one person at a time- it's not incredibly difficult.

Um, no, you can very easily die to R1 spam because you can get hit way more than the regular 2 hit combo because of the fact that it's multiple people. Also... yes, it is difficult. Even if your opponents are pretty bad all they have to do is approach you and R1. You're probably used to seeing videos of Peeve, Oroboro, and other skilled PvPers who are fifty leagues above your opponent. If you aren't that much better than them then your chances of beating them aren't looking good.

> You didn't say that- but you definitely made it sound like the invader (i.e., the one trying to initiate PvP by halting someone elses' progress) was the one we should be pitying, because he had to fight the three of them. Guess what? That's what happens when you invade- yes it's weighted to be more towards worlds with phantoms in them, but this is nothing new to the series. People can (and will, if they feel the need) summon phantoms to defend themselves. Invaders have always had the chance of having to go up against multiple people.

Have you ever invaded? Or ever even seen all the complaints about how terribly one-sided invasions are in DS3? That whole paragraph of yours is pretty damn silly in the eyes of anyone that actually knows why DS3 invasions aren't the same. Just because you invaded someone without their consent doesn't mean that the game should fuck you sideways for it. It being so unfair for invaders is not a thing that has always been in the series; just look at DS2 lol. You could get invaded while being unable to summon help and being at 50% hp. Now? Almost always only if you have a buddy with you (who also gets estus and can be re-summoned as many times as you want) and you get +30% HP. Uh-huh. Exactly the same.

So yeah, I do pity invaders. Or have you never seen the gifs of people spawning right into a 4-man squad (who are just getting through the level) and getting instantly and unavoidably collectively R1ed the hell out of there?

> I don't think they ""planned"" anything other than going through the level together. The blue definitely wasn't in on any plan, since he got randomly selected to help out. It just so happened that it turned into a 3-on-1- there was no planning of any of it involved. There was no ""ganking"".

Dude, absolutely great work taking my sentences out of context! I didn't say they set-up a gank squad, for like the 5th time. By ""planned"" I thought it was pretty obvious that I meant ""made up their minds to"" or ""were trying to"" gank.

Also, please. Are you seriously defending a blue from being a ganker? Or that he wasn't planning on teaming up on an invader with unfair advantage over him? LMAOOOO

Sorry but that's just fucking absurd. The Blades of the Darkmoon is a covenant which entire fucking purpose is to outnumber and gank invaders. If you're in it, then you know that you are going to be summoned into a fight you have a huge chance of winning because you will always outnumber your opponents. That's why whenever I summon a blue, I leave them to fight the invader on their own. Because I know how much it fucking sucks to get ganked by 2-3 guys at once and being unable to do anything about it because they're not idiots like the ones on this gif.

> First, you cannot say with 100% certainty that they did it solely because he was a player and they just wanted to kill him (for ""kicks"", i believe you put it) with absolutely nothing else on their mind. That's just not possible. Second- of course they want to kill him. Like I said- he's solely there to kill them, and will do it any way possible. Getting rid of him sooner than later is just playing smart, not having wild bloodlust.

No, I can't say it with 100% assurance that they get a kick out of ganking players. But if they're chasing after the invader like that then chances are that since everyone likes winning, and beating a player in PvP is winning, that they indeed do it because they want to win and not because stupidly chasing an invader down, ignoring literally everything else in the way because of how concentrated the hosts are in their future mashing of the R1 button, leaving a horde of enemies running after you and who knows how many items behind is optimal (there you go again saying that it's optimal while using different words then saying you didn't say anything of the sort, too). Like, dude... Look at the gif this very thread is about and tell me again, with a straight face, that chasing after the invader mindlessly was a good move.

I'll spoil the answer for you: It wasn't a good idea to chase the invader like that because all 3 of the would-be gankers instantly died to the explosive barrels.

> Clearly this isn't 100% the case, since it seems that plenty of people agreed with me already in that it wasn't a gank- along with a few other posts in this thread.

Yeah. Those people also got their share of downvotes, hence the controversial symbol on their upvote count. Or they don't have that symbol and are just at negative or no upvotes.

And because you got 40 people to upvote you doesn't really mean that they think this isn't a gank? For all you know they upvoted you to collectively congratulate the OP (which they should). Seeing how people who only said ""this isn't a gank"" were downvoted, and you, who said something I see worth upvoting for besides that were not, I'd say that a good part if not most of those people ""agreeing"" with you aren't doing it over the semantics.

Even then, I'll repeat how this isn't suddenly not a would-be gank just because some people agreed with you on it.

> Yes, they are. Like I said- I'm 100% on-board with invaders. I love them. However, by invading, you are 100% going into their world with the mission to kill them and steal an Ember/Shackle/Whatever, simply for your own benefit, and setting them back in any progress they may have made. Regardless of how you look at it.

Yeah, uuuh, so? What's the point of this part? People don't invade for the rewards most of the time, either, but rather, because we enjoy chaotic, ruleless PvP. Doesn't mean that the game should be designed in an unfair way. Also, again, please stop acting like if every host and his phantoms are an innocent little nooblet. They very clearly enjoy beating you most of the time. That's why they taunt and celebrate. If they didn't care of the invader they'd do the smart thing and ignore them to get to the fog.

Speaking of ignoring, I'll mention you've skipped parts and points in my post to your convenience. Real smooth.

> No, it's not either of those. Funny how you would try to describe what a gank is, without knowing it yourself.

Oh, wow. Real good argument right here. ""Nope it's not lol"". Absolutely flawless.

I recommend checking anywhere that isn't DS where gank squads aren't a thing. In WoW, if you're a high level player or group of players and come into a low level player or single player in the middle of questing, and decide to go gank them, then that's as much as a gank as if you were waiting around for innocent players to gank.

I'm sure you know why. Because ""gank"" comes from ""gang kill"" and holds no other meanings, besides also evolving to refer to any situation where one party had no chances of winning (if you're a twink with maxed estus and endgame gear waiting for people on far greater disadvantages then you are ganking, even if alone).

The actually funny thing here is how you defend the host in this thread so zealously (of anything, really) of being a ganker like if you're automatically placed on the same place that gank squad members are. You aren't, because a gank squad is a different thing from people who are ganking by chance.

Since I actually put up my argument for this like twice and you didn't a single time, I'm guessing this is over here. Obviously, by saying this I pretty much guaranteed that you'll try to look for your way around it by nit-picking at the meaning of specific little details.

Proof by contradiction: let's assume what you said is true. I apply that criterion to the post I just linked to. I do a count of people who like the game, people who dislike the game, and people who mentioned the game but weren't easily classified. 

Like: 24

Dislike: 5

Can't classify: 7

Even in that quick and dirty count, there were far more people liking it than disliking it. So your statement is disproven - at least some threads have people liking Octopath Traveler, so you can't rely on that generalization as evidence. 

>Also r/octopathtraveler isnt ""thriving""

Admittedly an unclear definition. Define thriving. I'd call 20K+ subscribers from an install base of 1 million+ thriving. A comparable number of posts per day to /r/JRPG. More subscribers than some entire series (Dragon Quest with 18.9K). So no, I'm not exaggerating. I'm setting my standards according to similar Reddits. 

>Also you know that a highly rated game can be mediocre right? A rating does not define a games quality. 

Sure. That said, I would need a good argument for why the initial reviews were wrong. I'd need evidence. I'd need logical support. Simply saying that reviews aren't 100% accurate does not justify taking a converse position. 

>There are plenty of mainstream games that are nothing more than recycled garbage yet they constantly get 10/10s.

Evidence lacking. Also irrelevant, since we're not talking about ""plenty of mainstream games,"" but Octopath Traveler. 

>When I said the game was mediocre, I wasnt talking about the score, the score is irrelevant. The game itself is mediocre 

Right, and I called that an exaggeration and appealed to several sources of evidence. None of my sources are definitive; I agree that reviews, that user ratings, that thread comments aren't 100% reliable. That said, they are somewhat reliable; they provide a counterargument that you need to build a case against if you want more people to agree with you. 

So here's where we are: you insist Octopath Traveler is mediocre, but seem unwilling to provide any evidence or arguments to support your case. I think that's an exaggeration, and I'm providing counterarguments to see if you can elaborate in some way. I already disagree with you. You disagree with me. Are you going to provide any more detail to make this conversation worthwhile for both of us, or are you going to double-down on what you're saying but continue to refuse to support your ideas with evidence? 

By the way, there's no shame about walking away, about not having the time, or not having the interest. If that's true, have a great day. I'm just interested in learning from people I disagree with, and I'd rather cut out the posturing as much as possible. "

> There is NO RETURNS on PC games.

Of course not. If there was, everyone would buy the game, play it, and return it. It is the same reason there is no returns on CD's or DVD's. You are paying for an experience, not a physical product.

> And beyond that, I never buy a game I haven't tried, regardless of review.

That still does not entitle you to pirate anything.

> If you're dumb enough to spend a ton of money based on what some biased author has to say about the subject, well, congratulations.

A ""review"" is not limited to a 5 page essay posted on a gaming website. A review could come from a user on a forum, or just a friend or co-worker talking to you about a game in real life. I doubt your friends have all been paid off by gaming companies to give you biased reviews.

> You would have hated Rosa Parks, eh? Illegal bitch should have stayed on her side of the bus.

> PROTIP: Just because it's illegal doesn't mean it's wrong.

While that might have some truth to it, you cannot possibly compare video game piracy to racism. Seriously, this is just as bad as pulling the ""nazi"" card, and comparing DRM to hitler. The analogy does not hold up. When you pirate something, you are taking someone's hard work without permission. If you cannot see that, that is wrong, without it being illegal, then there is something wrong with your moral compass.

> Again, I don't view piracy as wrong.

"> I do think that notion is far removed from reality. Just like I think the notion of native Americans somehow retaking the US is unrealistic. I don't necessarily think it's okay for indigenous ethnic groups to disappear, I just don't care very much about that and see it as essentially inevitable, at least in certain places. 

You are making another false equivalence. Native Americans and white Americans are not analogous groups. The matter of changing the ethnic battle in the US to favor whites is mostly a legal one. It is a question of what we as whites allow others to do. Comparing that with native Americans who are a 5 million or so people ""retaking"" the US is childish. If you still feel the notion is far removed I would have to get better justifications than that. 
(Just on a personal note the idea of white ethnic extinction being inevitable reeks of white submissivism. Such loser mentality is pathetic, weak and disgusting. Go lift some weights.)

> Mainly because that's what tends to happen (the problem of induction, I know). My view of the AR is that it's an unpopular fringe movement, do you not see yourself this way? If I had to guess, I would say that the AR causing serious changes is about as likely as the Communist Party USA doing so. 

The notion of multiracial, multicultural nations was a radical one as well 70 years ago. Yet here we are. The UK leaving the EU was considered radical and openly laughed at 13 years ago, yet here we are. I feel your view on politics and how political change occurs is not very realistic. In most countries far right groups that gain momentum are eaten up by the bigger softer right groups to gain voters. The political will of the far right gets pushed forward that way. The existence of AR talking points spreads even if they don't carry the brand. An example would be UKIP and Nigel Farage pushing Brexit into reality.(not saying either are AR, just an example of fringe political movements reaching their goals.) 

> I don't know much about Brexit and the AR but Trump has said some pretty unfavorable things[...] maneuvering, doesn't that seem to imply that the AR is at least not going to get any political power in the very near future?

The AR doesn't need direct political power to get its will across. But no, to me it does not imply that. No one here expects Spencer and Anglin to be called up for the next administration. We expect guys who hide their power level or guys who do our bidding because they want our votes. The AR brand is unpopular but the ideas behind it are not.

> This might be just a semantics difference, but I would probably call that a revolution still, even if it's somewhat of a return to a previous state. Returning to the state of nature, for example, I would also call a revolution. 

Again, a false equivalence. Repealing laws that where put in place 50 years ago is not analogous to returning to the ""state of nature"". I could agree that it is a revolution like the passing of the laws in the first place was a revolution. But the word ""revolution"" in that case sounds inflationary to me. 

> Isn't the idea of creating an ethnostate where one does not currently exist also relatively untested? The one example I can think of (Israel) has had a lot of conflict. 

I don't understand where you get the idea that an ethnostate never existed in the US. I already showed you how the US was an ethnostate since its inception up until Hart-Celler in 65'. The ethnostate is the default. Modern day European countries are ethnostates that very recently stopped enforcing their borders and replaced the benefit of the people living within those borders with the benefit of outsiders. Before WW1 almost all countries in Europe where ethnostates like they had been for hundreds of years. The case of Israel is a pointless one since jews never had a country before. The Europeans already have their countries. They just need to enforce their borders and protect their sovereignty from outside influence. It's a question of legal enforcement and not, out of the blue, nation building. Same goes for the US. 


> Because your options are cede to fight another day or die. [...] I don't think that's a realistic goal, especially given current trends. 

I disagree with what you think the options are. It is far easier to impact US laws from within the US than it is to secede from the US. But in any case what you are talking about is already happening. There are large groups of whites creating clusters and enclaves around the US. There is no reason to not fight the battle at a local and a national level at the same time. 

And again, you lean on the current trends like a crutch as if there is no way to reverse them when you can do so easily(look at artificial baby booms in Denmark). But just for kicks here is a current trend for you: Conservative whites in the US are breeding at and above replacement level. That is, over 2.1 child per woman. Do you know what that means? The whites that are dying out are majority left leaning. The future generations of whites will be more conservative and right wing. I don't think whites will peter out and die like a warm gust of wind. I think in the worst case they will go to war to retake their country. I want to prevent that future by retaking the country peacefully while we still can.(This whole thing is getting pretty larp heavy though)

> I don't think asians are superior, I just don't understand why the members of the AR don't. 

Because the question you ask is based on your own misunderstanding and misuse of terms. 
Read the FAQ. The term you use: ""superior"" makes no sense without you giving it context. The fact that they score on average higher on the IQ test does not mean I should therefor want to live with them. Just like the low IQ of blacks doesn't mean I should therefor not want to live with them. Your logic doesn't make any sense. Dogs have low IQ's. The AR therefor must hate these inferior dogs.(Dogs are great btw)

> This is the main things I still don't understand. What distinguishes the two, in your opinion?

The AR are WN because only whites can authentically maintain white society. 

Your whole conflict rests on your own misrepresentation of what people here think. 

> I would say that the majority tend to view whites as superior at least to blacks.

Superior in what way? Superior in being white and maintaining white society? Hell yeah. Superior in sprinting? I don't think you will find anybody here who thinks that. 

Your whole question relies on the people of the AR to hold the same childish notions of the existence of some ""superiority"" that you hold. This is simply not the case. Blacks are great at many things. Being white is not one of them. E-Asians are great at many things. Being white is not one of them. Using absolutist vague terms like ""inferior"" and ""superior"" is stupid. People here don't do that and AR ideas are not based around such useless distinctions.

And in this version, Austrian Empire list of general consists of terrible generals all around with NO mountaineers, which actually I consider more realistic than HoI IV rendition of it in Kaiserreich. Garbage generals of Darkest Hour are far closer to resembling the state of Austrian army rather than wankery we have currently in HoI IV Kaiserreich. In general, your commentary such as:

...makes me think you actually didn't have enough patience to read it and try to understand it. You likely did not play Darkest Hour version of this mod either, because otherwise you would immediately know what I'm talking about.

>As for Austria having two tank generals... well, Erhard Raus was one of the best in the OTL Wehrmacht, while Rendulic is a lot more controversial, he was still seriously skilled.

And they shouldn't be Panzer Leaders (the trait that immediately grants bonuses) but Panzer Officers, the same as most of German staff with exception of Guderian. That would I consider normal.

Expect for the fact that both of those generals also have wanked ADPL points, so I would consider changing that too.

> This is also hurt by the fact that, IMO, Guderian is seriously overrated both as a commander and as a theorist. In fact, a lot of Wehrmacht commanders have been.

I would say opposite, ADPL points distribution makes most of German generals underrated, including Guderian, but the case mostly stings in case of Manstein.

"Sigh.

Your statement absolutely implies that we should have accepted Obama's campaign promise to close Guantanamo as a hypertechnical budgetary one.

"Yes, the quality of privately provided public/common pool goods is amazing! Well, when they get provided, which isn't often (because they are not private goods). And wait, even when they are provided it's simply not true that the quality is categorically ""better"". Have a look at some of the privatized prisons in the USA. They're shocking. Have a look at privatized policing or defence. It's terrifying. And even when they are ""better"" (within one country), that's in part because they have crowded out public provision.

they are not customs either. Both Grimsmo and Hoback use a CNC to grind their blades.

Hoback did customs in the past, but not since he went full out with the CNC production of his stuff. they're about as 'custom' as a MSC ""performance series"", if that...at least Mick grinds the blades on those. 

then you have makers like peter carey and allen elishewitz, mayo, nalu, foster, ochs, barajas, rexford, southard, SIBERT...even emerson... that make the same model knife, but with multiple types of high end materials, with complications...inlays, pivot rings, clips etc which are cut out, profiled, milled, pantographed and then hand fitted, not to mention dovetailing bolsters, shadowboxing frames, texturing..along with contouring and finishing. Makers like Burch utilize a CNC to help them cut out parts, but finish everything by hand, including grinding the blade, cutting locks and fitment. 

Each blade is cut from sheet, profiled, ground, heat treated and finished by one man, not a machine with a tool path.

The writing was abysmal. It wasn't intelligent on any level. Many times it seemed like it was at a 6th grade literature level.

This is lines such as ""I’m haunted by the kiss that you should never have given me.”, ""From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!”, and let's not forget ""Yousa thinking yousa people ganna die?”. How do you explain characters like Jar Jar Binks or even child Anakin Skywalker being anywhere near a Brechtian themed film?

"While you have a point to make, there are several errors in your thinking here. 

First, the definition of inflation involves rising prices. That may usually involve movement in the money supply or not, but that doesn't change the definition of the word. 

Second, inflation is not always caused by an increase in the money supply, and an increase in the money supply does not always cause inflation. For an example of the latter point, consider a liquidity trap and Japan over the 1990's. Increase the money supply is irrelevant in a situation with zero interest rates because holding money is equivalent to holding bonds, and so it may be very difficult to generate inflation despite a wild increase in the money supply. For an example of the former, consider weather shocks that increase the cost of food, or global demand shocks that increase the cost of natural resources. Those have nothing to do with money supply increases.

Third, on the subject of the hidden tax, I'm afraid your point is a bit undeveloped and so it is hard to address. In the current atmosphere though, the concern is that banks are decreasing their lending, thus shrinking the money supply. The actions of the Federal Reserve are countering that shrinkage. It's important not to consider these policies outside of their context. During the great depression, the Fed did what you suggested, and the money supply did not stay constant -- it shrank, because of the collapse of the banking system. That's a much more real consequence to me than some vague hidden tax.

Fourth, ""printing treasury bonds"" is a bit incoherent as a statement. Someone has to buy those bonds; it's hard to know what you mean.

"Petitions do work, just not on their own. You can't just say ""here's two thousand signatures"" because you're right, they don't give a fuck. You have to put MASSIVE pressure on them, petitions, calling their offices day and night, protesting constantly. In order to change something you can NOT let the movement stop pushing otherwise they'll push you back further than you were when you started.

I only said ""little plans"" because I didn't want to use other language that would put any positive spin on and it's just a phrase I say because it accurately describes the aforementioned plan, a little plan. If you plan to destroy a fluoride additive tank at one plant then you've destroyed one thing in America, a country of 313.9 million people, then you have a little plan. If you plan to attack a few individuals that don't control it all, it's a little plan.

A big plan, sometimes called a grand scheme, involves a whole lot more organization and planning then just ""let's fuck some shit up and hope it sends a message and changes things"".

"No, I did. You are too stupid to grasp the correct physics. 

Again, its a symmetrical plane. The actual path it carves is a conical section. The dimensions of that section are a function of the time the ball spends intersecting that plane, and that is a function of the width of the plane, the diameter of the ball, and the speed of the ball. Nothing else is in that equation. The width of the plane does not change during the rotation. Nor does the size of the ball. The only thing that changes is the speed: it slows. As it slows, the corresponding size of the conical section it carves as it passes through the plane formed by the cylinder grows.

Thats literally all that matters in the calculation.

"> Yes it is. We're talking about the likelihood of emergence. Not the number of times you can run a simulation.

Are you suggesting that we would create a universe and then wait for eons for life to emerge? It does not have to be that way. 

There are many ways of simulating a universe. 

Imagine the SIMS game , just as they are today. Now imagine some guy manages to add some intelligence / sentience software to them . 

That's a simulated reality. No need for emergence. Do you agree with this? 

>Its called an objective point of view.

But this is wrong. You are not being objective. You are missing the point. We are not talking about just any simulation we are talking about reality itself. And you miss it. 

>We're talking about emergence, not the number of times you can play a video game.

Emergence of what? 

This is not about how many times you can play the SIMS game. Its about how many sims games you can create . If we can build one we have to assume that many more will be built. 

Lets take simple steps and see where its going wrong.

1) There can be only one base reality. 

2)If we create a simulated universe then we can assume that many more will be built. 

3)If there si only one reality and more than one simulated realities then our chances of being in a simulated one is higher . 

Do you agree with these claims. 

>Your argument is analogous to the strong anthropic principle. You're insinuating that intelligence and technology are some kind of end game as if the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have technologically advanced life emerge within it. But only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of simulating it.

You are still at stuck at the same place. 

You are thinking we will create a universe just like ours , it will start with a big bang and we will wait for life to emrege etc etc .

Forget it all. 

Just think about the sims example. Some guy , tomorrow creates an update to the SIMS game and it gives them the ability of consciuosness. From then on , in an instant , with no emergence , that guy will create a simulated universe. Do you agree with this?

>You're ignoring all the selective pressures it takes to get to that point, and all of the worlds that likely exist that don't even develop life to being with.

You are stuck with the idea that we have to follow the exact same path as nature does to create simulated realities. We don't. There is no need for emergence. 

>Life would have still had to evolve before it to simulate it.

Why do you keep saying that? How can you be sure that we can not create a conscious Super Mario, even within a few years from now? 

You have to leave this idea that a simulated universe has to be exactly like ours and it has to follow the exact same paths of evolution until intelligent life emerges from it. It doesn't have to that way. You are stuck with this idea and you cant see anything further than that. No offense.

"1) Well, okay. I can't change your mind on this, and quite frankly, I accept some of what you are saying. But a few points. One: alot of these things only have one or two avenues to how they work, based on what we know of them. We know that the Lymans Ear and Neuroglottis are replacements, that the pre-omnor is just a pre-fill sack, etc. There are, in fact, alot of organs one may even consider superfluous. But guess what, you didn't have to read it, and your opinions, whilst sometimes interesting, aren't that constructive. I was setting out to do something for fun; not to change the face of the lore, or facilitate a discussion for you to have. I just wanted to put out some extra info to cover how I think they may work. You can disagree, and you can move on, but devaluing something because it wasn't what YOU wanted at that current time, is more then a little petty. On top of that, people like you are actually preventing many of the speculative options you claim to want, as if my explanations differ even slightly from the lore, it gets lambasted. BTW, the oolotic kidney would likely require a dedicated arterial channel able to intercept the flow of both renal arteries and channel it through the organ and directly into one of the major posterior arteries. There, question answered.

2) You asserted that it would be possible, under a hormone-dependent form of Astartes transformation process (the biscopea and ossmodula functions) for present-day humanity to create something similar. This was meant as a refutation of that concept, based on some of the many, many things we are missing.

3) Hormones can lead to structural changes. This is what you are failing to grasp. Your view of hormones is actually surprisingly limited for someone who claims to have a higher level of scientific understanding then me. Put simply, HGH is one of the key hormones involved in osteogenesis, with its application in that capacity somewhat guided by other hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone. IF we are accepting that the hormone produced by the Ossmodula over-rides these hormones, including the programming hormones, then, should one have a knowledge of genetics and biology far in advance of our own, it would be possible to trigger the Osteoblasts to grow bone in a formation that deviates from the natural human form, thus allowing a higher and denser growth of muscle through specialized artificial growth hormone and myostatin inhibition. This also applies to the expansion of tissue within the internal organs of the body, such as the kidneys, lungs, heart, and circulatory system: growth in vivo is triggered through hormones, and if we substitute human growth hormones for those that create transhuman results (currently an impossibility) then the effect would be to fundamentally alter the biology of the individual. The Astartes, by the way, have never been mentioned as receiving muscular implants. That is not a canon part of the lore, nor would it be particularly useful compared to the growth of muscle going hand-in-hand with unnatural skeletal development. Now that's not to say that it is the only factor, and I never said it was. In fact, I conceded, earlier on, that most organs likely fulfill a secondary function in releasing a targeted retrovirus that enhances the biology by introducing a section of engineered genetic material. But what we know of biology, not just human but animal as well, says that any growth must have a hormonal trigger. You can't refute that. Even if we are dealing with retroviral genetic manipulation, the trigger must still be hormonal in nature.

4) You see, I thought that you were referring to retrovirals as the sole creator. If you are saying it must be a part of the process that goes hand in hand with the hormonal releases of the Ossmodula, we are in agreement. In fact, it would also be one of the best explanations as to why the first implanted organ is the heart: it is the best vector through which to introduce a retroviral gene-modding agent to the host, prepping them for future enhancements and lowering the risk of rejection. Also, my post was mainly focused on what they do when they are functioning. For instance, during function, the Catalespan node is introducing asymmetric neurotransmitters segregated to specific portions of the brain to simulate action in slow-wave sleep (deep sleep). It is the loss of REM that causes psychological problems in the Marine if overuse becomes a factor.

5) Ah, when you said muscle insertions I assumed you meant as a transplant, but you were actually referring to the different sections of the muscle. Now, I will certainly admit that the structure of muscles is governed in no small part by genetics... HOWEVER, the mechanism of action that leads to this change, and its appearance later in life, is, as in all human growth, hormonally based. The genetics of a person determine how the hormonal balance of the body will grow the muscles, not what the completed structure will look like. Now, in regards to the SM's, the structure of these muscles is determined by the Biscopea. The books don't say anything else on the matter, but using that, and an understanding of biology, it is clear that the biscopea controls growth patterns using inhibiting agents, as well as regulating factors that could themselves be inhibitors, such as myostatins. That kind of science is leagues beyond what we have now, and would require the genetics of the individual altered, but, and this is important, no growth of any kind occurs without a biological system producing its action hormonally.

6) Hormones, programmed in, reacting with genetic material predisposed for a certain growth patter, will grow the joints in a different pattern. Now, this is still likely going to share a massive similarity to a human joint, however there will be important differences. Chief among these differences is that the biology of the individual is predisposed to rapid healing and recovery, meaning that what, in a human, would be worn down to nothing is, in an Astartes, constantly replenished. Additionally, the structure of ligaments in the joint will likely include many redundancies that baseline humans lack. For example, the ACL will have additional supporting ligamenture, as well as simply being of a greater material quality. This will be found throughout the rest of the body, most notably in the major skeletal joints. It's actually not that difficult to imagine how these joints would work.

In regards to the brain, it depends on what you consider to be a major structural change, and what you consider to be the mode of action of their mental changes. Currently, we can say that the majority of the structure of the Aspirants brain is set in stone when they are inducted; the only major changes to lobe size and structure are the growth of the visual cortex related to the occulobe, the catalespan node, and the Sus'an Membrane. Now, all three of these are major, but their effects wouldn't increase the intelligence of a Marine. Genetic alteration doesn't explain it alone, as, as I have already stated, most growth, including practically all synapse growth, is complete by the time the Aspirant is inducted. Thus, the question becomes; how do you grow the brain? Now, we could argue that there must be a further growth of synapses, but that would require both genetic alteration to reactivate the stem-cell properties of neural tissue (or the addition of stem-cells through, for example, the catalespan node), and hormonal triggers to allow that growth to occur. Alternatively, we could make the case that the major changes to the brain are not grown in, but rather trained in through hypnotherapy, allowing patterns of thought that would be incomprehensible for normal humans to be easily developed. Personally, I have to lean towards a mix of the two, as the Astartes brain needs to process data from various additional organs in an autonomic fashion, and the human brain doesn't have the space for that to occur, but without the correct training on these new centers, administered via hypnotherapy, they would likely be little more then useless chunks of grey matter.

7) Once again, I was doing a thought exercise, and comparing something outside of reality to in-reality counterparts. In some cases, there was nothing to expand on, as the structure of ears is far too complex to speculate about how a perfectly engineered one would present. In regards to their interlocking functions, I don't know, apart from the Biscopea and Ossmodula, what exactly you are referring to. Are you referring to the second hearts interaction with the multi-lung (big surprise, hearts and lungs go together) the larramans organ, or the oolotic kidney (organs whose action is dependent on the circulatory system interact with the organ in the circulatory system)? Is it about the action of the preomnor and the omophagea (there isn't one, the omophagea is in the stomach)? What organ have I failed to recognised to your satisfaction? Let me know.

8) Wikipedias best use in research is as a launching ground into actual reputable sources.

9) You disagree with my assessment of the betchers gland? How so? The glands produce a metal-corrosive venom. In the human body, even stomach acid requires a major mucus membrane to avoid damaging the walls of the stomach, and this is a great deal more corrosive then that. Thus, it must have a form of acid-resistant mucus. When excreting the venom, this mucus must also be excreted to the surrounding area so as to prevent tissue damage. The glands must be operated by a specific muscle group, or they wouldn't be able to shoot the venom at a variable pressure, and the venom must be produced in-gland, because the body lacks a system for transmitting corrosives. What do you think the method of action is?

"> Well just because something is in the terms doesn't mean it's ethical or a good business practice

I don't disagree. 

However, that's not the issue. Pick your favorite company that has a ToS or T&C - read it. I promise you'll find a similar set of terms from almost all businesses like GUMI or other games. LoL? WoW? You'd be surprised at what they're able to do based on the ToS you agreed to and how powerless you are. And why should you be (other than purchasing protections)? They made a game. If you want to play it, you have to agree to the rules they put for for playing it (speaking mostly about online games.) 

>From a customer satisfaction level, saying ""We can do what we want because you agreed to it"" is pretty much as bad as it gets and is a sure-fire way to ensure that people no longer do business with you.

But they're not saying that - I just pointed out that they're protected in their ability to say that. And they're not alone. Apple, Blizzard, Riot - check em - you'll find a very similar set of terms and most people are so eager to play the game (and terribly impatient) that they can't be bothered to read them.

Yet, you agreed to them - your ignorance of what you agreed to is does not excuse you from any consequences that arise from that ignorance.

Unfounded hyperbole based on rumor and myth. Facts: people were banned, reasons were given, false flags happened, bans reviewed, accounts slowly being unbanned. Anything else you add to that is speculation and has ZERO factual basis. That's what I take issue with - the hyperbole and nonsense.

Then you're not seeing the big picture. Lack of experience will lead to that. The bans are an attempt to protect the investments of spenders and free players - so that they perceive and realize value out of accumulated or purchased in-game currency. If hackers/cheaters are able to escape punishment, then that devalues the in-game currency and the desire to purchase it for use (why bother if hackers can achieve those results faster and without spending?) Because it undermines their business model: it's not just about the 100 or so cheaters in each FH, it's about the disenfranchised players who see cheaters trumping their hard work and decide that there's no longer any value in purchasing in-game currency. Or playing...etc.

"In some cases yes and in some cases no. So you are saying that in my case, it was not necessary rape, but you just called me a rape apologist for expecting other people to be responsible for their own actions when they are drunk? To me it oozes of hypocrisy. 

The world is more complex than you realize. People have sex all the time for other reasons than that they genuinely want to. There is a whole spectrum, from violent rape, rape of someone that is unconscious, threatening to fire someone if he or she doesn't agree to sex, threatening to break up with someone if he doesn't agree to have sex, crying for not getting sex, sulking for not getting sex. Or from the other side, having sex for money or drugs, to get a promotion, a rise or a better job, to get your partner to agree to something unrelated, to get your partner to forgive you for something stupid you did, to get your crying or sulky partner or friend to feel better about themselves. Having sex with your spouse because you feel that it is your obligation.

I think you are making a huge mistake if you insist on calling all these things rape just because they don't agree with your ideals of what sex should be. Some things are clearly rape. Other things should be punished even though they, to my mind, shouldn't be called rape, such as the employer that uses her position of power to get sex from an employee. 

Some things are just called to be an asshole. Some are just weird. Other things do have a genuine humane function in relationships even if one of the partner does make sacrifices, and might not feel lust at the moment.

Calling all of the above rape does a huge disservice to those who actually have been forced upon. "
">That's a rather strong assertion considering you didn't add any specific situations to support it.

The ""specific situations"" were the arguments you've been making thus far. The reason I make the assertion is because you said the following:

>This is my perspective as well. It seems to be clear. The exact words are used and condemned throughout the Bible in the old and new testaments.
> 
>However, the issue I'm having is from the arguments made by those who claim homosexuality isn't sinful due to problems translating greek to english, perspectives of the biblical authors, and the idea that Jesus was NOT refuting homosexuality in his answer on divorce to the pharisees--the argument here being that Jesus was answering a specific question, to specific people, in a method that they would understand and relate to and that it has nothing to do with homosexuality. This argument makes sense, but isn't completely solid. But even the least bit of doubt would put this concept in a danger zone where we could be, well, wrong. It's not like our interpretations of the Bible haven't been wrong before--except in this case we are condemning people who shouldn't be condemned, so to me this is a highly important subject where we need to find out ALL the information instead of rely on past understanding.

And yet you do not entertain the idea that the Bible is simply fallible and not the direct word of God. If this is one of your ""core principles"" of Christianity, then please understand I understand that to mean ""an assumption I am unwilling to question."" If that is not the case, and you feel you've arrived at the conclusion that such an assumption is correct, then please illuminate how you've done so.

>Also, a rather obvious straw man that I countered in your other post.

It is not a strawman argument, as it was not intended to misrepresent your argument. I made a comment about what I suspected your thought process was, a comment intended to prompt you to question it and respond. 

>Honestly, it seems you have some sort of presupposition towards a group of people, and are applying that concept to this discussion and myself

No, I'm not. I've met many religious people who don't do this, but I have noticed that they tend to have much more abstract views of the Divine, and tend not to adhere to any doctrinal viewpoint. You don't know me, and haven't witnessed me label other people as such elsewhere, so on what basis are you making this assertion?

>which you are then using to discount any of the rational and thought out points I've made.

While some of your thoughts/arguments have been logical, they all seem to terminate as soon as they get too messy/conflicting, and you seem to fall back on the idea that that just means God's intent is really complex, and more investigation is needed to uncover his true meaning. Why can't the messy conflicts be due to the reasons I've proposed? This is what makes it seem like you're assuming God and the accuracy of the Bible, because you seem unwilling to entertain the idea that the Bible is full of contractions, because it was written by human beings, not God. If that's the case, please explain how you know that.

>Well, you did come to a sub specifically made for Christians to discuss a difficulty in a topic that is effecting the world at the moment. So, am I to feel pity for you at the moment?

You completely missed the point of my comment, and quoted only a portion of what I said. Furthermore, that last sentence is just plain caustic and unnecessary. I know where I'm posting, and why. I am here for some healthy discussion, but I've found that arguing over specific points of doctrine is unproductive, because the process or at the very least starting assumptions between myself and the person I'm debating with aren't the same. The point of me asking you to clarify your assumptions and why you assume them above is to clear up the ground the discussion is based on, and make sure we're not wasting time debating particulars, when we don't actually agree on the basics. 

>Yeah, we are currently using the same system which may hit some kinks every now and then but continued, honest search yields truth.

This has not been my impression of apologetics at all, for the reasons I've already stated—God and the truth of the Bible are assumed, rather than concluded through evidence-based thinking. Evidence-based arguments are often made by apologetics to support these assumptions, but—as you have been doing—evidence that contradicts those assumptions are dismissed as needing further investigation, which just means you're cherry picking your data.

>you seem to have a faulty understanding of what Faith is and what it does for the Christian.

If you think so, then please provide me with your definition of faith, and I can then tell you whether or not I disagree with it and why. You claim to have done this at the end of your post, but as near as I can tell, all you said was:

1: Only faith in Jesus/God is required of Christians.
>Faith - required in one place Biblically, and that is essentially the core concept that Jesus is God. It does not and cannot stand alone as it says many times that misplaced faith is just as bad as no faith at all.

2: I'm defining faith thusly:
>Faith -The inherent belief that anything told to us by claim of Jesus or otherwise is inherently true and requires no further analysis. This faith is more important than reason because it's deeper, and therefore it can be at direct odds with logic or evidence and still be true.

3: Obviously, there's a difference between our definitions of faith.
>As you can see, actual the faith we have as Christians is much different than the way you are defining it. So what do you say we stop discounting my reasoning simply because you wrongly defined Faith then assumed it to be my stance. (Which again, would be plainly seen as false if you had read anything in this sub.)

But you never defined what faith is explicitly, so I don't see what basis you're claiming a disagreement with me. I'm sure you do disagree, but you haven't properly articulated your opposing view yet, so please do so.

>And since every single post you've made so far has made that same presupposition and poisoned the well to where you now regret speaking to me about my faith on a sub specifically made for such people: well let's just say I admire your faith.

More causticity. I never said I regretted posting here, and I certainly don't think I've been ""poisoning the well"" as you assert. And you admire my faith? Faith in what, exactly?

But more to the point, I have no interest in having an argument here. I only enjoy discussions. I'm sorry if my assertion that you weren't thinking logically pissed you off, but that is honestly the impression I've gotten from your arguments, and if you can't accept that and try to approach our disagreement with civility, rather than getting defensive and argumentative, then I have no interest in continuing this thread.

If she's telling him that other guys pay for their friends to do things, then what is he expected to think other than that's what she wants?

Even weirder is, like, if we're just one big atom in a larger universe, how do we know all the little atoms don't have, you know, little universes in them, with little people living on them, with little cars and little houses, and maybe even itsy-bitsy tiny[...] international symposiums on cutting-edge theoretical physics, even.""""

After searching up Dr. Sanjay Gupta and advanced quantum hydroponics (hydroponics has nothing to do with quantum studies, hydroponics is a way of growing food very efficiently) I found that the original article talking about this theory was made by The Onion, a well known PARODY NEWS WEBSITE!

2. This shows no evidence and is purely speculative, it doesn't even actually touch on the subject you say it does! The author also has shown no qualifications.

3. This is the daydreaming of a (presumably high school) student, there is no evidence shown to prove it, and there are actually alternatives offered which act counter to it!

4. The simpsons... the simpsons aren't known to be very scientifically accurate, and after all, this is joke.

This is just... mind numbingly against every part of the scientific method. There is no evidence, there is nothing that it is built off. All of theoretical physics is an extension of our current knowledge of the universe, not a contradiction of known physical entities. This is not theoretical physics, this is pseudo-scientific daydreaming.

If this was true, and part of the SVtFoV; I would be very disappointed in the writing team of the show, it isn't that hard to access the information that shows that it is false. Just google ""The Standard Model""

I wasn't saying that Doctor Who has good science, I was saying that it is a similar concept, and that referring to the TARDIS is an apt analogy to the situation, I could have said ""there is a space inside the wand that is much larger on the inside than on the outside"" but instead I just said ""TARDIS-like abilities"" I apologize for this assumption that you would understand my meaning of this."

"Just to let you know I took a human sexuality course last term, and a registered sexologist taught us that pedophilia was an inborn condition that can be treated by therapy but not ""cured"". His stance was that chemical castration is unnecessarily cruel, as being without your balls does not change who you would find attractive. Being impotent doesnt stop sexual abuse. The 5% who commit these attrocities wont stop because they cant penetrate. From what I took from his instruction was that it is another tier of sexual desire.

"I foster for a rescue and I agreethat the process seems very lengthy and frustrating.

I do know that the rescue has to answer to alot of people (board, government) and have had many fucked up adopters in the past, so each step & rule in the process is made so that fuck-up doesn't happen again. The rescue ALWAYS puts in a least $500 into each dog to vet it, spay/neuter and transport with very little of it returned in adoption fees. 

Yes, they are very zealous and protective, but they have seen way more abuse and horrible things than the average Joe ... things you would not believe. So, I forgive them for making adopters jump through hoops because all the dogs do eventually get adopted. I would rather a dog only go to one last home after all the crap they have been through in the past. So many dogs come in emaciated - pelvic bones jutting out and greasy dandruff from lack of nutrition. We nurse them back to health and get very picky about who gets them. 

They can also give you a very clear description of this dog's issues which you never get on Craigslist. The dogs have lived with a foster for a minimum of 2 weeks so we know if they are aggressive, fearful, good with cats, etc. That information alone is worth the wait. What do you do if the dog you get on Craigslist comes with a bunch of expensive medical issues and a host of behavioural problems? 

Getting a dog should never be something you do in a hurry. I know once you decide you want the dog NOW. But slowing it down and jumping through hoops weeds out the want-it-now types and rewards the patient in-it-for-the-long-haul people, which is what a dog owner must be.

As for the fenced yard, yes, your country setting seems ideal but it is not always. Wild animals can hurt a dog when it wanders off by itself. It will take weeks for your dog to realize this is home and for him to stay close - what do you do in the meantime? People can come onto your land and hurt your dog. Or worse - your dog can hurt them and you get sued. Bigger and more freedom is not always better."

"You know that TARP and the Stimulus are two different things right? TARP was the bank bailout that occurred in 2008 before Obama took office, and though ill planned and executed did stop the haemorrhaging on Wall Street which ended the banking crisis, though banking reforms still need to be made. The Stimulus in 2009 tried to revive the economy and worked to the extent that we didn't slip into a grave depression but it was nowhere big enough and had too many tax cuts and not enough direct spending to make the recovery faster.

The Iraq War, yeah we agreed under Bush that we would pull out by the end of 2011, however it wasn't a treaty, it was a political agreement and as such still the purview of the President to remain in Iraq past that date. Would it be a violation of Iraqi sovereignty for us to remain into 2012? Yes, but let's not forget that McCain was willing to have us remain there for the next ""100 years"". Obama however decided to stick to the agreement though he had every ability not to, and there were many in the GOP that wanted us and still want us to be there, and remain in Iraq to this day. So its only misleading to suggest that Obama ended the war, but not false, there's just a bit of nuance that needs to be understood."

"> You know, when I said that you sound like you just learned about self-determination, and are essentially working from a misapplied dictionary definition, I intentionally qualified it, because I thought that's just ridiculous. And you literally just confirmed that this is the case.

I already knew what self determination was long before, since you know, it's kind of required in most schools in America. I just sought the most reputable source since I expected you to redefine terms. It's not my first time dealing with apologists who take ridiculous mental leaps.

So there's nothing I could contribute to you on this issue, no matter how I tried. I could write walls of text about this, and you'll just try to ""refute"" it instead of listening

Apparently not. You justify your claims with ridiculous premises.

> 3. Sometimes an adversarial approach is helpful to understand a subject, but not when there's such a large knowledge gap, and not when the quality of the arguments is so low (simply brushing it off as ""too ignorant for rebuttal"", saying ""the dictionary doesn't agree"", etc.). 

The gap was kind of why I refused to even address your lie. Self determination refers to nations. A nation does not require territory. A nation is more like an ethnic community. An example of nations without territory is the Romani people. Does their lack of territory render them no longer a nation? Of course not. That you thought it did entitle one to territory says much about your ignorance.

> So let's just leave this topic alone. I'll just say that if you're interested in the topic, you should read about it, because it's as important to the Palestinian claim as it is to the Israeli one. 

Trust me, I've read extensively about this. Kind of what led me to disdain Israel's apologists like you who say it was the Palestinians fault for not wanting to divide their homeland.

> Please try to be civil. It's enough of a challenge to write this comments, without you acting like an edgy 12-year-old.

I'm very impatient with those who argue ridiculous things. Such as you're doing with your belief that Palestinians could see into the future

> That, simply put, is a right you just made up. They did have a right to self-determination - the right to their own country (let's for a second use ""my"" definition here). But they had no right to deny another people self-determination, simply because they thought only Arabs have the right to rule in Arabia. 

Better phrased. No one had the right to choose what Palestinians did with their homeland. And self determination, again, does not entitle anyone to territory he does not occupy.

> And the sure as hell didn't have the right to start a war of aggression to get that land by force. Whereas the previous one was simply a right they didn't have, this one is a grave violation of international law.

I fear you're trying to Strawman me. I have experiences with many apologists on this sub and I know how easily others misinterpret my views after I explicitly declare otherwise. But anyway, it remains irrelevant to the truth of what we're discussing.

> I think you're confusing ""rational"" with ""emotionally acceptable to a hardcore nationalist"". The matter of fact is, the Palestinians didn't have a country of their own. They were handed an opportunity to get one by the British. So the ship on ""no one has a right to decide the status of your homeland"" already sailed. And they rejected that opportunity. 

Oh no, I mean rational. They did not require to have a political state. They were still a people with a homeland that they had lived in for generations. The British did not have any right to decide for them and the rule that the Brits had was supposedly based on the principle of consent by the governed.  http 

> The Jews didn't. That's my point. You think they were irrational? Or, as I suggested, that they secretly thought they didn't deserve it as much as the Arabs?

Do try to understand what I'm saying. The Jews had, I believe, 7 percent of the land at the time. The proposed agreement was obviously in their favor. I'm asking about the choice of the Palestinians. Why would they have left? Why were they supposed to bear the burden of european antisemitism? You haven't even addressed those questions I initially asked you.

Awesome, but technically speaking they weren't wrong, sooo there's that... And the only reason I used that phrase wasn't to state my belief that I think they were the 2nd worst pass defense.

And yet everyone from that time until now has or will see death. He clearly predicted that he would return to rule the world within the life span of some of his followers.

Now look, I get it, you all but have to redefine the meaning of ""death"" or else your entire religion falls apart. So I understand why you yourself are willing to delude yourself. I'm just here to tell you that I'm not that gullible and have no need to engage in mental gymnastics to maintain my beliefs.

If I don't know something I'm fine admitting I don't know. If I think I know something and new evidence is found that contradicts what I think I know, then I change my mind.

I'm here to tell you I don't personally care what you choose to believe. I take the view of Thomas Jefferson who wrote ""The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. ... Reason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against error.""

BTW, I don't have any grudges against Jesus for the most part. The story of John 8:1-11 is pretty bad ass in my opinion. It is said that what he wrote in the dust were the embarrassing sins of the men who wanted to stone the adulterous woman. I'm perfectly fine with the idea of living by his moral example, I just don't buy all the supernatural stuff.

------------
“Teacher,” they said to Jesus, “this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 The law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?”

6 They were trying to trap him into saying something they could use against him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger. 7 They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, “All right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!” 8 Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust.

9 When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman. 10 Then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman, “Where are your accusers? Didn’t even one of them condemn you?”

11 “No, Lord,” she said.

And Jesus said, “Neither do I. Go and sin no more.”

>Right here, we have someone trying to point out to you some information and rather than deal with it directly, you've spun in to be attacking. 

How did I not address it directly? In fact, how could I even address them more directly? What have I spun? I don't see what information they would be giving me, I was naturally already aware of the reactions I had gotten here, I'm the one who responds to them. Them claiming that I'm the common denominator isn't information, it's their interpretation, to which I gave my counter. I provided them factual information, which is that the replies I get rarely have a connection to my actual words, people project and make up slanderous lies about me, so, if you were to look at the content this would become obvious. So why would me stating this fact be attacking?


>That is DESPITE the fact that you've made comments elsewhere that you have negative interactions with people all over the place.

I'm unclear on what you're saying here. It look like you're trying to claim that I would disagree with the idea that I get negative reactions here, but in the very next line that you left out I say I get a lot of vitriol in here. Then I make it clear why the common denominator for these reactions can't be me, but is instead the audience. Seems to me like a disconnect between your comment and what I actually said. I invite you to expand on this.

>>>You have a bias and you are fiercely defending it. Yet, you have no awareness of your own bias while you shroud yourself in ""research"" and ""logic.""

>>It made me laugh that you are deriding ""research"" and ""logic."" What would be wrong about research and logic? What bias would I have? I don't really feel like my arguments are especially fierce either, I actually consciously tone down my rhetoric even though I feel that much harsher terms would be completely justified.

>In this case, you've spun the argument to being about ""research and logic"" when that wasn't the point of the other poster's comments. Your spin is delivered with condescention but misses the discussion point (which is the fact that your information is shrouded in its own bias).

How would I be spinning anything when line-by-line I'm directly responding to what they said? They didn't point out a problem with some specific research or logic, they implied a problem with me using them at all. What bias would my information be shrouded in? What would I be missing? I asked them ""What bias would I have?"" Seems like I'm engaging them directly on their claim which you accuse me of missing. Do you disagree? 

Where would the condescension have been?

I saw your link to one from 20 days ago, which was simply someone saying thank you so not really worth the time of banning, especially since he never states that he's a client. Outside of that I haven't seen anything.

>>""Providing relevant information"" it's good that you're getting closer to admitting the real problem, which isn't that I don't have a useless degree, it's that you had a problem with the content of my comments. Below I already told you I know a person who was making simply critical comments, their comments are all still visible, and my comments were more fair than theirs as well. So now that you're being at least a little honest, tell me, why would have my comments been irrelevant?

>Here a user directly responds to a comment you made about other non-professionals posting in r/psychotherapy. They concretely rebut your argument and instead of saying ""okay, maybe you're right"" you go on to call this person's degree ""useless"" and try to redirect toward an unrelated observation on someone else's comments.

Why would their anecdotal information be a concrete rebuttal? Seems like the furthest thing from concrete. I point out evidence which shows them being wrong, how would that be me redirecting anything or be unrelated? Seems to me like direct engagement with relevant evidence. So, given that their argument was just them expressing their opinion and I could even give evidence to disprove it I'm unclear on what you think should have caused me to agree with them. I invite you to expand on your thoughts here. Currently it's not making any sense to me.

Also, calling the degree useless wasn't me making a personal attack, it was me expressing my general view about it since people claim I should have one to participate.

That labor contract laws are more well defined in Europe doesn't necessarily have any relation to the rate of economic growth. Reasons why the US might have had a higher rate of growth than Europe: large-scale immigration, greater resources, and the growth of the inhabitable parts of the country.

Also, after WWII, West Germany and Japan had phenomenal economic growth and strong worker protection, just as the US did, for that matter. Remember how popular unions were in America, at a time when you yourself admit that America grew economically? Funny how that didn't stunt growth."

"sigh, this again. No offense to you, TheProdigyLol, but this kind of short-sightedness is exactly what bugs me about r/atheism these days. Lots of atheists, whom I respect, think that the absence of God is as obvious as, well, a square versus a circle, and that they are talking to someone who, through some bizarre feats of mental gymnastics, is able to deny the obvious. But to a believer, the existence of God is just as obvious. To them, it is us that have to work hard every day to protect our minds from the obvious truth. That's why I made this version of the comic. That's exactly what we look like to Christians, because to them, God's existence is as obvious as his non-existence is to us. That both sides are unable to get past this juvenile misunderstanding prevents us from really talking about religion and faith seriously, on the same terms. Only when we can understand religion as a hugely complex philosophical, psychological, and sociological phenomenon, and not some petty mental illness or cultural throwback, can we truly demonstrate its faults."

"> Socialism is common, not state

How do you enforce ""common"" ownership without an entity that is essentially a state?

> ownership of the means of production

""Means of production"" is a meaningless term. Do you mean real property that produces personal property?

> as well as democratic control of the means of production by the workers

What happens when some workers have a disagreement with other workers about what should be done? Society collapses? Or a state-like entity (let's just call it a state) takes over?

> State ownership can technically be socialism if there is also democratic control, but many socialists (especially anarchists) are opposed to state ownership and prefer collective ownership by the people themselves.

Since 99% of property is owned by private individuals and corporations, how will this be achieved without violent action on the part of a state-like entity (let's just call it the state)?

> If the state both owns and controls the means of production, it's state capitalism, not socialism.

According to whom? Sounds like ""If it's bad, then that's called capitalism, kids! But if it's magical fairy goodness, that's SOCIALISM! Yay!!!""

> The Nazis wanted a mixed economy: part capitalist, part state capitalist. There was nothing socialist about them apart from their name and some of their early rhetoric, both of which were only used to appeal to the working class. Their policies were not in any way socialist.

Some people who call themselves anarchists oppose those things. Other people who call themselves anarchists actually have differing viewpoints and don't expect everyone who subscribes to a philosophy to share the exact same platform. Go figure!

"I'm of the opinion that pretty much anyone can find a suitable group, given that they are willing to put in the time and effort.

Friends aren't working out? Ask other people, many folks have family, schoolmates, coworkers, or other acquaintances. Ask people you don't know very well, ask people who you're sure will say no, some may surprise you. Hell, ask strangers you run into if you are comfortable with it.

Game stores are a thing. Easier with a car, but barring that there's public transportation like busses/trains, personal transportation like bicycles, and your two best locomotive friends, left foot and right foot. Plenty game stores run Adventurer's League, if public play is your thing, and you can always try to recruit players you meet into a private game. Even if AL doesn't fit your schedule, just showing up and talking to employees and patrons goes a long way.

Along with game stores, the idea of flyers comes to mind. One of the earliest ways people historically found groups was to advertise, with a little flyer ""Hey I want to do this DnD thing and need people to play with, this is what I want, this is my schedule, call me here"" with phone number rip-off bits at the bottom. Put them up in game stores, or really anywhere else that has cork boards.

And all of that hasn't even delved into the internet. Places like /r/lfg can be used to find in person games. And you can find people to play online with using Roll20 or FantasyGrounds or the archaic but ever classic message board or chat client.

I'm not saying it's easy. All of these things come with hurdles to overcome, especially for people who are introverted or experience mental illness (anxiety in particular) on a significant scale. Not every solution works for every person either, it's much tougher if you're in a particularly rural place, or have no viable transportation, or don't have internet. But there are so many options available that the vast majority of people have something they can do that they haven't done yet.

For most people, having no suitable group is not a fact of life, it's a conscious choice. And it's not a sign of failure if you don't want to do it. But a vast majority of the time, ""I can only play with my lame friends"" really means ""I can only play with my lame friends because I don't want to put in the time and energy to do the things required to find anyone else."""

The number of people I've met who lost out on opportunities because they thought it was all luck and waiting for something to fall into your lap finally VASTLY outnumbers the people who will semi-regularly go to their boss and say ""I'd like to move up. I want to be next in line when a promotion hits. How can I work on that so that in a year or two when it happens I'm the only obvious choice?""

I've met a few people in life who truly had no shot. The vast vast majority had and continue to have one. They seem to prefer having a sob story. Obviously outside of the US this changes dramatically but if you live in the US even as a lower class citizen you've got more opportunity than you probably think."

You took everything I said, and blew it out of proportion, distorting and insulting. You assigned assumptions to me that I did not voice, and proceeded to bash away. To be perfectly honest, these are the tactics I usually only encounter when debating with the religious.


You're right, this is my first submission to the r/atheism... and I was immediately set upon with rants and vulgarity.


Other people don't live in the secular utopia I do? My word, I never would have imagined that, having spent my last four years being taught by priests and calmly debating evolution, homosexuality, and the origins of morality, for the ten thousandth time. 


How dare I be so ""goddamn petty and presumptuous"" to mention my surprise that, despite being surrounded by many deeply religious people, I have not encountered the aggressive fanaticism and stupidity that others have here. 


How dare I voice my perspective on the quality of content here. It's almost as though I believe I have the right to an opinion. 


You have it tough? I sympathize. Do not assume a relative lack of religious zealotry makes for an ""enlightened"" area, and do not assume I look down upon you because I question the value of a facebook screengrab. 


And before you respond with more bile, perhaps you should consider that there are 150K subscribers here. This is one of the largest atheist forums on the web, and people do read it. You are the face of atheism for many. Everyone needs to vent, but perhaps the next time you feel the need to cuss someone out, you can do so where others won't read and think ""so that's what an atheist, presented with an opposing opinion, looks like.""


Might there be more constructive ways of venting than letting us all know for the seventh time what the high school drop out next door put up as his status?

"> It seems like everyone is part of these chains and there are no more independents left.

I don't think you really understand how the industry works, bud. To be successful as an independent you typically need to have a large enough book of business that you can afford things like office space and admin on your own. Even the ""independent"" advisors need to clear their business through somebody, so the guys you think are truly independent are, for example, LPL advisors. 

What this means for you is that it seems you are on the younger side and accumulating wealth as you are entering peak earning years, yes? If so, you're likely a C-list client to a bigger independent adviisor.

What to do? Honestly, find someone you like and could see yourself working with, be he at a wire house (Merrill, Morgan, Ray Jay, etc.) or even on the retail banking channel (could be a nice person doing securities at your bank). Possibly ask a trusted friend or co-worker for a referral. Bonus if any are CPAs or attorneys who do estate planning, as they are in similar professional circles as advisors. 

Call the dude up, book a coffee meeting, and explain what you are working towards. If you like him, you can look him up on FINRA broker check to see if he has any complaints or felonies or whatever. Might be that even if he works for a wire house or bank now, if he builds up a large enough book of business, he'll go ""independent"" some day as well, and clear through Pershing or Schwab, meaning the name on your statement changes, but little else.

thing is, because of the two-party system, you guys live in a fake dualtiy of right vs. left. two opposing extremes. there is no middle way. its either/or, there is no 'as well as' possible.

that split is programmed, not natural. and although you have good reasoning for opposing 'the left' - because you are right, the constitutional republic needs to be re-installed -, labeling everybody who wants some more social security a 'leftie' and name them in one breath with the swamp is 'divide and conquer' BS.

It also doesn't help that the 1500-2000 number is what most FAs use as a ""guideline"" for their ""supposed calorie intake"" and argue that any lower than the recommended guidelines, they gain weight. There are uncountable amounts of posts with bloggers telling their followers to eat 2000kcal ignoring factors like height, weight, age. 

I believe some of the women in this subreddit live on 1200/day? and some men 1500. As long as you account for metabolic adaptation, in other words, a decrease in BMR during and after weight loss, then CICO applies and you'll still maintain or lose weight accordingly. I'll hazard a guess and say most of the redditors here lose weight successfully and maintained it without ever accounting for metabolic adaptation or they did and didn't know it.

">Women are a numerical majority in most countries in the world.

Which means absolutely nothing in power politics where men hold almost all the power.

>The notion to treat a majority group as a ""minority"" is a very recent and contentious sociological construct.

You don't understand the term ""minority"" do you? Let me give you a hint: The literal definition of the word doesn't always have to be correct. The native Filipinos outnumbered their Spanish conquerors greatly, yet they were still a minority because they were abused and exploited. The Francophones in Quebec heavily outnumbered the Anglophones, yet the Anglophones controlled the province until the Silent Revolution in the 1960s.

Being in the majority did not make these groups any less minorities to have their rights trampled by another dominant group.

>sociological construct.

No, really? It would be pretty absurd is we used an astrophysical or entomological construct for what is basically a sociological phenomenon, would it not?

Do you go around diagnosing people in the psych ward based on geology too?

>This is impossible to answer without deciding on a definition of power first.

"I think you are a bit misguided.

>What do you mean by re-balancing then? When most say it they are speaking about rebalancing in different asset classes. I suppose if you have international and domestic equity then you can rebalance, but even then 100% domestic equity has produced the best returns historically.

So first of all, yes I am referring to rebalancing different asset classes within equity. One example, like you said, is having domestic and international equity. But you can also invest in different funds that are all domestic. You can rebalance within your domestic equity if you want.

Also another point, just because domestic returns have been better historically, does not mean at all they will be better going forward. It makes sense to think that some developing country could develop a lot in the future, which would yield good stock returns.

>Having diversification and rebalancing lowers return for a disproportionate reduction in risk. It does not raise return.

No. Rebalancing raises returns. It forces you to buy low and sell high. Stocks could be worth the same 50 years from now as they are today, but if you rebalance during it's volatility, you will have made far more returns.

I agree with you that investing all in one asset has the potential to have the greatest return, but nobody knows what asset that is. As such, most people will come out ahead by diversifying and rebalancing."

>In order for you to defend your assertion that the US is susceptible to the exact kind of infiltration that France was, you have to demonstrate that the US's refugee/immigration process (one of the strictest on the planet) is equally easy to navigate through than France's.

"Well, since Buddhism in general is a hard path, I don't see anything strange about the majority of members quitting, and I don't really think that says much about the practice either way.

And of COURSE you can achieve your goals and determinations without Nichiren Buddhism. I don't think anything is a one size fits all--it is just an ""expedient means"" that suits some people and not others--there are many expedient means, and many different paths to enlightenment. 

And as for positive visualization making you more likely to fail--well... both yes and no, depending on how the visualization is done. When you engage in pure positive visualization and just bask in the glow of your imagined future success, and leave it at that--yes, you are absolutely right, studies have shown that this can be counterproductive. The scientific explanation I read is that your mind/body, on the most basic level, can't tell the difference between an imagined experience and a real experience. When you actually achieve a goal, your body releases a little hit of dopamine, which leads to the pleasurable feelings of reward. When you just visualize achieving the goal then, you still get that little hit of dopamine, and get some of that positive feeling of reward--but without actually doing the work. Because you already got some of the reward you were seeking, but without having to expend effort, this leaves you less motivated to achieve than before. (This is a super over-simplified explanation). BUT, if you visualize yourself achieving your goal and then make sure to CONTRAST it to the undesirable situation of the way things are now, it causes this hit of dopamine to then be countered by the chemicals that produce more negative feelings. What happens then, is that you associate achieving your goal with the feeling of pleasure, but you are immediately reminded of your dissatisfaction with the current state of things. This mental contrast, as opposed to pure positive visualization, has been shown to INCREASE motivation and effectiveness. (This research was cited in the book The Procrastination Equation, which was a recent, popular book by a research psychologist on the subject of defeating procrastination. It delved into areas like increasing motivation and willpower, how to effectively change habits, how to get yourself to work effectively towards achieving your goals, etc.--and it presented research to back up the strategies it recommended. 

As for the practical benefits of mindfulness in increasing happiness, helping to modulate emotions, improving ""distress tolerance"" (the ability to withstand very painful negative emotions without resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms like escapism, regression, denial, etc.). Mindfulness (which is usually practiced/rehearsed by regular practice of various meditation techniques) seems to be of value in improving overall life effectiveness, see research on Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness Based Therapy--two newer forms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that are considered to be ""Evidence Based Treatments"" (meaning they have science to back their effectiveness). As chanting a mantra is an established meditative technique in MANY religions and philosophies, I don't see how chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo would not have the same benefits that other forms of meditation seem to provide. Research suggests that regular meditation slows cognitive decline, increases neuroplasticity reduces stress, and reduces the symptoms of depression and anxiety, among other positive benefits. If for nothing else than THAT, the practice would have a positive effect.

I also don't see how a philosophy that has you take responsibility for yourself and for the consequences of your own actions is a negative one?And as I mentioned before, having this ""inner locus of control""--is believed to reduce levels of depression, and increase your likelihood of achieving your goals. (There is extensive research on this, too--it is one of those concepts that is included in just about every psych textbook.)

I am genuinely curious as to why you are so negative about the SGI? Look, I'm not pushing the religion. I honestly don't care if others practice or not-- to each his own--...

I mean, I was raised Catholic. Catholicism isn't for me, but my mother is quite devout, and more power to her if it makes her happy,,,I feel the same way about Nichiren Buddhism and the SGI

I am curious as to what harm the SGI did to you, and how the religion hurt you so much that you feel compelled to denounce it and be a ""whistleblower""?

BTW--studies show that 95% of people who join AA quit as well, but for the 5% of people who stay, it works great. Its kind of one of those ""it works for the people it works for"" situations, and that is how I see the SGI.

I also think that whether the SGI helps you improve your life, or whether it leads to self-delusion, ineffectiveness and stagnation, largely depends on your mindset and how you interpret the philosophy--and also on whether you actually put the teachings into action or you just passively expect chanting alone to fix everything...basically, I think it comes down to whether you walk the walk or just talk the talk

Like, I have this friend in the practice who chants for a couple hours a day, and has done so for 20 years, and he was just complaining to me recently, not understanding why he wasn't getting any benefits, wondering why his life sucked so much...the thing is, he chants a lot, but he taes NO positive action. He makes bad causes constantly, creating terrible consequences for himself. If you aren't even going to try to LIVE by the principle that what you do now creates your future, then why in the hell would you bother chanting ""devotion to the mystical law of Karma"" over and over again? After all, you are proving by your negative actions that you are not devoted to the concept of Karma in the least!!

Hey, I know people that have had 20 years of therapy and are no better off--that doesn't mean that therapy doesn't work! it just means that they haven't been willing to put in the necessary effort to MAKE it work, OR that that partcular form of therapy is not right for them...well, I feel it is the same with the SGI...

I admit to being a very troubled person. I have had A LOT of problems in the past, and I STILL have problems--the thing is that practicing Nichiren Buddhism seems to have helped me reduce my problems in severity and number, and to me that is a huge win. 

BTW--Honestly, I mostly don't even practice with the SGI, although I am a member. I mainly just practice as an independent Nichiren Buddhist. So I guess I am much more devoted to the actual philosophy than to the specific group/organization of the SGI...

"That's not making anything up, that's me speaking(albeit a little subjectively if you really want to get technical) of how the nature of battle threads are. Next.

Once again, this example that you're giving is still not showing me making anything up. But I will reply to it and explain my reasoning behind the whole ""x>y"" argument. Certain characters can have glaring weaknesses and can lose certain battles for a multitude of reasons. These reasons can make a huge difference in the context of a battle. For example, Kakashi beat Obito, right? Now, does this mean that Kakashi would also beat Guy, Naruto, and Killer Bee combined? No, most likely not. But since Kakashi beat Obito(context is apparently irrelevant here), he should be able to do the same thing that Obito did, right? That's exactly where the problem lies in those kinds of lists. I figure, if a character is so absolutely better than another in you eyes, then why not just argue about it using feats and evidence? If you're so sure Madara would win, why haven't you made a solid argument yet?

DMS Kakashi feats are similarly applicable to Obito, considering that Obito was the reason why Kakashi was able to use the DMS. Everything I argue for DMS Obito, I can support with manga feats and I can in fact thoroughly explain why it's applicable if you so wish, just call me out on whatever it is that you doubt. Now, compare this, to the fact that you have no argument whatsoever concerning Madara. 

Just as you said I'm guessing, you're guessing right here. The truth is, we can't be certain. But tell me why Kamui wouldn't work? Kamui allows the user to phase through objects as shown various times in the manga, why is Amaterasu an exception. If you can explain why it wouldn't work, then I'll concede this argument, but until then, you have nothing. 

Obito doesn't have to be better than Madara at tai, nin, or genjutsu. He only needs Kamui to win, and you still haven't proven that wrong. But even so, Obito is on par with Madara in terms of ninjutsu. I can explain why if you so wish.

First off, Madara can't speed blitz him. A half dead Obito that was being controlled by Black Zetsu was able to block two TSBs, Madara is at most on par with the speed of a TSB or perhaps even slower. As a matter of fact, Obito was faster than Madara in that same chapter as well. Remember when Madara tried to take out his Rinnegan? Obito activated Kamui before he could grab it. Madara cannot speed blitz Obito. And you also seem to keep misunderstanding, Obito is going use Kamui on Madara to kill him. Obito has both eyes, meaning all he has to do is look at Madara for less than a second and the fight's over. 

downgraded shinobi skills don't matter in this fight, I don't know why you're brining them up. We're arguing Madara vs DMS Obito. Nothing else, don't bring up any other hypothetical situations for the fight other than that. 

Like I said, if you want to debate Hashirama vs. Obito, go make a post about it and send me the link. I will not speak further on this subject here in this thread. 

Now, if you would kindly finally construct an argument, I'd be happy to have an actual debate with you. "

">A simple perusal of this sub shows most practitioners are, in fact, more acutely aware of their emotions.

This is a temporary state. I consistently see people on this sub imagining that the results of a few hundred hours of meditation or less produces the same results as a few thousand hours. Most people on this sub are novice meditators and they extrapolate from their current experiences what things will be like if they continue. It's like the person saying ""I drink coke occasionally and I'm perfectly healthy therefore if I drink 20 cokes a day for 10 years I'm going to be in exactly the same situation"". This makes no logical sense.

>It isn't changing your feelings and emotions, it is changing your relationship to them.

I'm sorry, but you don't understand how the process works. If you've done any serious meditation you'll notice that you'll randomly experience different emotions. They come out of nowhere and have no relation to your current situation. This is due to the fact meditation is a purging process. It is delving into your subconscious and pulling emotions out of you. 

After a while, situations that provoked certain emotions in you won't be as intense and will be much more fleeting. You're not simply observing your emotions and not being attached, you're actually feeling less emotion in the same situation. This is a progressive process and continues the more meditation you do because meditation is draining your subconscious.

It really concerns me that so many westerners have this romanticized notion of meditation because the reality of it is too antithetical to our way of thinking. The concept of non-attachment when taken literally is too bleak so people put a spin on it to make it more palatable. This leads people to get involved in something where they do not fully understand the consequences. I say this as someone who has done exactly that so I've been as ignorant as most people. 

This guy has apparently done over 10000 hours of meditation in his life and explains his current state as non-thinking state of stillness where he doesn't experience the typical emotional responses anymore. He actually describes the process of getting to that state involved letting go of all his attachments, even the attachment to his own daughters. He doesn't just have a slightly different perspective on his emotions and attachments, meditation has fundamentally changed his experience of life. The end result of years of meditation practice has little relation to what you experience after a few hundred hours "

"I guess my opinion is that yes prep is a good thing but I DO think it's overrated and over-used. And if medical companies want to start pushing it, they have to be more responsible about communicating its purpose.


I think many people who WOULD use a condom would turn to prep instead of condoms if we start campaigning for it and marketing it toward the gay community. ALREADY in the US many gay people think they SHOULD be on prep JUST BECAUSE they are gay and have sex, which is BAD communication to me. Also there is so much misconception in the gay community about hiv. I think prep exploits that fear. There are too many gay guys turning to prep simply because it's trendy and they're super afraid of HIV to an extreme degree when A) wearing a condom is effective and B) Prep does not protect you from ANY OTHER DISEASE and thus should be used with a condom anyway!!


The medical community needs to be clearer about prep. IT was basically designed for irresponsible people (which statistically there are a lot in the gay community when it comes to sex) as a backup resort. I think THOSE people should take prep. But I think OTHERWISE responsible condom wearers, especial future ones who are young now, but are coming of gay age in the era of prep will now resort to irresponsbible behavior (i.e. using prep without a condom, when they otherwise would if prep didn't exist). So my problem with it it is when the medical community and gay community start exploiting people's ignorance about hiv, prep and condoms to create a culture of trend in which prep is seen as the first and best resort OVER or IN LIEU of condom usage."

I never said allegations against Trump are suspicious as fuck. Trump was never my choice of candidate and I didn't vote for him. I opposed Roy ""Forever 14"" Moore.

>Conservatives have a long long long history of not giving a single fuck about women, sexual assault or rape. 

Neither have Democrats, as evidence by them supporting just as many rapists and sexual assaulters. You seem to be making the case that this is one-sided, where only Republicans are guilty of sexual assault and the Democrats never do such things. I'm saying it goes on both sides and each side makes a big deal out of it when the other party does it, but tries to ignore it when it's their guy.

That list is just as long for Democrats, which you seem to be ignoring. This is what makes you a partisan hack.

>""false claims""....ooh look more lies.

You must work for CNN. I said ""likely false claims."" You chose only to quote ""false claims."" Who's the lying piece of shit now?

>So if a women is raped and it was a long time ago it doesn't matter. 

Now you're putting words into my mouth. More lying. I'm comparing a distant allegation to allegations today. Generally more recent behavior is more important. If Obama snorted coke 20 years before he ran for President or snorted coke 2 weeks before the election, would that different time frame matter? If Ted Kennedy drove a woman off a bridge in 1995 instead of 1969, do you not think it would be a bigger deal in the late 1990's? So the time, while not everything, is a component of this. Normally, the media would focus on the most recent alleged bad behavior, but they're not, and it's largely for partisan reasons.

"Rape culture isn't hard to explain, and shouldn't be hard for someone with basic mental competency to fully understand. It is an environment within culture where it is seen as normal for men to feel entitled to objectifying females as sexual objects which leads to de-humanizing of women as sex objects and lesser-than. Men, within rape culture, are taught that to be men they are supposed to take what they want from women and not feel bad about it. Females are shown time and time again that if they come forth to confront their attacker they are just attacked all over again by those who tell them they must have been asking for it, etc. So you have both men and women with a warped view of sexuality and their roles within it.

"You know what? You're being pretty rude. I'm just posting what my experience has been with the GS weapons based on my own kill times as a lonehunter on 3DS, and what I've seen around the web.

But if you want solid numbers, here they are:

 http 

With Crit Draw and Sharpness +1, Nero's Anguish and Cera Cymmetry are pretty much tied for the best Greatswords.

No circumstantial info, no playstyle involved. Raw numbers.

Myxo Demolisher is still a great weapon for early-mid G-Rank, but Nero and Cera are better. Pretty much every single forum post, discussion, guide and game story, agree on those two weapons.

And look, no trash talking!

EDIT: after reading beyond all that tryhard speech, you are putting a lot of words in my mouth. 

First of all, Slime has a CHANCE to proc with each attack. Of course you CAN have more procs with the right skills, leading to more explosions on certain quests. That's just a statistical fluctuation. Cherry-picking two videos as a proof isn't conclusive at all. Again, I proposed 2-3 blows per quest as a rough estimate for all the grinding I've done with my own Myxo Demolisher.

Second, YOU started talking about speedrunning. Again, speed killing heavily depends on your playstyle, but in GENERAL TERMS (as I said), faster weapons which can exploit idle times, elemental weaknesses and/or status are better for speedrunning than Myxo Demolisher as a solo hunter, specially because monsters build resistance to Slime the more you apply to them. That means less frequent explosions for a weapon with the same damage potential. I proposed Spectral Demolisher as the best Brachydios weapon for this, NOT as the best speedrunning weapon. Also, stop cherry-picking videos over Youtube. Isolated cases aren't proof of a statistical tendency.

Third, Cera Cymmetry needs Crit Draw because the skill adds 100 affinity to your seathed attacks, that means that instead of having a 20% chance of whiffing your Seathed Attack (and considerably lowering your burst damage potential), you have an 80% chance of dealing insane damage with that same seathed attack.

Finally, my final statement about consistently landing lvl 3 Seathed Attacks isn't me being ""full of shit"", is the bread-and-butter Greatsword tactic and what every single Greatsword player says to new Greatsword wielders all around the Internet. It's no secret that consistently landing those sweet lvl 3 attacks increases your damage output by a landslide, and at the end of the quest they give more overall damage than simply smashing the X and A buttons alternately like if you were weaving a flag.

EDIT 2: Here is a nice spreadsheet put together by our own /r/MonsterHunter with the best Blademaster weapons and recommended skills. Calm down, champ: all the weapons discussed by both of us are here."

"> We're already forced to make assumptions regardless of what we believe just to plan out our day. This is an argument for ignorance. 

I didn't make any argument. I noted that you're setting the frame for a presumption of materialism, which makes it perhaps too easy to conclude materialism.

>The existence of imaginary numbers is inferred based on the existence of real numbers

The key thing is inferred. Great. They were inferred that way. But they were not observed. The existence of imaginary numbers is not predicated on real numbers existing. One could imagine any number of other routes by which they could be discovered. And they are discovered, not invented.

Likewise, Pi would be an irrational number even if humans had never existed. It's existence is a transcendent truth, knowable through reason, not through observation.

These are objective truths, and truths more certain than any observation of the real world. As I said before, this would be impossible if the truth of mathematical proofs was predicated on observations, as they would be strictly less than or equal to the reliability of the observations.

>You're misapplying your terms.

I'm not the one who said ""Argument from Ignorance"" when one's grounds for an argument were pointed out.

>Its not objectively true in and of itself.

It is. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment about aliens. Math is often thought to be a universal language. When communicating with the stars, we look for things like prime numbers and so forth as a means by which to see an artificial signal. But since their development must be by definition alien to ours, why is it that we expect that we would be able to talk through math?

The answer is that math is discovered, not invented.

> You can be certain of the math, but that doesn't mean the math absolutely applies. You're looking at this problem backwards. 

You're agreeing with me here. We are more certain that 2+2 = 4 than having it apply to the real world.

>You can't know in things outside of the universe because you don't exist there nor can you produce reliable measurements of it. 

...and there's the payoff from the presupposition I called out in my opening paragraph. 

I will absolutely agree with you that if all there is to knowledge is empirical observation, as you imply with your ""reliable measurements"", then we can have no knowledge of things outside the universe.

But as we've seen, this is not actually the case. We can deduce the existence of things outside of the universe, in much the same way that you claimed we can infer imaginary numbers from real numbers!

>Your the one attacking reason based on evidence by purporting indeterminate conjecture as if it constitutes proof
 
Conjecture is not proof. Please do not confuse the two.

If I prove that 2+2 = 4 under, say, ZFC set theory, then I have proven it. It is not conjecture. 

I suppose you might try to dismiss a proof that you don't like as conjecture, but this is an irrational line of attack. If a proof is provided to you, you can attack the premises, or you can attack the line of reasoning. You can't just say that because it's a proof, it is conjecture, as you do here. These are not the same things.

>You can't make claims up from scratch and claim they're valid

Not true. Validity is can be quite easy to demonstrate using terms I just made up:

All A are B. 
All B are C. 
Therefore, all A are C.

Perhaps you meant to say soundness?

>Stating that god is timeless and eternal is not a rational or logical claim in any sense of those terms. 

Is is the conclusion, not an assumption. So this argument doesn't apply.

>And without evidence, neither side can know. 

A logical proof is a form of evidence. And a more certain one than the empirical observations that you seem to be in a monogamous relationship with.

>I'd say its ironic that you, a theist, is trying to re-frame the terms evidence and knowledge in order to purport your fake knowledge

Evidence and knowledge have definitions. Evidence is something that can be used to support a claim. An argument is a claim supported by evidence. Knowledge is a true justified belief(). And so forth.

Nowhere in those definitions does the fine print read, ""...and only reliable measurements are allowed"".

This absurd insistence that a form of evidence, with only modest levels of confidence, is the only form of evidence is not only a logical fallacy you make, but is the cancerous irrationality that lurks at the heart of modern atheism. 

>Logic is not divine providence! If your argument can't stand up on its own merit, then it shouldn't. This quote describes your failure, not mine. There's no reason outside of your cognitive dissonance to believe in an archaic faerie tale. And asserting that as truth or evidence is a blatant lie. The terms you're using mean the exact opposite of how you're applying them. You're actually describing something that theists do, not atheists, to justify their silly beliefs. You're conflating the boundary between words and actions so that anything you feel seems plausible by purporting a mind before matter argument. But that's an egocentric defense mechanism. Just because you need to believe something doesn't make it real. And you've still skirted around the original question refused to support why you think ""god is eternal and timeless,"" actually constitutes knowledge. Without evidence, its no more valid than believing in unicorns. 

This entire paragraph is a classic example of someone working through cognitive dissonance. You think you're a smart person, but your thought system isn't apparently capable of understanding how a logical proof could be used to support a claim, despite that being, the definition of what a proof is. So you spin out these elaborate fantasies and project your image of an idealized deranged theist onto your internet conversation with me.

"You said my argument is the kind of thinking that given us the worst traffic in the country. That's bullshit and it's just completely backwards.

Your argument for Tukwila is a great example. People could walk there if there was housing instead of a parking lot. So I'm saying we should avoid that mistake at future stations by building housing instead.

The misinformation lies in the premise of your argument that every car there is one less car on the freeway. That analysis is so simplistic and incomplete as to be useless, and it misleads by ignoring complexities. How did they get to the station? On the freeway? How would they have traveled otherwise? What is their destination? If they had to pay for parking would they ride the bus to the station? What if there was no parking at all? 

The larger point is that if we want future stations to avoid that fate, we must invest in transit oriented development instead of catering to people in suburbs already. Again, the parking in Tukwila makes traffic worse, not better. It doesn't matter if it's only local traffic; no traffic is truly local and congestion aggregates in non-linear ways all over the region.

What I'm saying is that the way we make walking to these stations easier is to encourage the development of housing in close proximity. Our failure to do that in Tukwila is a great example of why we need to do as I suggest. I hear you on upzoning and agree that it's an essential component. 

That we're not building where people live is misinformation too, not because it's technically false but because it completely misses the point. We're trying to influence future land use patterns to avoid replicating the same mistakes. 

Congestion is a fact of life in a big city, so the solution has less to do with addressing it than it does investing in alternatives. As long as our economy is good and people move here, we will always have traffic. 

You argued that if we want to improve transit we need to find a way to pay for parking. That's simply not the case. More parking will make traffic worse faster and do nothing to address regional transportation concerns in the long term."

"> So how do you judge who, individually, produces the most profit? By what system is that measured and who determines how it is measured?

Profit is revenue minus costs: a pretty simple idea. Now obviously such calculations can become very complicated very quickly, but that's up for each business owner to figure out; and if they screw it up, they suffer an economic penalty. 

> Blockbuster and Borders and Kodak... Yeah. Major players.

In their respective fields, yes. Each was was several hundred million to several billion dollars. 

> Tell me who among the following is failing due to competition:

What exactly is this list? What is your point? 

Of those, I know Lehman failed a few years back, and several of the American banks received bailout money. Of course, the fact that this many large banks exist means it is completely impossible for the situation you described, where the existing players lower prices whenever a competitor tries to enter the market, to occur. 

> You have yet to provide any other metric other than some vague notion of who individually produces ""more"" profit for the company.

Excuse me? Profit is precisely mathematically defined. When it comes to individuals in a large corporation, the profit any given person is responsible for may be difficult to calculate, but that does not make the concept of profit at all ill-defined. 

> Even if you were able to provide some mechanism of measuring that, I'd have to ask who the one holding the measuring stick is and how this might affect the decision of who does ""more.""

This statement doesn't mean anything in the context of a private firm, because it's not your business and not my business what someone else does with their money in a voluntary contract with other free people. Moreover, it is in the best interest of the owners and supervisors of the employed to be as accurate as possible. Any error results in economic loss. 

Also, profit is a real number. Putting quotation marks around ""more"" with regards to profit makes it seem like you don't know what ""<"" and "">"" mean. 
 
> And without human labor of some kind, there'd be no food. You've got to hunt, you've got to gather, you've got to farm.

And without food of some kind, there'd be no labor. You've got to develop for nine months, be born, and grow up for several years, consuming food the whole time, before you can even start to labor. 

We can continue this indefinitely, as I pointed out several posts ago. The more you repeat yourself, the more you demonstrate that you didn't read my post, are more interested in repeating your own view than actually addressing criticism, and don't get the point. 

Let's simplify for a minute. Say we want to define value to be labor, in some measurement. In mathematics and logic, if A is defined as B, then A and B are logically equivalent: A iff B. In other words, A is both necessary and sufficient for B. So are labor and value equivalent? 

Obviously Marx defined ""value"" a certain way. But what would we expect ""value"" to mean intuitively? Something has value iff it has some sort of use, be it consumption or trade. A good has nonzero value <==> there exists a person who can consume the good for positive utility. This sort of makes sense even in LTV: a worker who produces 0 value (or destroys value) consistently is rather rare, and the entire point of consuming labor to produce a good is so that your product has some use, to someone, somewhere. 

Well, is labor sufficient for value? Couldn't be. Labor alone cannot produce any matter because it is an expenditure of energy at too low of a level to be condensed into matter. Acting on a vacuum will produce vacuum, which is exactly what you had before. 

If labor input into a good were sufficient input to create a good with nonzero value, we should be able to take a naked human or group of humans, in a lightless vacuum, and their labor would produce a good with nonzero value. Seems impossible to me, got any ideas? 

Is it necessary? This would be asserting that nobody every got any utility out of something unless someone put work into it. Did people put any work into the air before we breathed it? Clearly not. Is air useful? Yes. Thus labor is not value. 

> Food fails as a measurement of value because, while we may have means of measuring how many calories are burned in physical labor, we don't have a way of measuring equivalent mental labor, which certainly doesn't burn calories like swinging a sledgehammer does. I know you really love your brilliant ""food value"" thing, but it creates a false analogy.

I didn't bring up calories, that was you. And we can measure value with exactly the same precision as with LTV: the amount of ""socially necessary food production"" required to produce some amount of labor on average, is the value of that labor. Food is necessary for labor: this statement is at least as obvious as ""labor is necessary for production.""

On the contrary, food value is a terrible theory. I'm only using to how (one of the reasons) why LTV is terrible. I could make water theory of value, or oxygen theory of value, as well, because these are all necessary inputs of labor. 

Analogies are not false or true, they are more or less accurate."

"> ""yea give me Chinese world leadership over US"" never realizing that US human rights record is 1000x better than China'

Domestically US is slightly better (Americans really need to read up on the sheer massacres of natives, drug testing on minorities, heck you guys claim to be a democracy but the minorities didn't even have the same voting rights till the 60's). I as a non-American don't honestly care about that, much like the rest of the world. We are more concerned with how America behaves with others, and compared to America, Chinese 'aggression' in foreign affairs is nothing. 

I may be in my 20's but I have lived in various countries around the world (inlcluding the US), but I have travelled to various geopolitical conflict zones, and interacted with people from around the world, so I understand the complexity of geopolitics to a large extent. I am not saying the US should completely recede, but an increased Chinese role globally will be better off for many non-Western countries. For much of the developing/emerging world (so majority of the planet) China's tool of foreign policy is money, development & projects. America's tool is invasions, drones, airstrikes. Although, America is still immensely able to exert its soft-power through Hollywood, American clothing brands, food chains etc....but that is changing with regards to China as well. Ten years back 'Made in China' meant some cheap, poorly assembled, knockoff.....now it's hard to find anything that is not made in China, plus China has also given birth to global premium brands. 

>everywhere and under our hegemony the world is by far exponentially more peaceful, progressive and stable than it has ever been. EVER.

"> TIL: my Greek professors were wrong when they taught me that ἀδελφοὶ is plural of ἀδελφός, meaning brother...

I don't know who taught you Greek, but I think there is a pretty good chance they would be embarrassed to read your comment. Here's what's wrong:

1. Words almost never have a one-to-one overlap in meaning between languages. Brother is the closest English equivalent to the Greek word ἀδελφός, but they are not one-and-the-same. ἀδελφός also refers to cousins, nephews, etc. 
2. Plurals do not necessarily have the exact same meaning as singulars. This happens it Greek, in Hebrew, and even occasionally in English. Wood refers to the material from a tree, while woods are a small group of trees. Meaning aways comes from usage, not etymology or morphology.
3. ἀδελφοὶ, in the passages in question refers to mixed gender groups. No one (to my knowledge) disputes this. Brothers is never used to refer to mixed gender groups in contemporary English, so using it to translate ἀδελφοὶ in that context is just a bad translation, full stop. Now, I do think that there is a reasonable case to be made that given the NASB's translation philosophy of using single English words for Greek/Hebrew words, trying to preserve as much of the gramatical structure as possible, and producing awkward English phrasing, they probably should have used siblings instead of brothers and sisters. But, that is a seperate discussion.

">Sure, but critiquing the PRACTICE is MUCH different from vaguely associating the name with nasty things -- wouldn't you agree?

Please tell me how one would critique the practice then? The Gurus made it clear that in their opinion, a Hindu who did things with devoutness or a Muslim that did things with devoutness, was in agreement with them. They’ve made it clear that they view all humanity as one. It is absolute balderdash to make them have to censor themselves while critiquing practices that were practiced by Hindus and Muslims at the time. Most of the fiercest critiques of Hindus and Muslims found in the Guru Granth Sahib anyway comes from Hindus and Muslim saints themselves. See Kabir’s or Namdev’s writings. Bulleh Shah isn’t in the GGS, but is also a Muslim that primarily criticized it-you guessed it, practices of Muslims! Here in the subreddit, we routinely criticize practices of Sikhs and encourage open discussions on aspects of Sikhi.

>but now that we have arrived in the future -- given the associations, and the way human minds associate ideas -- do you really think it's helpful to say ""don't mock brides, because we're all subservient to God in the same way that brides are subservient to others -- haha, get it, we're all His brides?"" when what we're really trying to say is that we are all subordinates of God, and that there's nothing wrong with being subordinate in general

Why in the future? What you’re doing is reducing Sikh philosophy to a minimum to avoid any type of critical thinking in the text. Might as well say The Odyssey is “about a man lost in the sea, the end.” If you want a reduced version of all Sikh principles, here it is: ""One Universal Creator. The Name Is Truth. Manifests itself in its creation. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace.” It’s the mool mantar. If you want a slightly more expository on that, look at the Jap Ji. If you want the largest expansion, look at the GGS. 

I have to guess that you’re not a fan of poetry or literary devices at all then? That everything must be cut and dry? What’s the point? If you’re simplifying it so that it’s more accessible to people…you have to realize that the very people you’re targeting won’t be pleased you are modifying it, mainly because you have no authority to do so. 

>Don't we run the risk of encouraging the lasting perception that brides are inferior in order to help our ""ironic"" ""joke"" make sense?

Any type of literature runs risk. Doesn’t 1984 run the risk of giving actual totalitarian governments ideas for how to implement their tyranny? In the real world, people try to educate others-dumbing down everything just isn’t practical and doesn’t work. 

> If you stereotype Muslims as people who absolutely must bury their dead -- which some Muslims may not strictly observe, as they also take inevitable liberties in the interpretation of their book of guidance -- and a Muslim is offended by it -- as in the story of Ram Rai -- then that proves beyond a doubt that there was a possibility for offensive stereotyping, and that this possibility actualized, as a matter of fact

Oh come on now. It’s an Islamic practice. Sure, there may be Muslims that don’t bury their dead, there may very well also be Muslims that don’t believe in God and are cultural Muslims. Again, welcome to literature and communication 101.

>The fact that ""bad people might make bad changes"" is no kind of valid reason for good people to refrain from making good changes. Yes, good people may make mistakes -- and that's why discussions like this are important -- but that doesn't mean they should ""keep their hands off"" just because they don't want to make any bad things worse.
Question, how do we know that you’re a “good person”? It’s food for thought. You very well, hell we all could, be liberal westerners trying to push their personal ideology onto Sikh theology for the purpose of swaying people a certain way politically. It’s about setting a precedent. Discussions like this are very important, but modifying the text opens a nasty door that the Gurus specifically set out to prevent. I hope you realize that most patriarchs and such thought that they were doing “the right thing” too; in fact, everybody does. It’s why it’s key to look at a text objectively over inserting our own words into the Gurus’ mouth.
 
>IF we must satire practices that are commonly associated with Islam -- in my opinion, of course -- we should satire the PRACTICE, NOT the religion taken as a whole, or a follower taken in a certain way.

Again, they go hand in hand in the shabad. There are other shabads that give plenty of context for as to how human race is one, and how in the Gurus’ eyes, “true” Muslims are those that are purely devout in their practice and shun from ritualism. You are isolating one shabad from the entire GGS, which is why your argument is in many ways flawed.

>I am criticizing assertions of the Guru Granth Sahib -- but you have not once heard me criticize a Sikh, or talk about what Sikhs are generally like.

we’re not a bloc, but people do it all the time. We do it to ourselves, regarding our hypocrisy on certain practices. It’s a common occurrence on the sub. Ideological labels are not racial or cultural labels. They go hand in hand, and are often blurred, but they are considered separate things. 

>Yes, actually. I think that John Stewart's show would be FAR more educational -- FAR more informative -- if he refrained from ALL simplistic, reductionist critiques of the form

Then we fundamentally disagree on what satire is. For the matter, Jon Stewart doesn’t say what you say. He does, however, use the labels of ideological when it’s practical to do so. “Republicans believe in economic free markets” may not apply to every Republican, but it’s a part of their party line on their own website and applies to a majority. It’s not a cultural or racial identity; it’s an ideoglocial one. "

Do they proclaim themselves to be ""the platform of the alt-right""? Or did you just hear someone else say that about them?

He wrote an article about the alt-right. The WSJ did as well. The NYT did as well. Still waiting for a quote or article where he claims to represent them.

>The cameraman is employed by Breitbart. So yeah, that's a ""sign if political support"".

No it's not, actually. Richard Lewis used to WRITE for Breitbart and wasn't even a fervent right winger, let alone part of ""the alt-right"", let alone a racist nationalist nazi or whatever you think these people are. 

This is a CAMERAMAN. He doesn't even need to have political opinions. His answer to every political question could be him drooling all over himself.

Yes, he's a bit edgy. What's your point here? That because he's known to say offensive things, everyone who's aware of that wouldn't go see a talk of his because that's too much for them to handle? I mean, what?

I disagree with Milo on nearly every point of political policy because I'm left-leaning, especially on social issues. Yet I could see myself going to see a talk of his, especially if someone I knew was also attending. Curious how that immediately refutes the implied sentiment that at every Milo talk, the room must be filled with people who think exactly like him. 

>Just as I'm sure you don't care that Breitbart spreads hateful conspiracy theories that lead people to shoot up pizza parlors.

What an incredibly stupid assumption. Why would you think I don't care about that? Even if I were on Breitbarts side of the discussion - and I am absolutely not - I could easily distance myself from that without losing credibility, just like every SJW-type person can rightly distance themselves from the BLM supporter who shot at police officers in Dallas, while still supporting BLM. Let me clarify once more though (because I have a feeling you'll misinterpret even the most tepid defense as an endorsement) that I am more aligned with [insert most left-wing outlet on earth] than I am with Breitbart. It's exactly for that reason that I dislike bad criticism of it, because it makes people like me look stupid. 

No idea what you were going for with that line, but it misfired horribly

>...Milo works for Breitbart. Breitbart is the alt-right.

Already given you an example of someone who worked for Breitbart who doesn't even identify as a right winger so... lol. 

>Go to the alt-right subreddit. They say it's a race movement in the sidebar.

You're making a lot of logical leaps here. I'll spell some out that don't follow:

1. Breitbart ""is"" the alt right, even though they've only been labeled that by outside news sources like CNN. If you look on Wikipedia it says alt-right people typically use websites like ""Breitbart and Twitter"". Although that's undoubtedly true, does that make Twitter an alt-right platform too? What if they personally don't agree with that categorization? How are you going to still tell me they must agree with the sidebar of some subreddit that labels themselves the same thing?

2. Everyone who does identify as being an alt-righter must agree with the definition presented by a subsection of volunteer moderators on reddit.com who consider themselves part of the alt-right. Meanwhile, some people have been told they're part of the ""alt-right"" just because they like Trump more than Hillary and have no idea what reddit even is. 

3. Everyone who is part of a ""race movement"" or even has false racial biases is the kind of evil racist who should be ""afraid"" (that's how this conversation initially started). I agree, people who affiliate themselves with the white power movement, stormfronters, people who unironically say ""14/88"", people who go fight antifa protestors, and everyone in that fringe should be fucking afraid whenever they leave their house. But if you think someone should be ""afraid"" because they're uncomfortable in the presence of black people (DISCLAIMER: yes, this is obviously a harmful and racist thought) even though there's not a malicious bone in their body, then you're a bad person. 

Note also that this isn't a concession that right wingers who like Milo are all ""racists"". If you talk to any social justice activist worth their salt they will tell you that every single person including themselves has implicit racial biases. These can't really be ""avoided"" when you live in a society that is allegedly racist. Thus the moral high horse of the people like you who try to label others ""racist"" is in jeopardy. It's not enough to demonstrate that someone prefers spending time with someone of their own race 0.001% more than they do spending time with someone of another race. This is everyone, ostensibly, including SJWs themselves, and including you. In order to demonize someone for being a ""racist"" to the extent where they should be ""afraid"", they have to hold malicious, hateful beliefs in one form or another, and you haven't even come CLOSE to demonstrating that you can so comfortably assume that everyone at a Milo talk is this type of racist, that you might as well be able to assault them on the spot. 

I suspect that at this point in my comment you've realised that there's no possible way you can continue defending the position you initially took and you'll either attempt some ""TLDR"" cop-out, or you'll respond semi-ironically like you did with your last line of your previous comment, which reads..

>Just look for the ones that like to shoot up small businesses

Miles Morales has been the exception to this, but only so far. If Peter comes back, who do you think the fans will be clamoring to read about? Miles Morales' popularity is dwarfed by Peter's. There's literally no comparison. Give it enough time, and you end up with the same old nearly white-only cast.

If you really think a smartphone is not worth $700 while most people in the world are actually paying that, my opinion is that there are lots and lots of factors that you're not accounting for and that you just don't understand - because for many people those phones are providing just enough value to pay $700 every couple of years.

"> You're point was never that it was a gradual transition. I

What the fuck are you talking about? I say that repeatedly. Even going back to the beginning of this. I've been saying that Eminem always leaned more towards the pop side of things and has been going in that direction for many years so when people complain about ""Not Afraid"" they are exhibiting jack-shit knowledge of his catalogue. 



>Show me a poppy, radio-friendly song on SSLP or MMLP.

My Name Is and Real Slim Shady for starters. In another comment I clearly state that MMLP is where it began, likely due to the influence of a major label. I'm going to repeat this again for you in the hopes that you finally understand:

The Eminem Show was a turning point for his sound where it became much poppier. He began this shift during MMLP and even SSLP, as he showed that he was willing to craft radio singles. The albums where he has more control sound poppier, and since he has more control these days, we see the familiar pop sound returning.

If you still wanna disagree with this, go ahead, I'm just getting tired of you claiming I am saying shit I'm not. If you truly think these new tracks are a total fucking surprise to the audience, go ahead. When you say ""Recovery has more radio friendly songs,"" you're right, and I never said anything different. When you say ""MMLP has these 2 tracks that sound poppy,"" you are right and I never said anything different. I am saying - very clearly, very simply - that this is a trend in his sound that started way back. It is not new. It is not alien. He has always been dabbling in this shit. Just because SSLP doesn't sound exactly like Recovery doesn't mean a fucking thing. That has nothing to do with the point I am trying to make.

"What exactly is ""shit weak""?

A guy, whos done a degree in sports science and written two books, both of which are well referenced, writes a blog not a peer reviewed scientific article, about the psychological aspects and makes some allusions as to why they think that way and that there is some evidence to support this.

You've never heard of him or come across his books, fair enough. But you pick at a blog post saying...

> a lot of claims without any sources.
> I require my articles back up their facts with data

...and...

> If you make a claim you have to back it up with a source, if you argue that then I also think your credibility is in question.

..yet it isn't an article, its a blog post! You surely know the difference, its not hard to distinguish. One has gone through a rigorous process of review by qualified people and has to demonstrate that the claims made are based on sound methodology and can be substantiated, the other doesn't. You cant take or leave either, and its very clear that you are going to leave this particular blog post because it doesn't meet the standards required for peer review, but you are incorrect to try and apply the standards of one to the other.

If someone who has a proven track record of a scientific approach to their sports training which has resulted in very real, tangible results and who has taken the time to write two well researched books about it says there is some evidence and that they will write more on it, then I'm happy to read what they have to say with a small degree of scepticism and wait for the more detailed in-depth article they have said they will post at a future date. I wouldn't completely dismiss it just because they haven't cited their source straight away, because they have demonstrated to me in the past (I've read his books) that they take an objective approach to the study of their subject.

In the mean time if I was really interested in the claims made which haven't been cited, as you seem to portray yourself as being as you want to see the data to back up what is being written, I would hit up Google Scholar to see what the peer reviewed literature on the subject has to say (let me know what you find, I'd be interested whilst waiting for Daves more in-depth post).

So what exactly is it about what I've written that makes it ""shit weak""? The term could easily be applied to your twisted logic of applying standards for peer review publication to blogs, but I've taken a little more time to explain why I think your logic is twisted rather than being dismissive as you've been towards me."

>I keep saying ""power"" because he's said he'll steal more bases ever since he hit the majors and it's not happened yet.

Except that he put up 11 more steals at the major league level in 2010 than he did in 2009. 

>or CC's BA

If only OBP were important to a base-stealer, since McCutchen's has trumped Crawford's for the last 2 seasons.

If you look at McCutchen's stats from his move from AAA to the MLB, you see that his numbers are almost perfectly in line. Same OBP, HR rate that is slowly trending upward, SB rate that is slowly trending upward, BB rate that is staying consistent, K rate that is slowly trending downward. These are all things that are indicative of someone making improvements and moving in the right direction. That tells me that the stats he's putting up aren't his maximum stats. Instead, as these improvements continue, we'll continue to see growth in his game. Adding a manager renowned for running wild just indicates that the growth can be expected to be seen in his running game.

I was down on McCutchen last season because I shy away from sophomores anyway. He proved me wrong because I didn't look at his numbers close enough and see that they were right in line with his AAA numbers before he got called up. After putting up another full season of even better stats, I'm a believer.

As for Posey, he played more than 300 ABs at AAA split over 2 years. In that time, he logged 11 HRs on a .330 BA (his highest since rookie ball) with a BABIP in the .365 range (also his highest). This included his highest slugging percentage since rookie ball as well. All his ratio stats indicate he moved into the friendly confines of the PCL. They all jumped substantially, just like one would expect. His HRs, however, did not rise with them.

Then he moved to the majors and the expected drop in his BA, BABIP, and Slugging percents occurred, but somehow, his HR rate increased even while his BB-rate and K-rate both dropped considerably. As for his HR/FB rate, since the 15% number is supported by Rotoprofessor, I'm gonna have to side with Fangraphs on this one. (Note: I just did a google search for his rate, I can't argue that I'm a reader of Rotoprofessor, so I'm just assuming that they are a reputable source.)

As that other site also points out, Posey's HR/FB rate went up, his K-rate went down, his BB-rate went down, and his home ballpark degraded in terms of helping a hitter out all during his transition. As it turns out, that guy's argument matches mine almost exactly.

I'm not saying to avoid Posey. I just don't think he's a better keeper when his stats point at something being amiss and not adding up while McCutchen's point at gradual improvement and sustainability."

">Well, I don't believe in ""a better place,"" so no, I won't see them again. There is a huge difference between someone leaving an event before you and someone dying.

If you believe that death implies oblivion of the mind, yes. Not in the context of believing in an afterlife, though.

>And even the most religiously devout people I know grieve when someone they care for dies. To question the ""need"" for someone to be sad over a death is insensitive as hell.

Yeah but that's just a demonstration of what they really believe. If you grieve when someone dies, you demonstrably don't believe in a wonderful afterlife, all avowals to the contrary notwithstanding.

I can say this confidently because I do believe/know that there's a wonderful afterlife, and when my beloved grandfather died, I was excited about that news! At the funeral I was happy and laughed heartily and consoled everyone else. And I can say already now that I won't have a problem with anyone else I know dying because I know where they're going and I'm happy for them.

Nevertheless, I agree that death is a sensitive issue for a lot of people because we're trained systematically in this culture to ignore its reality. But it is only a sensitive issue because of the taboos and delusions surrounding it, and not because it universally has to be a crying matter. See for instance this interview for an elaboration on that point."

">Women freely chose not to be programmers:
Source: 18% of undergraduate computer science degrees go to women:  http 

And you believe that they ""freely choose"" other majors absent of any larger societal context that pressures men to do certain things, and pressures women to do certain things, because of ingrained, subconscious sexist stereotypes, either because you believe these societal forces don't exist (why would you? you're not a woman so you wouldn't have experienced them) or because you believe they're not important and don't have any influence on people. 

No one is saying women are being forced to choose not to be programmers. The question is why? 

Why do women opt out of these careers? You can either believe there's something innate in women that makes them unsuited to computer science, or that there's some outside influence acting on women, but not men, to influence them to choose other careers. 

If it's about an innate gender difference in ability, we'd see that in standardized test results, and while there is still a gender gap in math test results, it is closing. But even more telling, even girls who are proficient in math still don't choose computer science at the rate boys do. 

So there's something else going on. Some studies strongly suggest it's a perception among girls that they would not be welcome in that industry. The evidence in the latest lawsuit against Google for gender discrimination supports that perception being based in reality.

This game is also about strategy, which I understand you're failing to see. When the souls respawn, there's one soul that will try to suicide bomb. You need to focus that one first.

This way you minimize your SP losses.

The fact that they spawned as minions should be a note to you that they can spawn again and that means you need to be ready to fight them at all times during the fight.

When you fight the final boss, you're tested on a lot of things. Did you observe the boss correctly? Do you know how to manage your BP resources? What about turn order manipulation? Did you properly buff/debuff? Did you actually try to take advantage of the legendary skills? If you fail in any of these, you will end up dead quickly. Very few games test you on the mechanics they introduced in the game this thoroughly.

no it does not. nobody and nothing has the right to the body of another. 

and it is not a ""baby"" until it reaches the point of viability (The point at which it could be born and survive without the aid of modern medical technology) - prior to that it is a zygote then a fetus. not a baby.

> I don't think you are actually grasping my point. It's not about oppressing women, it's about the fact that basically no one seems willing to extend the same rights to both sides of the situation, despite both bring human and deserving of those rights.

No, I grasp your point fine. You think fetuses are super special and think that they are entitled to leech off the body for another for 9 months at great risk to that person.

Yes you do, I have a better idea - how about you stop obsessing what other people do with their bodies, and stop trying to deny them the right to control what happens to their bodies and instead focus on promoting comprehensive sex education - as that is the only thing that has been ever shown to reduce abortion rates. Making abortion illegal doesn't reduce it, it just sends it underground where people die.

Children. You keep using that word. It does not mean what you think it means. But again, you know this. You are intentionally misusing the word as a pathetic attempt to manipulate the tone of the argument and reframe it to your advantage.

"Why would you run down the same road 30 times when you have a nearly unlimited amount of ways to get where you're going? The game isn't about getting from point A to point B. In Morrowind, caves and dungeons don't just conveniently pop up on your GPS, you have to explore to find them. Many times I would go down close to the same path I'd taken before and find a cave I had never seen until then. Not to mention getting lost and sidetracked on the way to find your objective made for a more realistic, immersive experience. Granted, there is nothing wrong with A to B RPG games like the latest Final Fantasy or Witcher, or whatever, but not every game has to follow that same boring formula. Morrowind is about exploring, and less about questing. There are many caves and dungeons which you would never visit since there are no quests which lead you there."

Are you implying housing is a right that should be afforded by a government? Are you saying that the have's have a responsibility beyond basic civic duty to the have not's? And that this transfer should occur under the authority of a governing body? This is not equal.

It's funny you mention class warfare as that is exactly what you're suggesting is the solution. The problem with people like you is, you have a hard time just saying, ""to each according to his need, from each according to his ability."" If you believe this then we have a fundamental difference in belief in our idea of the role of government. Likely you would end up in a very liberal area, and me a conservative area. You think you are the only person that ever had moments of reflection that brought you to the choices you make today. You fool yourself to believing that it's impossible that someone else could give that very same topic, and based on our own experiences, come to two entirely different conclusions. It's possible. Just say it, from each according to his need and from each according to his ability. 

> I'd also like to add, in terms of the property tax issue, that I have no problem paying property taxes - even high ones. They go to public works like schools, sewers, storm drainage, and civic improvements. Some of these projects have very very long payoff timetables and high costs. 

See, that's funny you say that. That's exactly why I willingly pay high taxes in Johnson County. Are you going to make a case against the Shawnee Mission school system? Inadequate sewer systems or storm draining? And tell me more about this issue with lack of ""civic improvement"" that I'm just now learning of. Are you suggesting the streets or something is in disrepair?

> So while yes, property tax is based on assessed valuation of your property, I never never never ""root"" for my property values to go down just because I will pay slightly less this/next year in the bill. I think it's insane when people do that

I've never met anyone who does this. If these people do this, they are likely not investors at all as the tax decrease is proportional to the value of the home. So that leaves me to believe that the people to whom you are claiming to ""root"" for their property taxes to go down are very likely low income families. So you've basically used such an absurd argument that you're using the behavior of poor people to justify your position against rich people being money-hungry crybabies.

">The fact that men don't often show platonic affection anymore is my point.

I'm not disagreeing that platonic affection between males can be sexualized, I'm saying this is a meme that makes a joke out of something that, in our modern context, is sexual. I do agree that men don't show as much platonic affection as they used to, and that male friendships have changed throughout history. I don't agree that this meme is part of why that is. 

>Do you have video to go with that picture?
>How do you know from a still photo that they're making out instead of a single kiss? You don't. You're projecting, like the OP.

I genuinely was not aware that making out was different from kissing. ""Making out"" was not intended to connote any length or duration of the kiss, just a slangy way to refer to it (which apparently actually means something else? TIL). 

>Maybe because people sexualize everything, exaggerate what's happening, and question sexual orientation based on almost nothing.

I'm sorry, but again, in the modern world if two men kissed people would be within rights to assume it is gay. That is the entire point of the joke in the meme. I don't think it should be the case that men should be questioned if they're gay just for having certain ""feminine"" characteristics, not having a girlfriend, or having a close male friend.

>It's kind of sad that you assume every kiss is overtly sexual. That's part of the problem.

This is why I said ""making out"" above. I am referring specifically to kisses that look like the one in the pic, not the peck you give your grandma at Christmas dinner, or the kiss you greet friends with on the cheek, not kisses like in the above. 

I think you are raising valid concerns about oversexualization in our society in general, but a meme about two men kissing (especially on a gay sub) is really not the best place to start the ""this is why men are afraid to show affection to their male friends"" debate, in my opinion."

"You wouldn't be the first to interpret Nietzsche this way. I guess it helps to distract from the serious challenge posed by his thought. Does it really matter why he held certain views if he gives us good arguments for them? In some sense, maybe it does; I suspect Nietzsche himself would think so. He certainly had resentment that he fought to overcome, and he did so fairly successfully. He also had reason to resent certain people. I don't think any of that makes him comparable to the modern neck-bearded douchebag.

What people conveniently overlook about many (not all) of his comments on women is that they are made in jest, not out of resentment. The little rhymes in BGE, for instance, seem like a light-spirited riff on women, not the product of a consuming resentment as so many people would like to say. His longer texts on women in that book reflect his considered political views, and should be engaged with as such. To write them off as a personal idiosyncrasy is just a way of avoiding the real challenge, which is to show why he's wrong (not why we disagree and are morally outraged).

An interesting question, while we're on the subject, is why Nietzsche's comments on women are received so much differently from Schopenhauer's. People just admit that S considered women inferior to men, that his texts reflect his actual views, and that's the end of it. With N they run around in circles trying to show that he didn't really mean what he states quite clearly in multiple texts. Clark's essay on N's misogyny is a laughable example of this tendency; she has a hard time being a bad enough reader to make her case, but she sure tries. Why this tendency to domesticate Nietzsche?"

Ah. So what about the 40 million Americans on food stamps? You've already (grudgingly) admitted they need work too right?

>That's great! Except that won't ever happen without some major changes to education funding distribution, because strained supplies are how the middlemen make their money.

This makes zero sense... You're telling me the same thing doesn't happen with the money we spend educating anchor babies?

>So you are a conservative low-skilled worker competing with illegals? It sounds like you're just lazy and not trying hard enough, otherwise you'd be a billionaire already. Chop chop, get pulling on them bootstraps, baby!

I know that non emotional facts make you very angry, but do you understand how supply and demand works? When there is a surplus of labor, does job competition get higher or lower? Do wages go up or down? No more illegals would mean LOWER job competition and HIGHER wages for low skilled workers who are forced to compete with them. This is like economics 101. Not sure why you're blubbering about boot straps... 

>There will be a surplus no matter what we do. Ever hear of automation? That is a far bigger threat to your position than illegals. It would be great if we could start making a compassionate plan for the inevitability instead of trying to blame brown people for it.

Oh okay. There are other problems that affect low skilled workers so we should just forget about this one. There's going to be a surplus anyway, so we shouldn't even try to help the people who are suffering because of it. I guess it's easy to be ""compassionate"" when you're not the one paying the price for it. Why do you have ZERO compassion for American low skilled workers? I mean, you do realize that a huge number of them are brown right? Why are foreign brown people who are unvetted, and willing to violate the law to come here so special?

Tell me, when automation really starts to kick in do you think it's going to be harder or easier for low skilled workers to get a job when we add millions more low skilled workers to the mix? I know numbers and logic are scary, but I think you can manage this. 

>When the market changes, one must change with it. Industries don't stay forever. They don't have to be computer programmers, but getting them some job training they have interest in would go a long way, don't you think?

Right. One of those changes will be to keep the precious few remaining jobs for citizens as opposed to any random person who wants to sneak over the border. Please tell me more about all the successful job training that leftists have done to alleviate poverty for low skilled workers. Oh, right. You just bloviate about it onstage after trotting out an illegal but never actually do it. 

>Yeah, why solve the root of the problem when you can just be an asshole instead?

C'mon now scro. You can kinda sorta string a sentence together so you can't be THAT dumb. The labor surplus created by illegals sneaking over the border for free stuff IS the root of the problem. Or maybe you're willing to take a 25% pay cut so an illegal can work the same job? Didn't think so. You're perfectly happy to offer up someone else's pay cut though. That's because you're ""compassionate"". 

>Oh boy, youtube.

>but because a disproportionate percentage of immigrants have few skills, it is low-skilled American workers, including many blacks and Hispanics, who have suffered most from this wage dip. The monetary loss is sizable. The typical high school dropout earns about $25,000 annually. According to census data, immigrants admitted in the past two decades lacking a high school diploma have increased the size of the low-skilled workforce by roughly 25 percent. As a result, the earnings of this particularly vulnerable group dropped by between $800 and $1,500 each year. 

...whoops. Guess you can't pretend being against a policy that hurts the poor is ""racist"" anymore. 
 
>Instead, it has changed how the pie is split, with the losers—the workers who compete with immigrants, many of those being low-skilled Americans—sending a roughly $500 billion check annually to the winners. Those winners are primarily their employers.

I am not postulating that anyone owes anyone friendship. I am, however, arguing that dissolving the friendship because someone won't open their legs for you is not a mature, appropriate, or fair way to treat someone who has not otherwise wronged you.

Here’s an excerpt:

The largest study of its kind has unexpectedly concluded that smoking marijuana, even regularly and heavily, does not lead to lung cancer.

The new findings “were against our expectations,” said Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles, a pulmonologist who has studied marijuana for 30 years.

“We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use,” he said. “What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect.”



Remember there is no money in the curing of terrible diseases, there is only money in treatment.

If you had cancer would you not want to look into every option no matter how ridiculous the idea might seem? In a fight for life or death all options are on the table no matter what your belief, dismissing something that has shown might work is irresponsible. If there are signs that it may work for certain types of cancer then as humans it is our responsibility to explore the option.

She is a successful physician and owns her own practice with other doctors working underneath her. She makes way more money than I do and she controls all of our finances.

>The evidence presented first is the San Antonio Spurs. Going into the 1996 season, the Spurs had suffered myriad failed seasons, in that they'd made the playoffs seven seasons in a row, though only making the conference finals once. They had a multiple-time MVP, but had lost bitterly against their rivals in the big games, and their star player was going into free agency. The solution was obvious: tank.


I like how you keep using this Spurs team as your qualifier for why you think that it would be a mistake to trade Cousins. You're comparing the Kings, who haven't made the playoffs in 10 seasons and counting, to the 90's Spurs, who you admit made the playoffs 7 years in a row prior to Robinson getting hurt... You couldn't pick a worse example for a team to compare to the Kings' current situation.

What really happened was David Robinson got hurt, so Gregg Popovich (who was the GM/VP of Ops of the Spurs at the time) decided to take the opportunity to make some major changes. He fired Head Coach Bob Hill and named himself Head Coach, then spent the rest of the season implementing his own system while siting Robinson out. They won 20 games and were rewarded with Tim Duncan.

You want to somehow equate that to the Kings for what reason exactly? Because we also have an All Star big man? You don't see the difference to a team making the playoffs 7 years in a row with David Robinson vs a team that misses the playoffs for 6+ seasons in a row with DeMarcus Cousins? Why am I not surprised?

And the Warriors thing is just absolutely hilarious.

Monta Ellis was their leading scorer for 3 seasons in a row leading up to him getting traded. He was the Warriors' best player in those seasons. At the time, Steph Curry was an exciting young player who struggled to stay healthy. I think it's funny that you conveniently forget that Curry played in only 26 games the year they traded Monta! In fact, he got injured for the 2nd time that season 10 days before they traded Monta, and the Warriors conveniently shut him down for the rest of the season. 

All of that is on top of the fact that they traded Monta for Bogut, who had missed a whopping 108 games in the 2+ seasons prior to the trade, and he never played a single game for the Warriors in 2012 because he was already injured when they traded for him (he had a fractured ankle and hadn't played since January 25th!).

The Warriors' tank job in 2012 was so blatant that it had experts questioning whether traded picks should be allowed to have protections on them! There's a quote in there from John Hollinger (who is now the GM of the Memphis Grizzlies) that says:

""Here's a memo to the league: Stop including conditional protections on draft choices like this. What the Warriors have done this past month is an abomination and needs to be stopped. The only protection that should be allowed are outside the top 14 or inside the top three.""

But hey, that doesn't fit into your narrative, so I can't blame you for leaving these pesky little facts out of your story.

How you have managed to delude yourself into thinking that the Warriors didn't tank in 2012 is beyond all comprehension. You're either trolling just to be a dick, or you're completely ignorant of the situation at hand, neither of which would surprise me in the slightest.

Let's just both take solace in the fact that you don't write about basketball for a living, and drop this subject before you keep digging this hole any deeper for yourself. I'm done arguing this with you, because you have clearly demonstrated that you do not care about facts, and would prefer to stick with your feelings about the subject and create fiction whenever it suits you to do so."

"Here's the thing: You can't usually point to good decisions during the time period they're made, because most really good decisions are long-term ones, which don't have their benefits front loaded.

That's kind of the point everyone here is making, isn't it? That the right decisions seem poor or bad at the time, but either are good long-term on their own merits, or the move the needle/conversation to where the big issues are eventually addressed.

For example, Trump's canceling DACA seems like a bad idea to progressives short-term, but it will actually force the issue to get addressed. The alternative was really Dreamers being left in limbo - possibly for years - had Trump done nothing and allowed the status quo to continue.

There is a similar argument related to the tax cuts, which is seen by the fact Democrats have already changed their tune on it - initially, they said the whole idea was bad, afterwords, and after seeing polling returns and seeing how businesses and the economy are already reacting, they changed to ""well, they aren't big enough/permanent/give too much to big corporations"". But the truth is that our tax system is/was LOOOONG overdue for changes, and still needs more changes, but this is at least a step.

Another one which is less what Trump has done and more a result of him being elected: Libertarians have talked for years about the dangers of too much executive power (the dreaded ""Imperial Presidency"" that really came into its prime with Bush and grew with Obama), but neither side really cared. Neocons liked that Bush could make boom-boom on the other side of the world, and Democrats thought that the White House was going to be Blue from now on. No one cared about the power of the Presidency...

...until Trump became President and started with his Executive Orders. Now we have liberal courts supporting the idea of States' Rights!

.

But, again, the point is that things that are objectively great are very very difficult to really say in the moment, because in the moment, emotions are too charged and ideology is too powerful. We can all look back at, say, Bush Sr raising taxes and say, NOW, nearly 30 years later, that it was a good idea...

...but who, AT THE TIME, would have said or agreed to that? Not many.

Indeed, all the things I listed above that have happened under Trump you likely oppose right now, because emotion and ideology. But 20 years from now, you might look at those things and go ""Oh yeah, I could see those things not being all bad.""

So no one is going to be able to convince you, right now, that Trump has made or is making good decisions. You either think that already or you don't. It'll be this way for you for a decade or two, just like it will for everyone else.

There's a reason that history tends to judge leaders (like Presidents) very differently than they were judged in their own time. Those who were popular in their time are often judged harshly by history (more harshly than the academics and media of the time who fawned over them judged them), while many (though not all - it's not an iron-clad rule) that were unpopular in their own time are seen by historians as not all that bad, and sometimes doing important things - which generally is why they become unpopular. Indeed, Obama will likely be judged more harshly by history. However, this does not mean that Trump WILL be judged more positively, either - as I say, it's not an iron-clad rule or some weird inverse relationship. :)"

"Oops, you're confused. See, only about 40% of voters picked Trump when there was an actual field, with Rubio, Bush etc. Trump racked up plurality wins quickly against the fractured field. However, the wrong people dropped out, and did it too late. If the race narrowed to Rubio-Trump after the first four states, Trump would have continued getting 40%... but would have been losing. Instead, the field was whittled down to Trump and Cruz. Cruz makes no sense in the northeast, so of course Trump got over 50%! How Trump failed to get 70% and 80% wins against Cruz is beyond me.

Most of the GOP does not support Trump, but he won anyway.

Different strokes for different folks) and yelling out ""Hey gorgeous, want some dick?"". Cat-calling is NOT being complimented, it's being harassed. 

I, as a man, have been catcalled. If you're hot and go to a gay part of town, you'll probably get it too, and it isn't pleasant. There's probably one actually cute or attractive person for every twenty or so, in my experience, and those twenty are all (in my case, and that of most woman) going to be bigger than me, stronger than me, significantly older than me, and often surrounded by a group of similar people. 

Cat-calling is NOT nice, don't do it and don't aspire to receive it."
"I'm mad at you because you give half-assed explanations about what things are bugs and what things aren't and you're wrong about half the time. My one and only goal in the Hearthstone community is to improve general literacy levels about how HS actually works. So I'm sorry I have to be mad at you as part of getting this done.

Ok, so let's discuss the concept of 'simultaneous'. If even 'nothing else can trigger or happen until the rest of the effects can complete' does not count as 'simultaneous' to you, what does count as it, and what does the concept even mean? Why bring it up if no interaction would satisfy you as being 'simultaneous'? There's no point in making up terms that have no meaning in HS and will never actually be used.

By any reasonable definition you could give 'simultaneous', as in, 'all of it happens simultaneously before anything else can trigger or react', Cruel Taskmaster's Battlecry's two effects ARE simultaneous, and Blizzard's two effects (deal damage... THEN freeze) are not. 

Now let's talk about card text. By this usage of simultaneous, is it not reasonable to think that a card that says 'x AND y' is simultaneous, as in, no triggers can occur between x and y, but a card that says 'x THEN y' is non-simultaneous, as in, all consequences of x occurring are fully resolved (except for death processing... well, except for poison seeds/reincarnate/death's bite/mimiron's head, but that's a story for another day) before y happens? Is it not, therefore, reasonable to except that since simultaneous and non-simultaneous effects both exist in HS, that Blizzard, which is an 'x AND y', would be a simultaneous package, and to be mad when it actually works as an 'x THEN y' and demand either the card be fixed to match its wording, or its wording be fixed to match its text, in just the same way as when you find out that Sword of Justice does not trigger before battlecries like a 'whenever' but after like an 'after', like Knife Juggler, you would be angry and demand either the card text or the timing of the card is changed to be consistent and not a weird, misworded exception?"
"First of all I was referring to your remark. It seems that you are on board with what we call cultural relativists hence the faillure of communication between us. 
I'm following Fromm's theory of cultural anthropocentricism.
A cultural relativist would begin his thought with the axiom that there is no such thing as universal truth, therefore all ""truth"" is merely subjective opinions of different people. This extents to behaviour that is of course based on thought. Therefore what should and should not happen is relevant with any given society. Societies themselves as the basis of the entire system of knowledge or justice can not be questioned, and therefore not one of them is superior or inferior to the rest. ""truth"" doesn't exist outside the confines of a certain society with a specific cultural system of thought.

I vehemently disagree. First of all this is contrarian with any and all theories that would attempt to alter the establishment, which can not from this context be viewed as fallible. The attempt to alter your society is then always arbitrary since your system of values -that make you want this reform- is inherently contradictory with your society's system of values, and your society is the only acceptable frame of orientation for any evaluatory process. From the cultural relativist point of view, you are always the insane one if you don't accept the establishment, and it is not very peculiar that this theory was used primarilly by capitalist sociologists and psychologists to justify their system. Aside from that it also underlines a logical inconsistency of a person that accepts knowledge and truth as a subjective cultural notion and then attempts to change his society. That person can only be insane since the society he attempts to fight can only be sane, and is in fact the essence of truth for its members.

Cultural anthopocentricism is based exactly on human nature, i.e. the specific inherent qualities, urges and instruments that dictate human behaviour. What is sane is sane because it is compatible with human nature. What is insane is insane because it is incompatible (capitalism may claim to be based on human nature but that is debatable, and marx considers aspects of human behaviour like competitiveness acquired and naturalised). From this point of view societies are not equal. They may be more or less compatible with human nature, and if they are less then they must be overthrown and be replaced by one that is more so. 

From this point of view what is considered moral or ethical or just in a specific society is not necessarilly what is. While in that case morality would change from society to society and from era to era, anthropocentricism views morality, ethicality and justice as something tied to the unchangeable human nature and therefore static itself, therefore what changes is only the perception of each society for these concepts. 
Then it is the obligation of each individual to find the truth about them, and then of the collective to create a society that reflects them.

>It is ironic that you'd forward entirely subjective notions as universal truths considering that these values are fundamental to our current establishment

I don't consider them subjective for the aforementioned reason. And to not become more tiresome, my views on morality and justice happen to follow the enlightenment's train of thought (of which marxism is also a child), with morality tied to rationality and justice to the practical conciliation of conflicting rights. Again, because Kantian roots.
I also don't consider them particularly compatible with the current establishment. In fact they are concepts born in the pre-capitalist era that are severely violated in the current system.

>There is no such thing as self-determination

Every act anyone does is self-determination. We are self-determining right now.

>beyond your own culture

Implying my culture protects human rights and freedoms. It doesn't. It only claims to do so. Or that I concluded to this because of our modern culture. How about no. The spirit of modernism is not relevant with today's ""culture"" much.

Their different values may be more or less rational, and they will be judged based on that. Different evaluations are not equal.

>any attempt to have those outsiders subject to your system is inherently an act of oppression.

Any attempt to force someone to subject to my personal values and system of thought is an act of oppression. Talking to him and attempting to persuade him in our mutual attempt to find truth is not.

>You're presuming that the totality of people gather and choose to endorse a particular system

No. I'm not presuming anyone gathers to endorse anything. I'm forwarding social contract theory that for a legal order to be justified the majority must support it, and it must meet the goals the parts of that society set.

>Not only is that an antiquated notion but so is it actually in contradiction to Marxism.

Ipse Dixit. I disagree.

> A portion of society won't adopt Socialism - that is why a revolution is necessary

A revolution being necessary has nothing to do with what portion of the society supports it. A revolution is necessary because no legal order gives its citizens a right to overthrow it therefore an action outside this order is necessary to alter it. Other than that a revolution being a revolution is relevant with how many support it. A movement of 24 conspirators from the top is not a revolution even if it alters the legal order, and regardless of what it substitutes it with. It's a coup d'etat. A revolution in social sciences needs to have the support of the definite majority of the bottom in order to be a revolution.
Whether it will be bloody or not depends on whether a powerfull minority is there to impede the social choice.

>I'm getting the impression that you're not as grounded in this stuff as you think you are.

I was trying to understand if you were or weren't a relativist.

>Demanding the predominance of dialectics is itself an act of encouraging conformity to a thesis.

You can't demand the predominance of an instrument of understanding the evolution of thought and in marxist dialectics societies and history in general. it either reflects reality or doesn't. Like with science you can't force people to believe something, but that doesn't alter its accuracy or innacuracy. You can attempt to persuade them, and reality proves whether the system is useless or not.
In our case I just mentioned it as a criticism from the marxist perspective to what you were saying. By the way dialectics themselves being or not being accurate in reflecting the evolution of history is indeed debatable. Which is how marxian dialectics came to be. If hegelian dialectics were dogma and conformity to them was forced, there would be no such evolution. hegelian dialectics being accurate was the thesis, them being innacurate was the antithesis, Marx's amendment was the synthesis.

>You're outlying a particular system of social relations and power dynamics which itself is nothing but a collection of ideas. If defending the collective requires the maintenance of these ideas, then it is in effect forcing conformity to ideas.

No. if the collective protects the system of relations it protects the system itself and not the ideas that consist it. Its basis can still be debated, and if the majority decides that this legal order is not reflecting what it should, they might again overthrow that order. 
Even societies that attempted to force conformity to ideas never managed to avoid criticism forever. After all you can't coerce someone into considering something rational even if you wanted to.
Additionally the people that live in a given society choose to live by its rules to the extent that they can leave for something that they believe is a better alternative. So it is self-restriction and not suppression.

>What separates me from the Anarchist is that I don't accept any pretense or rationalization. We're both fighting for an ideology, we are both willing to prevent another group of people from doing what they want in order to force them to conform to our ideologies

I wonder what Marx himself said for your ""ideology"" and your belief that you have a right to force other people to think or act in a way they find irrational. Protip: It wasn't favourable.

>but I'm willing to admit that while the Anarchist (and you) comes up with elaborate and contradictory ways to avoid admitting it.

You mean you are happy in arbitrarilly accepting a view and avoiding criticism like the plague, while we attempt to rationally justify our points of view? Ok.

I don't mean to present this as ""Yeah but everyone else is doing it"" rather that this came off as the least insulting, as it was the most plausible.

I don't watch comic book movies, so I probably wouldn't have seen it if that was the case.

The film presents the violent vigilantism as teen angst free from criticism and the preposterous ""interviews"" at the ends are a lazy and insulting form of trying to evoke the audience into discussing the violence we've seen as a possible solution to a problem that really isn't given context at all. Unless you count the drivel that is the non sequitur scene transitions like the cat being killed, which is designed to make the dopes this film appeals to go ""holy shit wasn't that sooo awesome."" It's as asinine as junk like Family Guy which is designed to evoke emotional response through a pointless event rather than good writing. Coincidentally, I've noticed that mongoloids that love Boondock Saints also love Family Guy.

> Do you honestly think those words weren't used by those crowds fifteen years ago, and Troy Duffy inserted them to sound cool?
Come on.

From what I unfortunately remember, the scene proceeds as follows:Willam Dafoe's character is at a murder scene, another cop is over the body of a dead fat gangster. Cop says ""we call this one the fag man."" Dafoe is offended, cop says ""oh i mean fat man.""

This is probably the worst dialogue ever written that I can recall. First I've never heard anyone in any context refer to someone as ""the fag man."" Someone that thought that way would just call them ""a fag."" The dead character is overweight, so we can assume that the illustrious Troy Duffy wrote this backwards, unnatural pun just to establish that Dafoe's character is gay by using a derogatory word. This isn't neccessarially a poor motivation, but done in this context it's offensive in writing and in taste.

> Poor film making is a little elitist. You don't go see a Michael Bay movie for the character development, and you don't go see Paul Thomas Anderson expecting cool chase scenes and explosions. That doesn't make one movie better than the other, they're not apples to apples. I think it could've been executed better, but given the budget and the fact that it was the first screenplay from a rookie director, it did succeed in getting the points across. I don't think it's a ""bad film.""

This sounds like ""man just turn your brain off"" defense, which is a terrible excuse which lets cash in films made for the lowest common denominator continue to go unchecked and shows a complete ignorance to film as an art form. If you want to maintain a minimum intelligence level you can just buy one of those crib carousel things for babies and look at the pretty lights. It's cheaper than contributing to a fat fuck hack's vanity project films (and self promoting ""documentary"" that makes him look an even worse artist).

> And insulting the city it's supposed to represent? By what, good winning over evil? I don't get it.

Should we have been patient with Mariner when all the players hated him and we hired Payne who disagreed with him on just about everything? Or maybe patience would have helped Nelsen force through more transfers that Bezbatchenko disagreed with? Have you ever even heard about any of this?

At least an experienced coach could have maybe done better in these god awful situations. Winter had a full season test run to implement his tactics and bring in players and he started 0-9. Nelsen had a full season and a half to do whatever he wanted and he was averaging like 35% possession when we let him go. Heaps made the playoffs in his 2nd year, and so did Olsen after his first full season.

You don't get to respectfully disagree with history because it would be convenient for your argument. The Crusades were started for the same reason the Jews and Muslims are fighting right now in Palestine: control over the holy land and its resources. I'm not even going to entertain your silly assertion that WW2 wasn't blatantly fought over resources.

big·ot·ry 
 
[big-uh-tree] 
–noun, plural -ries.
1. stubborn and complete intolerance of any creed, belief, or opinion that differs from one's own.
2. the actions, beliefs, prejudices, etc., of a bigot.


Read it. Understand it. Learn from it. 

If you are not willing to tolerate the beliefs of others, why should they tolerate yours?

"Ok, so you have had your loved ones murdered by firearms with surpressors on them? Or by rifles with barrrels less than 16"" long? Or with registered machine guns? Or do you just want to ban those too because they are scary and make you feel all emotionally secure inside? 

Would your love ones have been spared by the seven day waiting periods and universal registries that your compatriots like to push? Would they have been saved by a magazine capacity limit? Would they be alive today if the guns they were shot with didn't have bayonet lugs or collapsible stocks?

Firearms violence is a symptom of a problem that runs very deep in the current american socioeconomic situation. A needless war on drugs coupled with crippling inner city violence and poverty coupled with the stigma of mental illness and ensuing lack of easy access to care all lead to the violence issues that we experience on a day to day basis. Your baseless ""compromises"" hasn't done jack shit to address the issue of violence."
">Lore and world building is extremely rare on western cartoons, i can only think of avatar, to be honest.

So what if it's rare? It didn't stop Avatar from doing it, did it?

Furthermore Avatar is an entirely different animal altogether, one that concerns both western and eastern animation. A topic I'd rather not get into at the moment.

>A show like that needs to know exactly what it wants to be, because every little thing comes to play later on

I don't know what to tell you, this.... is simply untrue. A story can have complicated and fascinating world building without planning out everything from the beginning. Rick and Morty for example is a good example of this. I HIGHLY doubt that Harmon and Roiland had every piece of plot points and world building mapped out from the very beginning. And yet the show still manages to explore many fascinating worlds many of which has their own sets of culture and laws.

Just because a story started out simple, doesn't mean it can't build an interesting world later on.

>Star Vs. doesn't do that, you can easily tell by how they introduced the concept of Star's wand using batteries, yet never brought it up again.

And yet 2 seasons in we are now exploring the magic realm within the wand and even the the magic realm where the source of magic come from.

Star vs is obviously a show that is susceptible to change. It may have started out episodic with little to no direction, but now we have dimensions to explore, kingdoms with its own culture and social difference between races on Mewni. Clearly the writers want to build a world here. If not they wouldn't have spent time meticulously mapping out the world of Mewni and coming up with creatures like centaurs, mermaids, etc. All of which can be found in the Mastering all Dimension book.

>but given that they spent the better part of two seasons on earth, the chances of them truly building up on that are freaking small.

Yeah, and the fact that the majority of the season 3 intro take place on Mewni means nothing eh?

>it is simply not their time to shine or to introduce them to the great scope of things.

Fine, then. If that's the case then please do tell me what the purpose of episodes like Pizza Thing was? Pony Head's character arc has already been resolved in St. Olga's. What possible purpose could an episode about dicking around in skinny jeans have? And if the answer is that the episode serves as a slice of life filler then I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you. Like I said in my post, ""need is a strong word, we need doorstops but a brick would suffice."" We don't need the episode Pizza Thing, because we already have plenty of other slice of life filler that would serve the same purpose if not do a better job.

>It's the same with Jackie. Chances are whatever plot line they are planning on following with her is going to involve Star's relationship with Marco, and they couldn't begin to explore that before Star confessed, and that needed time to happen as well.

Right, because having no development is better than having SOME development. Is that what you're saying? Gotcha.

>Dude, your stance on Pony head is extremely opinionated. That is fine, everyone has preferences. But maybe don't try to support that dislike with more opinions disguised as objective facts.

I find this painfully ironic. As these are the things you keep on saying in your comment:

I have rarely in my post ever refer to my own personal feeling. And when I do I always consider the target audience because I know that even if I personally don't like something, I know some other people will.

Listen, when you criticize a story, you have to take in to consideration target audience and literary techniques and analyze how effective those techniques were in pulling in the audience. And so far, I hate to say it, but you have presented us with little hard analysis.

"You asked for recommendations on how to reply, I told you what I thought. Regardless of others being upset with this woman it doesn't diminish that you've acted in a way the school didn't appreciate. That's why I said apologize to the school. Then also talk to them with the other parents in tow about the actions of this woman. Reacting in a disruptive manner then refusing to acknowledge that to the school will only diminish or weaken your case. 

You're right, your kid is under no obligation to do what anyone else wants. That doesn't mean the woman was wrong that no one knows what your kid is saying when she tries to talk with a pacifier in her mouth. It wasn't the woman's place to intervene or act on that but it doesn't mean she was wrong. You said as much in your OP.

Lecture? Get off your horse, you came here asking for input. The stranger bit was an example. How about, ""honey, we don't get so close to people we don't know"" or how about, ""honey, stay a little closer to daddy"" or even ""Honey, that woman is suspect and acted inappropriately around other children here and I don't want you near her."" See what I'm getting at? It's not for your kid. While the speaking is directed toward your child, it acts as a warning for the person your child is nearing that you are an attentive, present parent and are paying attention to their actions as well. Is it a little passive-aggressive? Maybe. But it's better than silently hoping nothing happens. 

It will be difficult to teach your child appropriate vs. inappropriate if you are having such a hard time examining your own actions. Again, the woman was in the wrong but that doesn't mean you were wholly right. There was a better way to handle this.

"For many Latinos, he is on par with MLK. Ever wonder where the slogan ""Si se puede"" came from? Given that Oregon's Latino population has been steadily growing (1 in 5 students in Oregon schools is Latino), as well as the work he did directly in support of farmworkers organizing in Oregon, it's clear that Chávez's work was relevant to our city and state. Did you know there was a college in Mt. Angel, Oregon named after him decades ago?

Naming a street after Chávez is not without precedent-- dozens of streets, parks, scholarships, and landmarks are named after Chávez throughout the US. He was bestowed honors from the Vatican and President Bill Clinton. The man was, and is, significant enough for a street name. To say otherwise is being purposefully ignorant.

"> The true church of God would have viable arguments in favor of it that do not apply to other religions.

I would argue that the viable argument in favor of the church that no other church has is that you can gain your own testimony of it through the spirit. Everyone, regardless of background, can obtain spiritual confirmations that the church is true that are convincing to you as an individual. Really, this should be the only thing that matters. If you are diligent in doing everything required of you to gain a testimony, and you don't obtain spiritual confirmation, then who cares about all the other points because the spirit clearly doesn't exist.

> The true church of God would have revelations that appear to be ahead of the times rather than 10-30 years behind it.

I agree, but aren't you sort of cherry picking a little? I would argue that the Word of Wisdom and food storage revelations were way ahead of their time.

> In the true church of God, if they did indeed have any direct prophecies that they specifically stated came from the Lord, those prophecies would all be fulfilled or at very least not directly contradicted by ensuing events.

I agree with this one as well, although it's hard to tell if a prophecy is ""directly contradicted by ensuing events"" or not. A lot of prophecies concerning Christ himself in the bible seemed to be contradicted by ensuing events. The Jews at the time thought, based on their interpretation of the scriptures, that Christ would be sort of a king figure that would vanquish the Romans. When events surrounding Jesus contradicted the prophecy, they assumed Christ was a fraud.

How do you know ""generation"" as referenced in D&C 84 was referring to Joseph Smith's generation? It could be referring to the generation that will build the ""New Jerusalem"", which could be 10 generations from now:

> 4 Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation

Is ""this generation"" referring to ""the people alive right now"" or ""the saints building New Jerusalem""?

> The scriptures of the true church of God would, while not necessarily being provable so as not to take away our free agency, at very least they should not be directly disprovable in origin and claims.

I'll agree that current scientific evidence does not support the BoM's claims, but it's impossible to know for a fact what happened a long time ago without actually being there. Also, what would it say about Joseph Smith if the book he translated in the 1800s predicted completely true artifacts that would be found later in the Americas like steel swords, elephant fossils, etc? That's like basically proving God exists all over again. Isn't it possible that God could have intentionally wiped the slate clean of most artifacts and proofs of the BoM in America?

> I also think there should be some [spiritual] evidence for it that does not apply to every other religion too.

Like I mentioned before, Moroni's promise is just that. If you believe you carried out Moroni's promise to the full extent and received no confirmation, then I can't blame you for leaving the church. But in my experience, a lot of people claim Moroni's promise failed when in reality it just wasn't what they were expecting it to be (I myself used to think that if I did Moroni's promise, it meant I would get some undeniable searing in my soul that would blow my mind and from then on, when I bore my testimony, I would truly know it was true because of that one singular event)."

You just run and gun. That's all there is to it. Run around as fast as you can and shoot as many people as you can before you die. No one plays the objectives which makes every match feel like a variation on team deathmatch.

Like they're planning on refining the maps and adding flyable vehicles that spawn rather than pickups later. But instead they took battlefield, removed the guns, legitimate map variety, and vehicles and then slapped a star wars skin on it.

Fallout is FAR from perfect. If you look at my comment history I've been having issues since day 1 on a monster of a system. But I'll be damned if the game isn't compelling. It's fun.

It has a level up system that has proper pacing rather than how long you grind for. And it is genuinely fucking fun to play.

Onto the point; Crime and poverty is correlated, sure, but if the crime rate in poor white areas is significantly lower than that of poor black areas, then the problem is not a matter of white privilege or that white people are better off just because they're white; there is something fundamentally wrong in the poor black areas.

Since you're all about proportion then a poor white family is to the residents of their area the same as a poor black family to theirs respectively which, in case it's not clear, means that poor is poor regardless of where you are, the fact that the crime rates are demonstrably and significantly different, tells me that it's not a matter of white's having it better.

Incidentally, since you seemed to gloss over this one, what are a poor white person's chances of survive in a poor black area as opposed to a black person in the same area?"

">Here he seems to be casually trying to explain away racism.

His point is that the results of those studies aren't different from a novelty effect. When you're trying to do science you have to remove all possible other explanations for the thing you want to show and only then you can claim whatever about your results. In this case, the novelty effect has not been removed. This is not him explaining away racism, this is him saying that those studies were poorly done. 

>Here I'm farily sure he's talking about racial sensitivity training.

Which again, according to studies, makes people more racist than they were before they took the training.

>Here he goes into a pretty text book slipper slope fallacy

He's making a much deeper point than that and talking about how slow moving things can push you really far away from your initial position. Which is exactly what happened in Germany. His classes talk extensively about Nazis and how normal people like you and me were capable of doing horrible things to other human beings.

>Here he is blatantly putting the majority of the blame on the divide in the country on liberals

""I would say it's more pronounced"", this is not putting the entire blame. From his view it's more pronounced. Not 100% their fault.

I already explained this to you.


You are incapable of listening to what he's saying because you want to disagree with him. Listen to the full interview and open your mind for a second and listen to his argument instead of what you're thinking he's saying because he's an ""enemy"". Treat other human beings and their arguments like the best version of it you can imagine, and don't nitpick aimlessly because you don't agree with their general position on things.

"Your problem here, as I have tried to point out to you before, is that you are constructing a strawman about what feminism is. I have never heard of the site everdayfeminism, but I am relatively confident that they don't speak for all feminists. 

You are selectively picking what feminists you want to acknowledge, and then parade around in triumphant when you find they support your conclusion. There are better approaches than the strawman you constructed.

For instance, feminists and their organizations have overwhelmingly supported certain politicians. Given that it is unlikely feminists would roundly support a politician if they were not upholding the communities views, it's fair to say that we can take the views of politicians feminists roundly support as a proxy for the views of feminists. At the very least, we can say that the views of politicians feminists roundly support are a better better proxy for the views of feminists than a website you found. 

Now, you claim that I haven't given you a single instance of a western feminist denouncing how women are treated in Muslim countries. This is an odd claim considering that I have. Again, Barack Obama, a self-identified feminist who was roundly supported by feminists, not only condemned the treatment of women in Muslim countries, but started the campaign against ISIS - even, in part, defending military action on the grounds that ISIS was brutalizing women. If you would like another contemporary example you can look at Hillary Clinton. Clinton famously said, ""women's rights are human rights"" in China, a line that was intended, and taken, as an attack on the sexists policies of the Chinese government and oppressive countries the world over. There are many more example, but I'll stop here.

The evidence suggests that your assertion is incorrect. It is simply the case that feminist elect people to office who show great concern for women in oppressive countries. So, there goes the first part of your argument. 

\> I can't believe anyone would seriously doubt that the vast majority of feminist activists focus on issues that primarily concern women in the West. You also seem to defend this as morally permissible - so are they not doing it, or are they doing it but it's okay? Pick one. 

Your confusion here is that I have some obligation to defend either position. I'll I need to do is present counter arguments to your idea that if feminists cared about justice, then they should spend more energy focusing on women in more oppressive countries. 

There are several good arguments against this idea. One is that feminists already spend a significant portion of their political energy supporting women in the developing world. This has been demonstrated above. 

Another counter-argument is to say that you can care about justice without spending any of your time supporting women in the developing world. This is fairly easy to defend. There are no social groups in the US that do not have it better than some relevantly similar social group in another part of the world. This has been true since at least the end of WW2, if not before then. Thus, if you want to defend your argument, you must either 1) bite the bullet and say that no political or social movement in the US should be concerned with our affairs, and instead concern themselves with only their worse off peers in the developing world - this includes the civil rights movement, or 2) provide some insight into why feminism is uniquely responsible to take on this task. 

You have failed to do either, and thus have not made a convincing argument.

You could save yourself a considerable amount of time by doing more reading comprehension. I didn't say you were incapable of ever changing your mind. I don't care if you changed your mind on IAT, IQ, or theism. It's irrelevant. Again, some people are unable to use reasoning on some issues. "

"Well, you said you've got middle-aged, near-feral cats. Those are tough to place, and honestly you should have thought of this possibility when you took the cats in. As the fox said to the Little Prince, ""You remain responsible, forever, for what you have tamed."" A cat is a 15-20 year commitment, and if the possibility existed that you'd have a baby in the next 15-20 years and that having a baby would mean the cats lost their homes, you shouldn't have taken in cats.

Of course, that doesn't help you now, but I feel like I need to throw that in there so that by giving advice I'm not excusing the behavior of taking in pets when you can't make a lifetime commitment to them. There's a program available for people who want the company of a pet without the commitment. It's called fostering, and rescues never, ever have enough foster families, especially families without pets of their own (meaning you can take in fosters that haven't been quarantined for illness without endangering resident pets). 

So, my first suggestion for you would be keep the cats. If they don't get a ton of attention, okay, no big deal, if they're near-wild they probably don't want the attention anyway. If they're getting food, water and any necessary medical care, then they're better off with you than without you. Even if you do find homes for them, that's no guarantee the new person will keep them forever--what if they have a baby and aren't as careful about finding homes as you were, so your former cats just end up getting dumped at a shelter? It happens, even with adopters who seemed amazing. Shoot, I've had it happen with adopters I personally screened, even with the good instincts I've developed from years of working with rescues.

If it's just not possible to simply keep the cats, you might consider contacting local rescue groups and asking for a ""courtesy listing"" through the rescue's website and/or Petfinder. Some groups will help private individuals place pets if the private owner is willing to hold onto the pet until a home is found. However, in this case animals owned by the rescue will typically take priority as far as recommendations to adopters who don't ask about a specific pet; the courtesy listing animals will need to generate specific inquiries. However, it's better to have your cats on Petfinder than not, since it's the main search engine used by people looking to adopt.

Another option might be to ask local rescue groups if you can surrender ownership of your cats but become their foster parent until they get homes. If they're up to date on vaccines and spaying/neutering, and you continue to pay for their care until they're adopted, some rescue groups will allow this. Then you have professional help with finding and screening adopters."
"You think so? I'm going through the top messages on this thread alone and in the top five, there's one that only just holds Russia as culpable as the US in the problems in the Middle East. No post I've seen, down to the one you replied to, even begins to look critically at the situation in the Middle East, because it's easier to blame the West than it is to consider that perhaps a lot of the issues in the Middle East are the natural progression of an incredibly theistic society conflicting with a world within and without that's beginning to become less and less theistic on the whole. Even that's an absurd oversimplification, because there's so much fucking history and variables contributing to the colossal clusterfuck that is the Middle East, but learning about stuff is hard, and we know a lot of Western Europe and America (let's just say NATO or America because it's hard to think about stuff when assigning blame) has had their fingers in the Middle East and caused at least some of the strife with the way they've supported certain regimes and aided the overthrow of others in different countries, so let's just say instead that NATO is to blame for everything in the Middle East.

All that, I get. Having to learn about why the Middle East is in such a bad state takes a long time, and it's easier and more popular to say it's America than it is to actually do the research and commit the time to understand the problem, because assigning blame to countries outside the Middle East makes people feel like they're doing something, even if they're really not.

I think we would ultimately agree, though. But the answer is not to tinker with the current system, which is already overcomplicated. Move to a progressive consumption tax.

A lot of evil has been done in its name, but since its beginning it has also been doing good. Just as the United States is responsible for both good and evil, writing it off as a criminal organization would disregard the good that it has done throughout history.

You ask how can I presume that I am right about my current thought, in the same manner, how do we know that psychologists, physicists, literary analysts, etc., are right about there thought today? Theology is just as valid of a institutional field of study as any of those, and through this scholarship, a more accurate interpretation and understanding of its content is achieved. Now are my views the final say on the Christian tradition? No, just as scientific thought today will eventually be seen as being antiquated, so will current Theological thought. However, as Theology progresses, it will definitely build upon the ideas in use today.

In regard to your point concerning slavery and violence, when looking at its historical context, the Hebrew culture promoting slavery and violence was hundreds of years ahead of its time in terms of human rights. If you do a study on slavery within the Hebrew nation versus the study of other nations in the Ancient Near East, you will quickly see that the Hebrews were downright humanitarian. Also, the condoning of slavery was not the final word of the Hebrew scripture, rather as the society progressed, slavery eventually became condemned. In order to see and understand this, a person must be very familiar with the meta-narrative of the Old Testament and the history of its development.

Finally, by saying that you would not act in a certain way if you were God, is providing an anthropomorphic version of God. God is not human any more than you are God, and attributing human motives to God is mistaking the fundamental nature of God as being finite.

You disprove your own point by mentioning how there were means to fight back against the dragons, just because Harren the Black failed at his attempt doesn't negate that fact.

>lol. seriously? Then the decapited guy will still be alive in the end right?

He might be dead, but his death was relatively quick and easy rather than slow and torturous.

>Advocating for a clean death in westeros lmao

Hardly funny, we see that Westeros has no problem outlawing flaying thus it isn't like they are cool with everything.

>The traitor suffers before dying as an additional punishment, don't see a problem with this,

It is an utter sick and disgusting action, that fact that Stannis allows that shit is a great negative to his character with him acting unjust. 

>I'm not defending anything, I'm just saying that his method isn't the worse one out there in Westeros which is true

You are absolutely attempting to justify it by pretending it isn't a big deal and saying ""Well, Ramsay is worse"" like that is a defense.

>killing innocents, killing traitos...yeah such a slight change

Much less of a change than just making up scenes. Simply, Stannis has already burnt people alive who merely refused to go along with burning the symbols of their faith. 

>Anyway you're the one trying to change the goalpost, our discussion wasn't about STannis method in the first place, it was how this method was applied int he books and in the show

No, my point is that Stannis' actions are absolutely wrong and both cases for the fact of the method he employs. I also said I hardly see it worse if the reason he uses his method is because he actually believes in it rather than him doing it all for show.

>in teh books he kills traitors coming close to cross the line one time , in the show he kills innocent people without any regard

Traitors in the sense that they oppose Stannis' objectives, not because they have been found guilty in any trial (including his own brother).

>Cool, I don't share your opnion regarding Dany but I share your regarding Dany, I didn't know Dany and Stannis scenes were so linked for you that by not considering one you automatically doesn't consider the other though

Because it ridiculous to say one is some horrible change when it is a vastly less of change than just fabricating scenes. Stannis performs his crimes repeatedly in the books and shows zero remorse while Dany doesn't do any of hers.



>And I already talked about Dany scenes, all of them have a scene compatible with them in the books. 

Only they don't, they are completely made up scenes with no connection to anything happened in the book. Stannis' actions are vastly more compatible.

>Dany sentencing her follower to death mirrors what she did to MMD, Dany killing a noble in S5 mirrors her torturing of the shopkeeper in DWD and so on.

False, she had much more reasons for why she executed MMD than she did her handmaiden. Torture while messed up morally (Stannis does it also), isn't the same as brutally killing some random person. The Wineseller actually had a connection with some deaths of her Unsullied while that guy had none that the show tells us of. Furthermore, that ordering of sharp questioning came after it being recommended to her by Shavepate before and made in a heated moment. While, the show's actions was cool and calculated move not recommended by anyone and in fact conflicts with her beliefs in episode almost immediately before that one.

>It does, unlike Stannis whose attitude towards burnings completely changed in teh series, Dany's attitude wasn't changed so much compared to the books

Yeah, Stannis' opinion sure has changed in ASOS he burns people to please a religion he doesn't believe in, in the beginning of ADWD he burns people to please a religion he doesn't believe in, and at the end of ADWD he burns people to please he doesn't believe in. What an amazing change of absolutely nothing.

In contrast, to Dany's lack change of where she doesn't do any of that stuff thus she can hardly change her opinion on that matter. Though, we do know that she allows two individuals she believed to betray her have the chance to redeem themselves.

>Yet you clearly said he was more blackened compared to the book version

Yes, because I am being objective and recognizing some stuff was darkened while other stuff was lightened. 

>You can call it that but it's better than burning innocents

Something Stannis wasn't far off from doing in the books, heck Jon feared that he was going to burn an old man and a baby so much that he was forced to take drastic action.

>Anyway, burning people for some religion you believe is what Vic does, Stannis is doing it as a method of execution you can call it cruel as muc as you want (while truthfully every death is cruel) at least it's better than burning innocents

Both are utterly horrible, and they are more similar to each other than just made up scenes with no connection to the books.

>Not just wants, he is ""begging"" for sex which completely makes no sense if you take book Stannis into account 

It doesn't conflict with anything about book:Stannis, we know that after BW he was desperate and we know they have sex. It is hardly a massive change, instead shows some of Stannis' weaknesses.

"I assume your culinary experience is lacking?

A chef's knife is the kind of thing you need to try before you buy. Balance, fit, size of your hand, weight, it all matters and you can't pick a knife based on reviews any more than you can a car.

So that means you need to go to a knife store. When you get to the store, I would recommend trying both western and Japanese style knives. They have very different feels and you won't know what's right for you unless you try both. Western knives are thicker and curved. Better for rocking, chopping things like vegetables and herbs, while Japanese knives are thinner and better with proteins and delicate work. 

Since you're a noobie, specifically, I would try Misen brand hybrid. It's cheap (only $65) and serves as a compromise between the two styles of chef knives, meaning it can do pretty much anything adeptly. If you want to shell out for a high-quality knife, Misono and Wüsthof are arguably the best brands for the cost (about $150 each) for each style.

You're also going to need whetstones (or a water stone, depending on the store) to sharpen your knives. As someone else said, you want a low-grit and a high-grit stone. 8000 might be excessive for a home cook. Two stones, one at 800 and one at 2000 would be fine, you won't be able to tell the difference between the 2000 and the 8000 in terms of sharpness, and you need to work way less hard with a 2000 grit stone than an 8000 grit stone. Don't get a two-sided stone. They suck. 

Look up a tutorial on blade sharpening. Do what they tell you. After each use of your knife, wash and dry it immediately and then rub it with a neutral oil to keep it sharp.

Would you do 3 to 5 more years in prison to stand up for atheism? And top of that I'd bet that most atheists are white. Which makes up a vastly smaller percentage of the prison population. And most likely have higher educations. But again these statistics really don't mean all that much. Most blacks are religions and get lock up at much higher levels then whites, for the same crimes no less. And the simple fact that atheists don't speak out about this as 20% of the population shows a lack of moral urgency. And I was referring to anti theism mainly, not atheism. But again, if atheism was the next step to our social evolution then you would see a stark moral contrast between atheists and theists in America. And while I'm not arguing in favor of religion I am arguing against anti theism on the basis that if we are to perpetuate an idea or belief that worked towards conversion of the population that it would have the capacity to address the moral issue of the population. And the large % of atheistic American that don't fight against racism is general proof that atheism or at least anti theism is by no means an answer."

I have tried to help you to see this by continually asking you to prove there is no god. You simply can't.

The people who lived there throughout most of its history didn't identify as Palestinians, and when the Romans left, they went back to being Levantine Arabs, Jews, Armenians, Druze, Bedouins, or Coptic Christians, Ottomans, etc. 

I respect the historical tie they have to the land, but they are only Palestinians in the sense that they call themselves so. So many of them come Turkish families or Saudis after that. It is a region of immigrants, just like the United States or Brazil. You might not know about all this, and it seems to me that in your mind, the whole region has always been culturally homogeneous. But in actual life, more than one culture considers it to be the very center of the entire universe. So no. they haven't often considered themselves to be Palestinians, and to says that they weren't isn't a Zionist plot, you lunatic, it's a culturally respectful observation.

 It wasn't until the beginning of the modern PLO in the early 60's that within the West Bank and Gaza territories, only non-Jew- non-Druze, non-christian, non-bedouin, non-Armenian, non-Coptic Arabs who worshiped Allah and Mohammed as his prophet decided to resurrect the title of ""Palestinian"" as a tribal marker.

I find it bizarre that you persist in arguing with many of those of us who told you it was a bad idea.

Obviously not the words themselves, which I thought was pretty clear, but the situations that using those words could bring about if it isn't made clear that the individual in question is atypical. Use your imagination here. In any case, at least I acknowledged that it might not be good for the individual to use pronouns they don't accept. Nice of you to conveniently ignore that though.

Oh, it absolutely does. This right here indicates to me that you aren't really familiar with the vast multitude of conditions that can cause homosexuality (In it's varying degrees and forms), transexuality, or transgenderism.

Not scare quotes. I was actually using it out of respect for you, instead of referring to the individual in question by biological sex (Which, again, is the common usage of the pronouns in English) The quotes were only to reference that the individual in question was an atypical ""She"".

Companies, industries, etc. are expected to sell more than they did the year before. That's called growth. You're either ""record breaking"" or you're ""declining"".

Shifts in consumer interests in the US has caused a decline in sales across the board for automobile manufacturers. They're all growing in China with the new middle class, falling in the US. People are buying Crossovers/Sedans in the US, but not enough to account for all the other cars they aren't buying.

OP made a post that was elitist and douchey from the outset -- it's in the title. I didn't brag at all. In fact, I said it was too expensive (which means I don't pay it) -- again, the meaning of words elude you. ""Brag"" -- look it up.

It's both. It is more expensive than most other waxes because, by OP's own admission, it's $50/gram. You've been ""bragging"" about your prices (see, that's how you use that word) and they're lower than that, so I'm right in that regard.

">[1] What, are you going to be paying her?

>[2] Do you not think that there's a distinction between love and sex?

There is, but they are connected in my mind. In the mind of a slut, love and sex are sadly viewed as mutually exclusive. This is a matter of not being on the same page. We're not compatible.

[3] Why do you feel so possessive about women? I enjoy art that millions have people have enjoyed before. I like my friends who have lots of other friends. I don't understand why someone/thing having been enjoyed by others makes it less enjoyable for you. Did you share well as a child? :P

This isn't possessiveness. It's hard to say that it is when I'm telling you I want nothing to do with them. Purity is attractive to me. Women who have respect for themselves are attractive to me. Women who don't separate love from sex, are attractive to me. Sluts, while physically attractive, I view as void of personal integrity, which is a big turn off.

Let me put it to you like this: Art is statically appealing and can be both enjoyed and loved by millions without consequence because it grows in value the more people who indulge in its many wonders. Art that is loved by the many becomes part of culture, and that connection enriches all of their lives. Women are not statically appealing. In fact, after reaching peek beauty in their teens, they are all on a steady decline to having zero sexual value. While they are young, they are sought after by men from around the world, and when they fuck a lot of them, they are enjoyed and loved only temporarily. Unless of course if she becomes famous for her slutiness on a reality television show aimed at the lowest common denominator of viewers, then she can be culturally relevant for fifteen minutes to dipshits. (Porn could potentially have more lasting appeal if she's attractive enough.) However, a slut ceases to be a source of enrichment to your life the moment she moves from you to the next cock. Meaningless sex is instantly gratifying in the moment but ultimately has zero lasting effects. The more sex a woman has, the more worn she becomes. The more experienced, the more jaded, the less sexually curious and the more familiar she appears with the act, the less compelling she is as a person because it's apparent she has slept with many people before. Women are not art, snowflake. They are only capable of being enjoyed sexually by many partners today because of unnatural contraceptives like condoms and the pill. Take that away, and what you're left with is a desire to find the perfect male who will love and take care of you while you're pregnant with his child, because you wanna be fucked that bad. 

Are you conflating women with things? Now that's some serious cognitively dissonant self-hating misogyny right there. I shared everything I was allowed to share actually. It got so bad my dad had to get on to me about how I would loan all of my things out to the neighborhood kids while never attempting to get the stuff back. (I felt bad for coming from a more well to do home while the rest of my friends had families living on food stamps.) 

>Are we speaking about some specific woman I should know about?

No, it's a universal trait of worn out slut. They're all like that because they can't help it. It's who they become.

>And a man's isn't if he has behaved promiscuously in the past?

Irrelevant attempt to change the subject.

">Testosterone is not the main thing that controls our sex drives that would be dopamine, a thing men and women have. Estrogen and Testosterone play a role along with other things.

I may be a simple college dropout, but even I know testosterone and dopamine are intimately connected. Probably the same reason there are more male adrenaline junkies than females. Me thinks you're arguing in bad faith.

>but lets look at them anyway, the masturbation one you may think shows women don't enjoy sex, when really it shows that women, in general, are arroused in a different way. Women are more reactionary than men in their sex drives. This means that they may not want sex with every random hot guy they see, but when they want it they want it a lot. There are some reasons for this that have nothing to do with the sex drive. One study found that men and women would accept (at a similar rate) a hookup with a person they had never met, if it was deemed a ""safe"" decision, as in someone had vetted the guy previously.

Can we actually take a look at that? Because it's my experience that studies often use politically correct language to mask politically incorrect findings. Like that one study that said women's sexuality is more ""fluid"", but when you actually sit down to read it, it just says women find more excuses to not to have sex or not enjoy sex.

>As in women like sex, they just like sex in relationships more (at least in general). That goes back to what I said originally, in that women have sex drives, they just don't find every single guy attractive enough to have sex. Looks aren't always enough for a woman. I know for sure they aren't enough for me, I need to know the guy is safe and has a decent enough personality. This was proven in the study I just shared where if they knew the guy was decent, they would be more willing to have a ONS.
So there is scientific evidence, using your own sources (again) that proves that women like sex and have a sex drive.

That is preposterous. That's like saying children who eat their veggies because their parents promised they could have ice cream, actually want to eat veggies.

It's not like you're trying to blow up cars and they don't explode, you can do whatever you like, it's just that there's penalties for anti-social behaviour.

> And get off your high horse with that sweeping statement about self-control.

When you get older you might understand, however till then you won't and I respect that because presently your incapable of doing so (seriously, its a physical thing, your brain hasn't finished developing till you're about 25 or so). I spend plenty of time in free mode, and the friends I play with also don't go around killing players indiscriminatingly and blow up each others cars for shits and giggles. I also intentionally drive around carjacking NPC's to get bounties so others have a target to hunt in game, usually in the NPC car so there's no chance of other players getting hit with being a bad sport.

This game is as fun as you make it, if you get your rocks off randomly killing people minding their own business and blowing up their cars, then unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, you're a bad sport and you do need to go away and play with others who share your specific needs, leave those of us who do actually enjoy playing the game without constant interruption and griefing to do so.

Bonding and communal effort is not antithetical to anarcho capitalism, and if that’s what you believe then there’s perhaps not much use trying to convince you otherwise. It should be clear that not everyone involved in city cleanup or harvesting is or was an ancap, but I can forgive your ignorance for believing that nationalism is the glue that holds people together as a nation as you seem to believe that the important part is the nationhood and not the community. It’s a little too circular in reasoning and it doesn’t justify what you’re trying to argue.

I never wanted to be a politician. I wanted to build railway services in the city, things people could actually use, things that would actually last and be of benefit. I also wanted time to work on my own personal builds. Between my brother and I we did a lot of good in Aurora, the vast majority of which came by way of putting in a lot of creative sweat and resources. 

My political claim to fame is perhaps working with Farley to install the first pieces of our snitch network, hunting down the Spaniards which harassed the city, and helping to create a vault after the Mandy incident, but beyond that I don’t see how my time was well spent role-playing as a member of a government which could hardly boast as many citizens as it did elected officials.

Civcraft can be a sociopolitical simulator, and there are ways to build Aurora strong, and that first comes down to appreciating the people who would even want to be residents of the city or region since they contribute to the health of the economy. You can enjoy the traditions you’ve chosen to adopt, but if you want to pretend nothing happens without a government and spend more time with political busywork rather than building and trading then I guess that’s what you’ll do.

If you ever grief the city again I will pearl you, Tambien, and I expect you to live by that outcome since you pride yourself in the value of the law and nationhood and community.

I think what he said does do exactly that. Here's the formula:

2. The example is offered of a place where strong gun control laws haven't reduced crime rates.

3. That example is offered in the form of an analogous argument to the contrary, demonstrating how it doesn't work logically.

"It's laughable what is considered ""experienced"" these days, you pass yourself off as experienced while saying garbage like ""the DPS check is tight..."" and ""some mechanics are pure RNG"". The first point is utter non-sense while the second point has some credibility which i will elaborate on below.

For starters the dps check is not tight at all, regular pug groups beat bosses, even gorseval, with minutes to spare on average. Multiple guilds have shown 6 man no updrafts and 10 man no updraft gorseval is common place now. My guild regularly sells raids with 8 people and we never hit enrage timer. Ample evidence against this point out there that it's really a waste of my time to elaborate further.

On your point about RNG behind some mechanics, sure there is RNG behind who has to deal with some mechanics throughout a certain fight (Slothasor fixate, matthias corruption etc) but the mechanic itself is CONSISTENT (e.g whoever gets the slothasor fixate will be temporary tank). This forces EVERYONE in your group to know the mechanic and to PAY ATTENTION, which again falls under PERSONAL SKILL. There is no ""luck"" associated with dropping a poison bomb on the group on slothasor, there's only ""Oh i didn't pay attention and pressed my special action key for no reason and dropped it on the group"". 

Trust me, I have 170 insights and every single achievement in raids. I've pugged at least 50 hours on each boss and low manned all of them multiple times on sell runs. All of your excuses are exactly that, excuses and is entirely a skill problem. So before considering yourself an experienced raider and pitching a sales pitch you might want to you know... perhaps clear all the wings first for one?"

I did. He is probably one of the weakest top laners in a 2v2. Gnar in his normal form is squishy, has low damage when engaged upon and bad escapes (unless a minion wave is moving in), and mega gnar only has slow, telegraphed attacks. In a 2v2, the side with Gnar loses, especially if the opponent is something like Fiora (who wins against gnar in a 1v1 to begin with), GP (good AoE damage) and maybe even Lissandra.

A semi-random pattern, yes. That being close 2, far 2, close 2. Only issue is, thats still pretty unreliable. Because whether its vertical close or horizontal close and vertical and horizontal far matters a lot. Vertical far is fairly easy to proc. Horizontal far extremely difficult. Horizontal close is very easy to proc. Vertical close can be trickier. And the enemy can also abuse that by simply moving out of sight while he has close and force it into far.

Mmh, close ,but no cigar. No, the dash itself is indeed 400 range, but the important part is that that is purely the movement aspect. The damage aspect actually goes beyond 400. More precisely, the attack aspect is actuall an autoattack eminating from Fiora (which has a 150 melee range). Now, I think you can put 2 and 2 together and understand what that means. Precisely. She Qs into AA range, then puts her E slow on him (which is naturally substantionally stronger than Gnars at early levels), while also gaining a movement speed boost from her passive. So yes, if Fiora goes on him, he has to Hop immideatly, trying to kite is pointless as Fiora is on him, has slowed him for more than he slowed her for, has also gained bonus movement speed, has another dash up shortly (especially if her Q is higher than level 1) and does far more damage.

I dont ignore it, we are talking about a jungler abusing Gnar. If its a 2v2, as above, Gnar loses. He is weak in 2v2s as gnar and mega gnar, especially if hop is down. Mega gnar has high base stats, sure, but is slow, his attacks are extremely slow and predictable, and his CC is unreliable. Any jungler and top laner combination makes short work of him, regardless of his jungler.

Yes yes, you are describing Lee, not Gnar. Lets make it clear why Gnar isnt a generalist. See, the trick about a generalist, as I mentioned, is that they can do everything at once. No downtime. If you pick Gnar, you have no way of guaranteeing that you have the teamfight stomper when you need him. You have no way to guarantee that you have the ranged kiter when you need him. He isnt a generalist. He is a niche character who can simply fulfill 2 different niches at different times, but has no guarantee that he can fulfill either at the time that is neccessary. 

The best way to explain this is using a fighting game as a metaphor. A generalist would be someone like Lee. Lets say in a fighting game they are a character who are good in every aspect. Neutral, crossup, block, etc. etc. He doesnt excel at any, but he is good at all of them, meaning there really is no reason to pick anyone else unless they excel in something very important (see: Lee Sin from release to season 4). Then we have Gnar who instead is a character who can do a lot of things, but only half of them at once. In one state, he is good at neutral and crossups, the other one good at blocks and so on.

Lets actually use a more precise version for this. Lets take SSBB. Now, Lee Sin is Falco or Fox. A jack of all trades, who really does everything. On the other hand, Gnar is Samus. One version, Zero suit, is good at plenty of things, but bad at others, the other, Samus, is good at plenty of other things, but bad at the things Zero suit is good at. Now Falco would actually make other picks redundant. Samus didnt, because both versions only did half.

As I expected, pure numerical value, which of course means that china with its unusual meta game skewed the statistic by virtue of being much bigger. 

Well even that is wrong, as I mentioned. For someone who is supposedly oppressive, he did very little oppressing.

And Im saying ,he doesnt. ""Dominating them in lane"" yeah thats what good picks tend to do. Though, to be fair, its not Gnar doing that. Its the actual top picks doing that. Gnar is more of a ""well, the better picks are already gone, guess Ill settle with seconds"" pick. And doing things better is also something the top picks do. Teemo and Renekton arent not being picked because of Gnar. They arent being picked because they suck. 

Maokai and Malphite arent being picked because you got shen and you also got Gragas in the jungle. Again, not because of gnar. 

He isnt. Because he doesnt do everything. He has the potential to do a lot, but the ability to only do part of it. And he doesnt drop other picks. But yknow, Im curious. Do you even have a single shred of evidence to back your claim up? Anything that even remotely ""proves"" that Gnar is the one blocking out picks instead of the reality that its the likes of Shen, Irelia and other top picks? 

I can, because you again looked at the raw numerical data. Now, be a smart guy for once, and dont look at the raw numerical data, but look at the individual regions. Actually, I suppose you cant be trusted to do that, so let me do it for you. NA. 2 picks. LPL. 2 picks. LCK. 12 picks. EU. 23 picks. Meaning that 2 regions completely ignored Gnar, while 2 picked him a lot. And not just that, it was the same people who tended to pick him. So yes, he was a pocket pick. A popular pocket pick, but a pocket pick nonetheless."

You know they actually don't right? They sell oil and works of art and hostages for hard currency. They largely aren't getting paid through the banking system. It does happen I'm sure, when intelligence agencies don't know where the money is going. They just launder their money, something much harder for wikileaks to do because they're a website with a few staffers and ISIS is a terrorist group which controls an aread bordering like 6 countries. There is a world of difference between cutting a few dozen staffers from the monetary system and cutting off a 25 million people. 

>Also thousands of losers from Europe are flocking to ISIS and somehow magically no border authority ever sees them.

But they do see them. All the time. There are tons of people who've had their passports revoked and are sitting at home. A ton make it through, and it helps that Turkey refuses to actually close their border. If you can get to Turkey you can get to ISIS, and there are millions of people traveling to Turkey, thats a lot of noise to hide defectors.

>Frankly, I think lower taxation leads to more innovation and growth for a country. People seem to generalize that there are no social safety nets in America. There are welfare programs, shelters, and soup kitchens in the U.S.

I didn't say that there are no social safety nets in the U.S.A., only that they're poor in quality and not very effective. The welfare programs in the U.S. are not apt to help people out of poverty, which shows in your social mobility numbers, which are the lowest in the first world. If you're born poor in the U.S., you're likely to stay poor. Growth and innovation, I don't really see it.

> And you support the fact that wealth is purposefully allowed to be distributed to rich people who will continue to save massive amounts of money, whilst ignoring those in poverty who literally work so much harder than them, for scraps.

You're acting like ""the rich"" sit in their towers atop a mountain of cash, laughing at the plight of the dirty peons below. That's not how it works. Their money is invested, and it is so globally already. Which, by the way, has done more against poverty than anything else.

They had Raquel Welch doing stuff like that in the '60s. It was all in a context of talking about why Sarah Connor — what Linda created in 1991 — was, if not ahead of its time, at least a breakthrough in its time. I don't think it was really ahead of its time because we're still not [giving women these types of roles].

Director Patty Jenkins responded by saying not every woman character has to look ""hard, troubled and tough to be strong.""

Linda looked great. She just wasn't treated as a sex object. There was nothing sexual about her character. It was about angst, it was about will, it was about determination. She was crazy, she was complicated. … She wasn't there to be liked or ogled, but she was central, and the audience loved her by the end of the film. So as much as I applaud Patty directing the film and Hollywood, uh, ""letting"" a woman direct a major action franchise, I didn't think there was anything groundbreaking in Wonder Woman. I thought it was a good film. Period. I was certainly shocked that [my comment] was a controversial statement. It was pretty obvious in my mind. I just think Hollywood doesn't get it about women in commercial franchises. Drama, they've got that cracked, but the second they start to make a big commercial action film, they think they have to appeal to 18-year-old males or 14-year-old males, whatever it is. Look, it was probably a little bit of a simplistic remark on my part, and I'm not walking it back, but I will add a little detail to it, which is: I like the fact that, sexually, she had the upper hand with the male character, which I thought was fun."

The one point I will respond to, however, is the point on criticism. If you lack empathy for a person's goals, if you do not understand what their goal is and what they're hoping to achieve, you are in essence attempting to stop them. That is by definition, sabotage. I understand Anita's publicly-stated goals. I feel she's not as involved in said goals as she could be. That being said, I'm also suspicious of that her stated goals might not be her true goals. She is focusing on tropes and one-off game mechanics when she could be praising what certain games are doing right and encouraging that. She could be focusing on positive elements of how women are portrayed in games, as there are numerous strong female protagonists, but instead she is focusing on the negative aspects. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. You want to win over gamers, show them what works-- not what doesn't. Gamers know what doesn't work. It's reflected in sales, public reception, and other such things. Even female gamers.

But if my suspicions turn out to be correct, then yes, I want her to stop. She is only serving herself.

I criticise because I see what she's trying to achieve, and she could achieve so much more by taking a slightly different path. She's literally running short on material because she's focusing on the negative.

"Hmm. So first Ferguson didn’t lead to any policy changes. . . . Oh it did? Well I still am justified in my feelings that those changes didn't have anything to do with the movement that occurred there. 

Short history lesson. 

After the Civil War, Union troops occupied the south in order to ensure that the former confederacy complied with federal law. After abandonment of Reconstruction, southern states began revoking black citizenship state by state until these laws were codified and legitimized by the Supreme Court
. Before the [Classic Civil Rights Movement]( http  (from 1954-1968)
 began, there were campaigns against lynchings with high profile articles written and many lawsuits. This was common practice until the 60s when with the aid of more accessible television coverage and one of the most liberal Supreme Courts
 in American History MLK emerged as a towering figure on the back of unprecedented boycotts
, sit ins
, demonstrations
, and marches. The period was also marked countless
 riots
, bombings
and
assassinations. It all culminated in the signings of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
 and the Voting Rights act of 1965. 

Now, can you tell me which of those countless factors is the one that tipped that actually led to meaningful changes in the lives of African-Americans?

A friend recently introduced to the philosopher named Habermas. The premies of one of his theories is that the superior argument will simply win out in the end. Criticism of his theory is that in reality, it doesn’t really work because there are competing interests and power structures that make it impossible for discussions on certain issues to even be had, and for people to simply ignore the truth of certain ideas because they compete with their own desires. You seem to be applying this theory to social movements and politics in general. 

I notice that there is this tendency from supposedly well-meaning conservatives to zero in on one event and make that in and of itself irrelevant or the only thing that happened (like signing a bill into law), while ignoring the literal and figuratice blood that had to be spilled for that piece of legislation to even be considered in a serious way. 

Perhaps the issue is that conservatives tend to reject bottom up social change as a matter of principal, and are always encouraging liberals to become more part of the establishment in order to enact reforms. This happens a lot, and besides being how many social issues die via [recuperation]( http 
, this perspective totally ignores the inherent conflicts of interests involved in reforming a system that is structured to benefit certain powerful interests and squash those who threaten those interests or challenge their autonomy. Operating within the system is not possible, when the system is designed to suppress certain view points and groups of people. 

The part of the story I neglected to mention earlier with regard to MLK was that his protests and methods never received the approval of recalcitrant White America while they were occurring.
The basic premise of your post is based on the specious assumption that if something does not have your conservative stamp of approval, it must be objectively useless or not optimal in its functionality. The truth is to the contrary. That you knew about a protest and it irritated you and other conservatives is a good sign since there’s plenty in the historical record to indicate that trying to discipline protest movements into accepting establishment narratives about how to solve the problem are par for the course during times of social change. Conservative White America is hardly the yard stick that by which the efficacy of protests should be measured.

These ""Christian"" denominations all take the bible as their doctrine. Please show me a major Christian sect that denies the bible is the word of god and their doctrine. Science contradicts the bible, thus science contradicts Christian doctrine.

Yes, as is only stated in the bible, which is the Christian doctrine, which is contradicted by science.

You are saying that a human being dying and coming back from the dead 3 days later is compatible with science? HAHAHAHAHAHA

I don't know what games you're playing, but Blizzard is extremely circle jerky about players having a 50% win rate. Every professional SCII player I look at stats wise either has + or - 50% across the board, or something else insane like a 70% win rate against a specific race, with the other two being significantly lower. When you are of comparable skill level at the top, there's no definitive player who wins 100% of the time. There are stints of time where specific players dominate because they have a grasp and mastery of the current meta, but the minute that meta goes into a paradigm shift and they aren't as proficient they may take a dive. In fact its so common in SCII, that a lof ot players will have these amazing tournament runs, and then get patched into obscurity because their meta is over. They even coined the phrase ""That player is a Patch (Terran,Protoss,Zerg).""

I don't think you're comprehending what I'm getting at. Being good doesn't always scale. In SCII in particular, there's a point where the game goes from being strictly strategic, and adds in an intense element of micro and macromanagement. After a certain point, you risk playing so fast you get tunnel vision. That's not the experience I want, because I find it to be soulless. There's still a lot to learn from pros despite that.

Gaddafi and Hussain were dictators and tyrants just like Assad is today. However, both kept the likes of ISIS in check, and were used by the west in proxi hot/cold conflicts to fight off others who in our eyes were greater threats. Toppling these dictators lead to thousands of deaths in Libya and over half a million in Iraq, and gave ISIS a real foot hold in the region.

Would you say say racially biased arrests is not a pressing issue or would you say that the existing big pharma lobby and opiate pain killers are not a pressing issue?

Lets also not forget how the prohibition of this substance is allowing money to go straight in the hands of drug cartels who then grow in influence only to peddle more dangerous drugs and further ruin this country when we could rather be using taxed marijuana to fund education. Marijuana which is a schedule 1 drug (really it should not be because it has medical utility) has resistance from the DEA because how else can they justify taking so much of the tax payers money (which otherwise would put many of them out of a job) when that can instead be diverted to rehab centres to make people actually better. Really it is not just a hippie movement or stoner movement trying to legalise marijuana but rather impacts and starts to address many issues progressives care about so please never call it smart again to curtail such a movement for progress simply because it saved a president from giving republicans ammunition.

"> What two things can't be true? Are you saying lorentz transformations prove time is a spatial dimension?

No, Lorentz transformations were a practical way to answer a pressing question that predated relativity. As it happens, the method produced results consistent with observation, and as Special Relativity took shape around it, it led to the idea that time is a dimension orthogonal to the space dimensions, something Minkowksi was first to notice.

> I don't know how you came to that conclusion, because I definitely don't see it.

Here is a brief exposition on the Lorentz transformation in the context of Special Relativity: Reference frames, coordinates and the Lorentz transformation

Briefly, and limiting ourselves to one spatial dimension and time:

[; t' = \gamma(t - \frac{v x}{c^2}) ;]

-- and --

[; x' = \gamma(x - v t) ;]

-- where --

[; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} ;]

-- and x' and t' are transformed space and time at velocity v.

If one thinks through the geometry expressed above as Minkowski did, one quickly sees that it describes X and T as orthogonal, i.e. as dimensions, and the spacetime relation is more efficiently expressed as a four-dimensional system.

Minkowski's contribution to Special, and later General, Relativity was recognized as a great simplification compared to what preceded it, a time when people were treating space and time as geometrically orthogonal without realizing what that meant.

> There are a portion of physicists, who in all likelihood are more knowledgeable than you on the subject, that do not consider it the same type of dimension as the spatial dimensions.

Hold on -- I never claimed otherwise. The claim that time is a dimension, and the claim that it is identical to spatial dimensions, are different claims. I already showed that time is treated differently:

[; r = \sqrt{t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2} ;]

This classic spacetime equation makes it obvious that time, although a dimension, is not a space dimension. But you are trying to say that, because time is not a spatial dimension,. therefore it's not a dimension at all.

> There is no method of moving through time like we move through the spatial dimensions ...

You speak as though places you can't personally visit don't exist. So am I correct that, for you, there is no inside to the earth, on the ground that it's inaccessible? Am I correct in assuming that you reject string theory out of hand on the ground that there are six additional spatial dimensions (the upcoming M theory has seven) that are not accessible in the conventional sense? How about times other than the present -- do you reject the past and the future on the ground that you cannot go there? This raises solipsism to an art form.

You need to ask, not whether you can go there, but whether some aspect of physics requires it. Physical theory requires that time be a dimension.

" > the exchange of capital that you've previously produced but not yet consumed (your supply)

You don't understand the meaning of the word ""capital"", and I'm hesitant about whether you know the meaning of the word ""supply"", so first I'm going to clarify the meaning of the word ""demand"".

Demand is the willingness or ability to buy a product at some point in time. The ability part signifies that you have something to trade for that product. The willingness part signifies that you are willing to pay a certain price for a product. The supply of a product affects the demand for a product according to the well-known law of demand.

The last sentence there means that supply is on a per-product basis. Supply is the amount of a product that producers can sell at a given time, if they are willing. What determines the supply? The producers' capital, which are the goods that a producer needs to supply a product (without being used up utterly). In the case where the product supplied is apples, capital may include apple trees, for loans, cash on hand.

> What I was getting at is the Redditor's original idea that we have a ""lack of demand"" is in reality just a lack of means, or supply. It is not like we humans suddenly decided we wanted less things out of life. The problem or ""pain"" felt by what the Redditor reffered to as a ""lack of demand"" is really just analagous to having 5 apples but wanting to do something that would require 6 apples.

A ""lack of demand"" can mean one of two things, given the definition of demand: a lack of ability or a lack of willingness to buy a product (at a given price, that is). Who does this affect? People who are trying to sell apples. Not people who are trying to buy apples! Since people are either unable to afford as many apples as they like or already have as many apples as they want (if not more), prices fall, because otherwise people who sell apples will not sell enough apples to buy another product that they, in turn, need.

> I am now able to demand more goods and services from my other members in the community with which to potentially try and create new wealth. If I did that then yes, I would be creating supply.

So the transaction itself does not improve production of any good, but instead merely redistributes wealth. Since the original owners of that wealth are just as able to spend money as I am (this neglects transaction costs, which is a standard assumption), how is my willingness to buy goods different from their willingness to buy goods? If there's no difference, it means there's no difference in demand OR supply. Is this valuable economic activity?

One way in which it can differ is that since you're a farmer, you have no demand for food because you will grow all the food you need (and therefore don't BUY any from anyone else). However, I am not a farmer, and I buy your food from you cheap, since your supply of food is very plentiful. I can then sell that food to others who have a demand for food as well, and pocket the difference, since I had the money to buy all your food first, which was entirely paid back later.

Out of everyone who buys apples cheap and sells them dear, unless they're taking money from people who aren't doing this, someone ends up buying them extremely expensively and having to sell it off for damn cheap. As you correctly point out, they are providing a useful service: they earn money from improper pricing, and therefore fix the prices of things to correct levels. But they are also moving money away from other people. The concern is that the amount of money flowing from producers to people who are not producers is crippling the demand for goods because people who want goods can't afford them."

If you want to focus on the word ""special"", let's do so: ""Special: better, greater, or otherwise different from what is usual."".

Normal pulls posts, where you're showing off the cool stuff out of the box you just bought? Won't be allowed anymore. That's kinda overkill on the rules, don't you think? One of the whole reasons I even hang out on this sub is because I don't really have anywhere else to talk about my Yugioh goingson. So if I buy some packs and get something awesome? I want to share it with people who will understand instead of talking about it to friends who have no idea what I'm saying. Like I recently bought a Cosmo Blazer Special Edition, hoping to get like... a Tenki or two for my potential Bujin deck, maybe a Bear for trades. I wound up with an Ultimate Rare Tiger King. So of course I was excited and wanted to tell people who actually care about it (and someone joined in on the thread telling me they too would be getting some Cosmo Blazer and would be posting their pulls shortly). 

If you would look at the discussion thread which is literally actually meant for the discussion of this proposed change, you'd see that someone recently suggested some sort of weekly pulls thread. That sort of thread was in consideration early on before the final implementation of the weekly threads, and likely could see a comeback with this new proposed rules, so you would still have an outlet to share those sorts of things.

> Overall, it feels like the rules are getting a bit too restrictive. I understand that there's a need to try and keep things ""in order"". But guess what? This is Reddit. It has a system for that built in already. If a thread doesn't generate any discussion? It will either be downvoted or won't stay on the main page for long. 

The point of the rules is so we don't have to rely on a easily manipulated voting system. The voting system on reddit is far from perfect, and with this subreddit being so small and inactive, it isn't like a topic will disappear off the front page in a matter of hours. It will stay up there. Hell, there have been posts down in the negatives that have been in the top 25 of this subreddit. Downvotes are not enough to discourage disallowed content.

That, and this argument is really weak. If downvotes were all it took to take care of posts which shouldn't be encouraged, why would any subreddit bother having rules at all? 

> And R/F posts and Pulls posts are a mainstay of the sub. 

Ha, pulls being a mainstay? They're allowed here, but it'd be an outright embarrassment if what our subreddit was known for was just pulls posts. R/F posts? Yeah, those are a big deal, and the rules in place a meant to improve upon their content.

The fact you are saying this shows how little you understand reddit still.

> I mean, FFS, we've got links enabled now so that people can post random Yugioh Youtube videos and imgur links to memes. Why are we trying to make the text posts so restrictive? 

Maybe if you actually read the rules, you'd see that youtube spam and memes aren't allowed either.

Secondly, so your problem, in a post about rape, is that I apparently wrongly added the word ""explicitly"" (which I notice I never actually used in the post you are responding to). Ok. I'm pretty sure that I went over this in excruciating detail in the post above, to the point of annoyance, but I'll say it again in perhaps a clearer form. I think, and any reasonable person in this situation would think,""I want to have sex with a condom on"" is the exact same thing as ""I don't want to not have sex with a condom on"", and is clearly meant as such. Only when a philosophers and a logicians are having postal sex with later analysis in mind would this be slightly controversial. If you're saying that there is a difference between two, but the first implicitly implies the other, then we come to the base of our disagreement. We would have to agree to disagree. With that in mind, let me ask you this: What do you think ""explicitly"" forbidding someone to not put a condom on would sound like.

I'm not going to comment on the ""legitimate rape"" part of your post.

Edit: PS: I almost forgot the most hilarious part. Expressly does not necessarily mean explicitly. It can also mean clearly, directly, unambiguously etc. in this context. Regardless of what you think about her verbalization of lack of consent, you are arguing against something that does not necessarily exist.

"> deploying trunk of any software strikes me as a really bad idea

If by ""deploying trunk"" you mean blindly doing an `svn up` on the production servers every few hours/days, then sure. But if you mean checking out a particular revision and sticking to it for a while, upgrading when some feature or bug you cared about lands, then no, ""deploying trunk"" is just fine.

In a larger sense I think this is a mindset issue: there are plenty of projects which have no problems breaking `HEAD` and leaving it broken for a while, and so people naturally develop a strong aversion to it. But there are just as many projects which take a strong stance on keeping trunk stable, which isn't hard if you're a bit strict about it.

In the case of Django, for example, the policy for trunk is that no feature gets checked in without documentation and a passing test suite, and there's a buildbot running 24 hours a day to verify the full test suite after every commit. Significant features get done in a branch, and merge back only when complete and tested.

And so Django's trunk is remarkably stable; many people -- including Debian -- regularly snapshot it and deploy/distribute it. It's not like this is rocket science..."

"Yes, psychics and fortune-tellers are full of shit, I agree.

The tarot is not about that, not even a little. If you attempt to tell someone their future, you are a charlatan and nothing more.

My life has been irrevocably changed for the better as a result of working with it, through it, and seeing life from its lens. I see life, all interactions, all changes, all experiences symbolically. I don't read cards to tell my future, I read them to understand myself, and what I've learned. I read cards for others to do the same, to provide a symbolic context in their life, to connect them and empower them with mythological and esoteric symbolism. I am not a psychic, and I make that clear to everyone I work with. More or less, I am a symbolic co-engineer of consciousness. Symbols change consciousness. Consider the crucifix, corporate logos, countries' flags, the symbols on the dollar bill. Do you really think these are there to just be pretty? They do things to your subconscious. 

Look at the work CG Jung did with the tarot and archetypes. His psychology is real psychology. Freud never cured or helped anyone, any success he claimed was fabricated and full of shit. Look it up.

Ultimately it is subjective, but subjectivity is the way we all experience reality. We all have our individual experiences. When you connect to something symbolic and inherently mystical like the tarot, and use it as a guide, to affirm and explore the present, to empower you, you connect with something larger than yourself in your myopic bubble. Life becomes more than just making money, fucking, and dying. Life becomes a mystical classroom of experience, one where you can witness what lessons you are learning, where you receive homework, where you get graded. 

I suggest you try reading from the I-Ching, or something with less ""woo-woo"" connotations than the tarot. You may yet discover something that will open your subjective experience to a new realm of possibility for personal growth.

Skepticism is healthy. Indeed, I am an occultist and also a skeptic. But ultimately the materialist perspective that science has thus far cultivated cannot explain everything, it cannot reduce the world to an unintelligent material model, as much as it tries to. You will only come to learn certain things by exploring them yourself, by directly experiencing them. Once you have a gnostic experience, you will realize the error of materialist thinking. Or you can just ignore it and go through life knowing absolutely nothing, trusting others to imprint you with their notions of existence. You may understand certain concepts or ideas, but you won't know anything, really."
"You have an easy job you enjoy and ample time to spend on your hobby store and the financial security of a high stress STEM job without any of the stress.

Of course YOU dont want a divorce. 

Youre being vague about how big the income gap is. A decent STEM job can easily make over $60k, even over 6 figures. In my experience church positions generally arent more than $30k. So he likely makes at least twice what you do. And he has HUGE income potential while yours is very limited. 

And that can work... But it can also lead to big resentment. Especially when your whole argument is ""Hard work is okay for you but I want to have fun"". It sounds like he feels that he's subsidizing your hobbies and feels taken advantage of.

He has literally said that. Doing charity to keep busy and some crafts projects is what housewives do. 

You can tell us not to jump to divorce all you want: Your husband is not happy and is on the divorce path.

I would suggest couples counselling and seeing a financial advisor. 

> I contribute equally to our household finances

Okay, how? Is the income gap smaller than I guessed? In which case why arent you specifying it? If he makes $40k and you make $30k plus $6k crafts then he is a MAJOR jackass. 

Are you two keeping to a lower standard of living so you can feel like an equal contributor? If so that may be part of his frustration. He wants to reap the rewards of his hard work and has to limit himself just so you can feel equal.

"That's a wonderful story about how you use your phone. Unfortunately it doesn't apply to me or many others.

>The first time this came up, it was a difference of 20%, but it came out that the methodology of the test was flawed.

Could you elaborate on the ""methodology of the test was flawed""? Geekbench presented only two data points. It wasn't a scientific test. No one claimed it was. They used the results to spearhead better research - which they are now collecting. Additionally, the difference was indeed 30%. It was also 20%. The TSMC chips represented a 30% improvement to battery life over the Samsung chip, while the Samsung chip represented a 20% decrease in battery life over the TSMC chip. Both numbers are correct, depending on whether you are using the Samsung or TSMC chip as the benchmark.

One thing we can both agree on is that we require more data. Currently we have statistically valid proof that there is significant bifurcation (two distinct battery results). The extent of this is currently being tested, and I am eager to see the results."
"1. People were learning Japanese in the '80s and '90s because the Japanese economy was booming. Now they're switching to Chinese for the same reason. I think the comparison is accurate, and as soon as another economy overtakes the Chinese as the new new thing there will be a push to study that country's language.

2. Characters and tones are ""stupid"". They are certainly not as functional as their equivalents, i.e. an alphabet and longer words with more phonemes. Reed has hit on something here, since noted (non-Chinese) Chinese scholars such as John De Francis and Victor Mair have advocated switching to pinyin, or at least having it as a legitimate alternative. The literacy rate in China could be so much higher. BTW if you believe the government's figures on literacy I've got some swampland in Florida to sell you.

3. Mandarin is not spoken by all Chinese, though it may be understood by most of them. If you're doing business in Guangzhou or Hong Kong it's not going to get you very far.

4. For that reason, studying Mandarin doesn't get you very far. I have studied Chinese for the better part of ten years. My wife is Chinese. Yet I can't watch a movie or TV show all the way through without my brain being strained from the amount of words to look up later. This is not the case with Spanish, a language I also speak. So what did I really get from all those years of study besides the ability to speak Chinglish with my wife?

And let me make this clear. I am not mad at Kesha. I am mad at YOU. Why? Because of your fucking ignorant comment about how the ""OP spent more time fiddling with MS paint than actually doing something that can be called research"" Well guess what. The little bit of time he did invest into going on wikipedia and just attempting to check her background is more than YOU ever did to bring to light some discrepancies in Kesha's statement and to point out how retarded some redditors are comparing her to Einstein when the most she's ever contributed to society are her self-proclaimed ""douchey"" songs. So lets do the math here. I'm arguing against YOU, on the basis that you haven't done shit but you're just being an overall fucktard with your sarcastic comments like, ""I keep empirical evidence of my intelligence on my person's at all times."" and shitting on the OP's noble attempt at a background check and to fix some false notions about how smart Kesha is.

">Ironically, the commandments you are claiming we must follow are part of the 613 commandments of the Mosaic Law - including water baptism.

( http #Maimonides'_list) and I never claimed that we have to follow any commandments apart from what Christ gave us.

>BTW, in Romans 4, Paul uses Abraham, who didn't have the Mosaic Law, and was still justified by faith first

You're not getting to what faith is in the first place, which is odd, because your first excerpt in your response is a statement I made after explaining what faith necessarily has to be even if you wanted to simplify it into ""a trust in Christ"". You also do this with my given citation of 1 Peter, and you still give no reason for us to believe your exegesis and the techniques therein with which you come to your conclusion, versus clear verses that have been unambiguously understood in the way that I, DKowalsky, and many others throughout even the earliest centuries of Christianity understand them.

Instead you become more aggressive.

>Blindly following a tradition over the actual word of God is worse.

There's no blind following of tradition-- the regenerative capacity of baptism is capable of being Scripturally supported-- and always is.

>And like a good Catholic,

I'm not Catholic (does anybody care about flair, anymore), and Catholics aren't the only ones who believe in regenerative baptisms-- far from it.

>you resort to belittling your opponents

You couldn't even tell that I wasn't Catholic, exposing yourself as doing this. DKowalsky didn't have to make assumptions about your affiliations to make his point, and neither did I, and so neither of us did. On the other hand, you've consistently done so.

I didn't think calling someone ""lame"" was a kind of belittling; I made sure to choose a term that didn't actually sting, because my point was to say that you were being a self-righteous jerk about this entire thing, not to insult you.

>Kind of like how your Pope has recently belittled the victims of that wicked, corrupt abomination called the Roman Catholic Church.

Seeing as what I explained before about myself, this is a really ridiculous jab-- the fact that the Pope did no such thing notwithstanding (the Vatican already disciplined the prime offender years back, but there wasn't an investigation for the alleged accomplice, so the Pope ended up saying that the accusations without evidence amount to slander-- which is the case, however inelegant he phrased it, because we should presume innocence; that's hardly a belittling, even if the victims (alleged or truly) take it that way).

>They aren't exceptions, they're consistent with what Christ said in John 3:16.

And John 3:16 needs to be measured with what He said in [John 3:3-8], [John 14:23], [Mark 16:16], [Matthew 28:19], [Matthew 16:24-26], and perhaps some other relevant ones that don't immediately come to mind.

>And if there are exceptions, there isn't any rule.

The forms (e.g. baptism, the Eucharist) are for us-- it doesn't mean that God is ontologically incapable of saving outside of that rule (e.g. the wise thief). In order to say such, you have to yourself limit God."

Is this your first year watching the Ravens? You only have to go back a couple of years and give Joe half competent offensive core and a actual line and he had MANY great years.

You are taking a small example of Joe checking it down. Would it occur to you that is maybe how the offense is running? Have you not listened to previous players talk about it AKA Pitta.

Your thought process would be correct if you had actual evidence if Joe had a resume of being shit with weapons, but you don't have that.

Of course my comments are merely what I think subjectively, as is any other person's comments. I expected disagreement no matter what I said. Perk skills come down to personal preference, and I'm of course not trying to state ""X is bad, Y is better"", but rather than from my own experience I find one slightly more useful than the other. I don't doubt that Commando's stumble skill is effective, I just find the fast switch speed really useful for switching between primaries, mass-extending zed-time, and I like to have juiced-up 9mms for the early waves and then as emergency backup for later waves. 

I also don't think it's reasonable to assume that I'm ""inexperienced"" just because I find use in other skills which fit my play style. I'm not inexperienced, I play perfectly fine with the skills I pick and can survive each wave with little issue if my team is competent (it's rare that I have bad teammates). I play exclusively on HoE (sometimes Suicidal if there are no HoE servers that fit my filter criteria), and given that my teammates are good, we can just play through with minimal issues. Sometimes there are deaths, but that's just the nature of the game, things can and will go wrong sometimes and there's usually little one can do over it.

I also disagree with you saying that Impact Rounds is objectively better than Fallback, because I would be using it if that were the case, as would everyone else. I personally don't need the extra stumble as I don't engage directly with large zeds; there are other perks which are better equipped at taking them out. I've tried both skills and overall prefer Fallback; 50% faster switch speed alone makes it worth taking, just for being able to quickly cycle between my weapons (and syringe even) which makes everything that much easier in the heat of the moment, and having the otherwise weak 9mm turned into a reliable backup weapon is a big plus."
"Yes insulting isn't always best. Alas, after going to the gym and watching what very terrible athletic trainers have their people do on a day to day basis - i'm past the point of civility with weightlifting ignorance. People handing out bad advice on weightlifting should be shamed for putting people in positions which can have real affects on their health in the future.

But trying to explain to you where and why you're wrong is a long and arduous task which at the end of the day isn't worth the effort. If people want to listen to the wrong advice, put themselves in harms way, and not get the most out of their program that's their own business. There's plenty of very good literature out there worth reading when it comes to weight lifting and biomechanics. Hell if you put 20 minutes of effort into it i'm sure you can figure it out. Though like most people who spout random crap - i'm sure the effort will never manifest. I'm not going to attempt to parse all that because you have bad methodologies from your good ole' high school days.

Weight training in the context of health, strength, power etc works because you are putting strain on your body. Continued and increased strain is necessary for growth. These aren't new concepts. Different muscle groups in your body have different output and some peak quicker than others. That doesn't mean you just quit doing an exercise because a supplemental muscle group isn't big enough to match the output of something like the quadriceps. At some point in training beyond that of a novice it will reach a point where it is better to drop the weight rather than try and lower the weight on muscle groups or bone structure which isn't particularly strong at doing the reverse motion (Shoulders are one of these). 

You don't make people do reverse strict press because 1. It's stupid and doesn't provide any muscular benefit that can't be achieved else where 2. it's dangerous because past a point (very low point mind you) it becomes more risk than reward for the muscles and joints in the shoulders. Which is why people do heavy presses, generally, on risers. Additionally they usually use their legs to catch the weight more than anything else and ""let it drop"" to their shoulders.

Now strict press is usually done from a rack so we'll move on to another exercise to continue the point. The JERK, also known as the second part of the Clean and Jerk. Which depending on the method you used puts you in a similar position as the strict press with a large weight above your head. Why not lower down? Well I just told you. You can, especially at lower weights, but doing so at higher weights is needlessly risky. It is 1000000000000x safer and sound to drop the weight. But this isn't a cartoon okay? We're not sitting there looking up at the weight and dropping it on our head. You drop the weight by taking a step back while releasing your hold on the weight. Watch the video of Dimas for a visual. Why do we step back and release? Well here's something really simple. If an object with weight is released in mid air, and no other forces besides gravity are acting upon it what happens? Oh right, it falls straight down, because physics. I release, I step back, bar goes straight down. The magic of science every time. When does it not do this? When I try to do something silly like hold on to the bar and apply a force in a direction which is not straight down. Now take a step back.... what if I want to be a cool guy and try and reverse the weight down? Well I could and it could work out just fine. Or, more importantly, I could fuck it up because I technically completed the lift with my arms locked and fully supporting the weight appropriately but decided to unlock my arms, put strain on my muscle groups, and make a movement which at the end of the day serves no real purpose. Do you remember the last time you tried to lower a heavy weight onto your face? Yeah neither do I.


So lets get back to the fucking bar and weights. 1. Bumper plates and ringed plates are meant to be dropped - lets throw that out there. They are wrapped in rubber/polymer precisely so when they fall they do not cause structural damage to the actual weight itself nor to the floor/surface they fall on. 

Now comes the funny/ironic part. Sorry, I won't be typing out the physics for you but lets pretend you're competent enough to understand. Bar and weights fall down straight because of gravity. Simple. They hit the floor, newtonian physics takes place, and in all likelihood the bar moves... maybe a half inch from its initial falling place... maybe. Let's watch Lu Xiaojun drop his weight. Doesn't move much does it? Gravity, friction, the fact that he's lifting >300 lbs above his head.... it's like magical forces and stuff. So whats funny? The funny thing is... the only real time you should not drop the bar with weight is when the weights on the plate are light e.g. you're loading with 10kg, 15kg,... maybe 20 kg (It's probably fine unless you have a shitty bar) plates because the weight distribution on those skinny weights lends itself to awkward falls and the bar can jump around a bit. You can still drop it, and around 60kg you probably should, but you know what you do? You guide the bar down. You let it fall but you don't completely remove your hands. It drops, if it hops your arms correct it. Boom. Weight dropped, nothing damaged, no added stress for no fucking reason on your body.


Now for the next ridiculous point. Is everyone an Oly Lifter? Nope. Does that matter? Nope. We're discussing the safety of dropping the weights and whether its necessary to put yourself or someone else and their body in a compromised position because your High School Coach probably did as much reading into proper weightlifting as you did.

Second ridiculous point. If you're really going to justify putting yourself/someone else in a bad spot and/or limiting their weightlifting progression because of ""gym worst case senarios"" then .... yeah i'm at a loss for words. None of this is hard. Dropping weights (bumper plates etc) is completely safe provided you're not a jerkoff... but hey maybe there are some high school football kids who want to pelvic thrust on their cleans, who knows. When you're at the gym whether you're cleaning, snatching, deadlifting or squatting you should always be aware of your surroundings. You don't fucking squat when someone is standing right behind you do you? No. That's dangerous and stupid. Just like I don't fucking clean and jerk when theres a guy standing in front of me trying to remember what Coach Jimmy told him about his hamstrings on the deadlift. The gym is a dangerous place. There are people moving weight. Pay attention and don't be a dumbass - but just because it's a dangerous place isn't a justification for you to be stupid, do stupid things, and tell other people to do stupid things which are far more likely to hurt them.

"Why be a country? Because like you said, it's important to protect the rights of people when it becomes clear that there needs to be someone stepping in. Prior to the civil war, people didn't consider the country as one, they viewed it as a collection of states. The idea that the country should control anything is actually rather new. It sounds like a subject you'd be interested in and I recommend looking into the different theories and philosophies. Some founding fathers thought the federal government should do nothing but control the military to protect the states and make sure everyone got along. Others thought the states should hardly exist and the federal government should be the end all be all. All sides have great points. Personally, I like the separation of each state. I like that if I want a a law that allows me to do something, I only need to convince half of my state instead of half of the country, especially when what i want might not even affect them and lead to apathy.

>How's catering to moderates working out for the DNC? How many seats have they won lately?

Catering to moderates is how Democrats won control of the House and Senate in 2006, and won historic majorities and the White House in 2008. What has the Bernie wing ever won? If you show Democrats that progressives can win, then you'll see the party rush to be more progressive. Power respects victory. Nothing else. 

Elected officials generally have strong opinions in two or three policy areas (different politicians care about different issues), and are flexible on everything else. On issues where they don't care that much, they will take the positions that they think are most likely to help them win. If they're not taking your position, then you haven't proved to them that it's a winning issue. It's that fucking simple.

Yes the lack of identity is huge for people like me who grew up as children of expats, we don't want to leave that place because we grew up there and have friends, place and things we love there but at the same time we can't stay there forever so we are forced to move abroad or back home, and in my case moving back home is just not something that many people would choose, once you get used to living in a first world country, its hard to readjust to Bangladesh.

> Now I might just be talking out of my ass here, but I think you face a quite bit of self-hate for your own culture and look down upon it, as is natural with those of you who grow up in countries where the majority of Bangladeshis are low-wage workers. You distance yourself from ""them"" and due to normal classist behaviour, you internally and externally have made yourself something as far from Bangladesh as possible because of your constant need to put yourself ""above"" those low-wage construction workers, cause you have convinced yourself you share nothing in common with them.

Unfortunately, you are talking out of your ass in this case. I have no disrespect for the working class, infact I give the fakirs and street beggers and rickhaw walas generous amounts of money, like 50-100 taka because for me it is chump change, If anything the way the poor are treated in this country by other people in this country disgusts me. Even back home the low wage workers get no shit from me at all because their work makes my comfortable life possible.

Your parents are Bangladeshi, so no matter how much you've attempted to become an anti-Bangladeshi, some of the aspects of the culture must have rubbed off on you. This all is very natural.

I am not anti-Bangladeshi, I am against some parts of Bangladeshi culture because some of the values of the culture don't align with my western individualist values. And my western values are not from UAE, it's not a western country, its because I have read books and sought knowledge and adopted those values on my own. 

Bangladesh has a lot of sins on its shoulders and I simply try to separate myself from those. I can do that without hating the people or the country of itself. 

> My advice is, attempt to understand who you are, first. But as I can tell from your post, you have no interest in living in this country, and it is impossible to truly embrace your culture when distancing yourself from it. You are attributing corruption, traffic, and dirty roads to my people's culture, instead of understanding what poverty, colonialism, and poor governance have actually done. Of course, my culture has positives and negatives, and if you don't attempt to understand, embrace, and learn both aspects, you're just slightly above a tourist. I don't recommend someone like you, who has an internal hatred for the country of your parent's origin, to marry someone from Bangladesh because your culture (whatever it currently is) will inevitably clash with there's and it won't be pretty. Maybe if you can find a girl like you who is of Bangladeshi origin, but is also a self-hating foreigner, you might prefer that.

You are becoming overly emotional here. 

Poiting out facts is not ""self-hating"". In UAE I can travel 200 kilometres in 2 hours, in BD I would be lucky if I can travel 20 in that time. SO the traffic condition is horrible. And streets are dirty there is no denying that. 

No amount of ""governance"" will fix those. Believe me, it has to come from the people. Why don't people drive properly and not throw trash? The number of people I saw throwing trash in the beautiful nature of Sylhet really pissed me off, they ruined places like Jaflong and Bisnakandi with trash, they could have thrown it in the dustbins but they were too lazy to wait 5 minutes, you think the government will change that?

What about the roads?? Why were the roads fine when the students were protesting, the moment they left the roads went back into chaos? Same roads man, maybe because the people don't want to follow laws if no one is enforcing them? That's why. 

In fact the blaming of goverment, the British and Pakistan is precisely one of the things I hate, look man none of those things are stopping you from not literring, following traffic laws and many other things, don't blame outside forces for all your issues its pathetic.

"You always can email me and I'd be happy to join your discussion. No problem. Just found it this morning. 

The folks at Reddit are hardly my ""handlers"". They are editors, and in the /r/science thread they need to keep the discussion evidence based and on topic. Certainly you are one of the many that feel a need to discredit me, and I understand. I clearly communicate science to the public. Since you can't argue with data and evidence, attack the messenger. I get that. It is a low-rent, ad hominem tactic that immediately discredits your argument. 

That's why they didn't allow your comment. It was not to discuss the science, it was to smear me with nonsense, based on zero evidence. 

The funny part is, I never got anything from Monsanto toward my research, not a cent. My record is public and every cent accountable, with almost all of it coming from Federal or State organizations (you). 

You can certainly find places where researchers at my university have found funding from a company, Monsanto or others. But this is the point-- that funding goes to their program to do research associated with that project. It is not like they spread it out to everyone! 

I wish! We'd all get $200, enough to buy a case of test tubes. 

The bottom line is two points:

1. Individual programs do get funding from companies to answer specific research questions. 

2. Even if Monsanto funded everything I did, it would not change the science or what I reported. See, you might not know this, but there's this quality called ""integrity"". It is really important to some of us. I know it is not shared by those who find it reasonable to try to bring professional harm to a public scientist. 

So there you have it. I work for you. If you don't like the message, then maybe your ideas might be wrong. Consider that. I'd be glad to answer any questions on the science of GM technology.

Umm, pretty sure if one group is disadvantaged and another group is not that puts the group that's not disadvantaged at an advantage. That's kind of how things work. 

> Regardless, I refuse to argue with you about whether or not women have it worse or not in the West.

I only argue this because this stupid shit about men's right's only and always pops up in response to some discussion of women's rights. It's like whenever a woman complains about something that men do, some dipshit man pops up and needs to be patted on the head and assured that no, not all men do that. 

> Making everything a women's issue solves nothing and only serves to disregard that men also face issues and that women are capable of being anything but victims.

Or it's a recognition of the current power balance in the world we live in and trying to direct the response to the root of the problem rather than just trying to enforce some false equality. Take custody for instance. It's wrong that women are routinely awarded custody over men even when the facts of the situation don't support that, but if we just start trying to enforce some rules that artificially prevent that without attacking the real problem, i.e. traditional roles of men/women in parenting then the outcome is always going to be less than ideal and virtually impossible to actually enforce. 

> Neither of these are effective solutions to these issues.

Social pressure is incredibly powerful, want an example, go litter in public. I'll bet you can't even bring yourself to do it, and the reaction you get will be surprisingly strong.

No they're not, they're the same fucking thing so starting a second movement is absolutely counter productive bullshit and needs to fucking stop. Want men's rights? Support feminism, which is about putting men and women on equal footing. Don't sulk in the corner and start your own movement because you feel like your not getting enough attention, instead try to understand women's struggles and I guarantee you'll start to understand that the root cause of men's rights issues are the same bullshit that disadvantages women. You don't need a separate movement to fix them. "
"Wikipedia's definition is more complete;

>Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent. The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability or is below the legal age of consent. The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.

Whether or not he actually did that, I don't know. I don't think Monica Lewinsky has ever claimed that Bill Clinton raped her, or committed anything like rape. But a person's authority over another person absolutely can be coercion, and that coercion absolutely can bypass any reasonable understanding of consent.

If a professor threatens to fail a student for not sucking his dick, that would be rape. Obviously the most powerful man on the planet's ability to coerce an intern is much higher than that of a professor coercing a student.

Again, I'm not saying Clinton raped her. But what I am saying is that you saying he couldn't be guilty of rape under the circumstances is absolutely not true."

Instead we'll find every reason that we can come up with except for the obvious one, and if it does come up, there a lot of harrumphing and subject-changing. We want to smoke pot & get high without getting in trouble. Get over yourself and say it, don't push for medical marijuana and then suddenly develop chronic pain with no specific symptoms. You're not fooling anyone.

The other big pro-weed argument is how if weed were legalized, then we could tax it and fix the deficit! Yay, right? Not quite. There are a lot of problems with that: How will you tax it? The same way that we tax cigarettes? That means that there would have to plantations or farms or what have you. That might be okay, but what about the people that want to grow their own? Will there standards; i.e., will the FDA set standards that have to be followed? Will the people that grow their own have to meet these standards? How will you tax the people that grow a little extra to sell to their friends?

Here's something else to consider: if weed were magically legal as of tomorrow, there'd be a whole lot of people out of work. All the dealers, growers, suppliers, etc. would suddenly have to compete with corporations. What happens to them? Do you really think they're going to be happy that all their clients don't have to deal with them any longer?

And then there's the day-to-day concerns. What will the legal age be to legally purchase weed? Will there be a limit on how much you can buy at once? People aren't too fond of smokers these days; how will we deal with people smoking pot in public? How will you deal with people driving while high, or being disorderly while high? Will police officers be able to demand a piss test on the spot? How would that even work?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but even if weed was legal employers would still very likely be able to require drug tests of their employees. Unless there's a good way to determine if someone has smoked in the past few hours (similar to a Breathalyzer test for alcohol), it's entirely reasonable that employers could simply dismiss smokers based on the way drug tests work now, which means if you have smoked in the past few days your job could be in jeopardy.

Finally, the legalizers need to stop quoting bullshit studies and linking to pro-pot websites. Let's see some peer-reviewed journals with legitimate medical doctors presenting evidence (I say this because if I have to read that article written by a physicist one more time I'm choking someone with a hookah. He's not a medical doctor!). If you refer me to a website with ""420"" in the title, pot leaf gifs, or tie-dye backgrounds anywhere on the page, you've instantly lost credibility. No one is going to take anything listed on these websites seriously. Deal with it. Make a boring website where the focus is on the information, not all the users' sweet-ass bongs, man. It will make a huge difference.

Also, people aren't fooled by calling it all your cutesy little nicknames. Grow up and call it what it is. You're not fooling anyone that thinks about it for more than a minute, and by hiding behind a bunch of asinine slang, you're only reinforcing that you have something to hide. Be honest about what you're doing, and you'll gain a lot more respect than you do now. 

These are the things all the legalizers never consider, and it's critical that these questions start having good answers if you want to see marijuana legalized in our lifetime. There's far more to consider than just ""legalizing weed"" and until a dedicated group of people comes together and seriously considers each & every side of the issue and is honest about why they're doing it, marijuana will never be legal.

TL; DR - Weed's not going to be legal until the stoners grow up and deal with all the issues that would be brought about by legalization.

"> That's like your opinion man.

No, it's objective, seeing as you have nothing to substantiate the vast majority of your horrible claims.

> And you stopped reading that paragraph right there didn't you? Like if you are talking about the top of PC Bangs then no, PUBG which is higher is also not a free to play game. Not that in actually matters in PC Bangs, because you get to play the game if you pay for the PC Bang, Blizzard has a deal going where it unlocks OW and other games on the PCs there.

So it's just completely unreliable as far as play numbers are concerned. Good to know.

> The investments are more justified because more people are willing to invest more for less? Ehh that doesn't mean that, it could very easily be a bubble.

No, it can't very easily be a bubble as it turned a profit year one. At the minnimum, the assets are worth more than what was paid for them year 1.

> Yeah but that's only in the US, if you want to go play basketball and be a pro but you hate the NBA you can just go in some other league, in some other country.

Baseball then. It's MLB or bust. Peripheral smaller leagues are not important at all to the health of a sport.

> If you say so, again just your opinion.

some opinions are better than others. In this case mine, since I didn't make something up that goes against conventional wisdom based of no evidence

> Indeed, developing new players and ensuring that esport is a viable career path is not important for the league. And although they have tier 2 or 3 orgs, they do not have the money or tournaments to support those orgs, and their numbers and size are nowhere near what they were before the OWL.

You mean to tell me the year 1 structure didn't measure up to the multi year structure in year 1? You don't say! 

> So by your logic the OWL lost 100k viewers because of ESPN, yet ESPN had worse numbers than they usually do. I really don't follow your train of logic here, shouldn't ESPN have seen higher viewership than average if you say that the OWL did not alienate any of their usual viewers and instead brought in viewers taken from Twitch?

This might be your dumbest paragraph so far, which is really saying something. 

1. There is 0 evidence that they alienated viewers
2. You have not shown me anything to suggest that the numbers are lower than normal for the slot
3. OWL lost ~300k viewers to ESPN

> The playoffs week 1 out of 3 had lower viewership than the stage before it too, unlike any sport.

Except it didn't since you aren't counting ESPN 3 and Disney XD viewers, which took an estimated 150k. So like everything else you've posted, wrong

> No shit the League was profitable, Blizzard got 60 million dollars from the teams to be a part of the League, . If Blizzard get's half then that's 100 million dollars over two years. It cost Riot 50 million to create the LCS, of course the OWL is profitable, it does not mean the teams in it are.

1. The league was profitable for the teams as well
2. Initial investment is not profit rofl. Do you even understand basic accounting and business practices?

> and they are getting another 180 million, on top of 200 million dollars from sponsors and Twitch overpaying them

1. They objectivly did not overpay. The market determined that value and that's what twitch paid, as well as the sponsors
2. If that was an overpay, then they wouldn't be adding new sponsors and streaming options during the season
3. You have no idea how markets and businesses work

> And this League with millions and millions of dollars invested in it, and backed by multiple billionaires should see popularity that goes beyond a normal esport.

And it is. Glad we agree the league is doing just fine

> They don't though, OW without the OWL is getting 20-30k viewers it doesn't matter if there are a hundred pros getting 100 viewers each, the viewership is still abysmal for what is supposed to be a very popular game, meant to support the biggest investment in esports.

Because people like me who watch every OWL game aren't going to watch streamers in the downtime. And 20-30k (if thats the actual number since you've shown a complete inability to consider all factors) is just fine."

I could go into a large explanation of power budgets and the reason why something this volatile and potentially powerful would eat up a larger than normal portion of the power budget for the champion. He would have to be balanced around a situation where he was against a heavy AP opponent and got full stacks. The rest of his kit would have to be held below par to make up for the snowbally nature of his kit. Or how that would make his kit even weaker against AD opponents because even if he was crushing lane he would get outscaled because his passive would be worthless. Or how it encourages really bad gameplay decisions like choosing to kill a weak AP opponent because of the passive instead of the 10/0 adc.

"> I mean is it any more pulled out of my ass than you yourself also saying he was probably voting out Christy no matter what?

LMAO no. The idea to boot Christy came from Rob initially it's clearly not something that Jenna or Heidi proposed to him. We know that from what we saw on screen and we've also seen him give the rationale for booting Christy and why he did it. We also saw his reactions after Christy was booted and literally nothing to suggest that he changed his vote during tribal. That's fanfiction from your end.

In addition he's said this in exit interviews/retrospectives. 

Jenna has never mentioned your entirely baseless percentages that you pull out of nowhere and nothing she has ever said suggested that even factored into her decision.

> I don't think Rob is dumb enough to expect that Heidi would be any more likely to take him to the end and so at that point I think his concern would be who he's likely to beat which we know he considered to be Jenna.

But as I said Jenna already rebuffed him and tried to blow up his spot earlier, she also never gives this rationale in the episode this is entirely you giving your version of why you think she made this move. 

> I do remember it was Survivor 6. Rob is known for being bold in general and if new information presented itself at Tribal Council I see no reason he wouldn't have acted on it, he was hardly playing a Moto Maji type game.

He also has to change Matt's vote at tribal doing so to get majority during that time it's not as simple as you make it out to be. Also during that time the risks of a tie vote were not half as well known Rob and others have stated numerous times that they weren't as sure about the rules back then as we are now. 

> Not stupid if there's no risk. If he was voting out Christy anyway like you say then it was at worst netural.

What are you talking about ? Of course there's a risk by giving away her immunity and becoming the other potential target at that tribal. She received Butch and Christy's votes at that tribal and easily could have been eliminated with Rob's and Matt's. 

If Rob and Matt go into that tribal voting Heidi and Jenna gives away her immunity they are much more likely to stick on Jenna rather than switch their vote to Christy for that tribal as you suggest and it's certainly not no risk - that's just incredulous. 

> Does Jenna ever say that she's doing it for any reason besides keeping herself safe in the episode? No, so literally anything we say would be speculative but like if we look at the pretty clear ways the move benefits her I don't think it's a stretch to say she was aware of them.

In no way does the move benefit her like at all. I would say you're being results oriented but this didn't even have an impact in changing the direction of thee game it has no benefits and the clear downside is she's a very viable boot at that stage. 

There's probably more to suggest that she wanted to quit and didn't mind leaving in the place of Heidi given that we were shown that she was contemplating quitting and also given Christy's 
voting confessional:

> (voting for Jenna) Your wish has come true; you're going home, you're getting a shower, you're eating good food. Go look beautiful, be happy. We don't need you. 

Lol Christy. 

> If this isn't why she did it then why do you think she did exactly?

Either because she didn't mind leaving at that point or because she just wants to extend a friendly gesture to her ally. 

In any case you're missing the point even with the rationale you've given for Jenna (if it's correct) it's still a terrible move and a ridiculous risk to take.

She made herself a viable boot there in a position where she could've been the boot. I think the idea that mastermind Jenna has calculated Rob in such a way that she can accurately peg the percentages that he is likely to do x and y after he successfully blindsided her during the previous round is hilarious.

">It's a slash and burn approach to treating the symptoms, not the disease.

Unfortunately one of the main causes of the disease you mentioned is a relatively slim pool of heroes, it's not slash and burn, it's a band-aid. 

> Well, fair enough, that can be irritating, but if overtime mechanics stay the same, then you'll just wind up with 3 additional heroes with mobility, it will not solve the problem that stacking is symptomatic of.

Secondly this point can be mainly discarded, as overtime was just announced as patched. After 20 seconds the ""fuse"" starts going down much faster, and the respawn timers have been increased. 

>Not only the raging and whining, but what if the enemy has a Bastion? It's a good example of a hero with specific counters and that needs to be dealt with. I'm not good at Widow, Genji or Hanzo, so my go to counter is Pharah, but what if we already have one? Well, either we have to rely on that player to counter, I have to pick something I suck at or we lose. That isn't right.

You're in competitive mode, where everyone needs to pull their own weight, so here's my answer:

Either stay out of competitive until you consider yourself decent enough at multiple heroes, or communicate with your Pharah so that she makes it her number 1 priority to deal with the Bastion. 

If you can't successfully do either of these things, maybe your team didn't deserve to win? 

> What this means is that in competitive mode, you MUST be able to play all heroes really well

First of all, no. This is not the case, and it's pretty obvious you're exaggerating. Let's take your previous example and expand upon it:

Bastion is not an invincible juggernaught against anyone not named Pharah, Genji, Widow, or Hanzo. In fact most if not all of the offensive heroes have a relatively simple time taking him out with the exception of maybe an ult-less Tracer, and even then you have unparalleled mobility. The beauty of an fps with so many heroes is that the counters and matchups are more akin to a fluid than a rigid chart. 

Maybe I'm projecting or being a dick, and if it comes across that way I apologize in advance, but in nearly every strongly competitive multiplayer game (assuming you're in solo-queue where you won't always get your role), you need to be at a competent level for nearly every position. Even in the case of 1-hero type per team you can usually get away with maining 2 or 3 roles.

I'd also like to point out that maining 2 or 3 roles is different from what you said here:

> you can't just have a core of 6 or 7 you really enjoy

For example, there are 6 heroes in the offensive tab alone. 

To become a well rounded player, you can have a core of 6 or 7 heroes, but they need to be spread out enough to cover multiple situations. If learning these different positions doesn't sound fun, or you don't want to put in the work then perhaps competitive mode just isn't for you? 

>It introduces a situation where your own team is the only thing stopping you from removing an enemy threat, which should never, ever be the case.

This ""me vs. the team"" mindset is going to get you nowhere, and the sooner you recognize that, the sooner you'll improve as a player.

"> Many are still operating with outdated pre-clinical ideologies like letter grades, class rank, and mandatory attendance. 

this isn't exclusive to DO schools at all. 

>They cling to outdated concepts like OMM, most schools don’t teach to what is on boards, and often scrape the bottom of the barrel to scrounge up professors. Which amounts to a very poor preclinical foundation unless the students say fuck it, shell out exorbitant amounts of money for external teaching tools like Boards and Beyond, Pathoma, Sketchy 

Most MD students shell out about a thousand for B&B, pathoma, and sketchy. 

>And even then if you use High Yield material to study for tests you may very well fail simply because professors go out of their way to test material that isn’t high yield or they will take a high yield concept and over complicate it to the nth degree just to keep the average low.

Question, what year are you? Because if you're a M1 or M2, you have no idea what's high yield. You only know what's on board review material. Which isn't all, ""high yield."" Correlation with Uworld, sure, but i doubt an M1 or M2 at this point in the calendar year is using uworld, which are the gold standard board style questions.

>just to keep the average low

If you're P/F, it doesn't matter. Relative ranking matters. In either case, I doubt any school wants to fail more than 1-3% of any given class. So it would be curved regardless. 

>It’s a common joke that DO schools are worse than MD schools but it’s true, but not because the students are dumb/bad/worse than MD students.

Yeah no, DO students are objectively worse test takers. MCAT, GPA, STEP, you name it. On average, DO students are poorer test takers. 

>It was confirmed to me by a faculty member that at the last major faculty meeting the board of trustees and the dean decided to lower the typical exam average from an 84 to an 80 just for the sole purpose that it would push a few people below the passing threshold.

I very much doubt this. Accrediting bodies watch grad rates closely. It spells trouble for schools when they fail a certain amount of students. That said, think through the logic. Supposedly, you're making a few extra K. Why not just boost a few rota sites with preceptor sites and add more slots instead? Additionally, there's an issue with your school's rank if you're seen as producing students who routinely fail their boards. It's self-defeating.

"> I criticized the social justice movement and you said that any such criticism compares to what you perceive to be institutional racism/sexism.

Indeed. That isn't ""whataboutism"", because it's not talking about something else, saying ""what about that"". Instead, I'm challenging your notion that the ""social justice movement"" is responsible for the rise of anti-feminism and white nationalism. I see it as the opposite: sexism and racism were there first, they gave rise to the social justice movement, which is now being attacked by people who don't seem to understand why it exists in the first place.

> Are you talking about a few nazis on Stormfront?

There are more than a few, and they have different names now, like the ""Alt-Right"" and ""White Nationalists.""

>Because most anti-feminists support equal rights

Sorry, I don't buy that, and unless you have actual data that supports your claim I'm going to have to call BS. Now, some of these anti-feminists may claim they are for equal rights, but they'll be just as quick to dismiss any actual examples of sexism.

>they just oppose what they perceive modern feminism as having become.

I am very well aware of what proponents of this point of view believe, I simply think they are wrong.

>Just as nazis have every right to say that black people and Jews are inferior.

Interesting how you compare people who fight oppression with those who defend it...

>That doesn't mean you shouldn't criticize them for their ideas or for their approach.

Sure, the problem is that most criticism of feminism or of minority rights advocates is boneheaded, and based in deep-rooted sexism/racism, while criticism of nazis is completely justified.

>but when you call for art you don't like to stop existing or you try to get all of your Twitter followers to mass contact the company to remove content you don't like, you are advocating against free expression

Not really. You are engaging is free expression yourself - and it's not about ""art you don't like"", it's about media that perpetrates racist/sexist stereotypes. In any case, pressuring twitter or Disney to remove a sandbox for someone spewing hateful view towards people based on their gender or ethnic origin is just fine.

>In other words, you want to force developers to adopt your political views. 

No, I don't. There are such a thing as minimum standards of quality and decency. They don't have to be very high

>Nobody should have to ""adopt"" any sort of standards when it comes to art.

Are we talking about art, or video games? Because the latter are not necessarily art - and I say this as a professional game developer.

But, yeah, there are some minimum standards that publishers abide by, and for good reason.

>Different people enjoy different art and entertainment, and that's fine. It's not some great societal issue, it's people having different tastes and different interests... it's diversity.

Sorry, but no. Publishers have a responsibility to the public, and to their shareholders. Putting out a game where you're a KKK guy lynching blacks would immediately make the publisher fair game for a boycott, and perhaps a lawsuit under hate speech laws (where appropriate).

>It's related to gender politics, because you're making it related to gender politics. 

Not at all. It's related to gender politics because it's about gender politics.

>If for instance, a study showed that women interrupt men at a higher rate than the reverse, I wouldn't go around telling women to stop ""femterrupting."" 

Why not? If we were living in a matriarcal society, where women had significant social, economical and political advantages over men, and you were a young man doing his best to advance in a women-dominated world, you'd be completely justified in using such an expression.

It seems you are desperately trying to ignore actual gender issues. Your arguments are coming dangerously close to those who claim sexism doesn't exist, and women have it just as easy as men in our society, if not easier. Sorry to say this, but that sounds a lot like privilege talking...

"1) I never said that the Tories weren't going to win re-election, I said that Quebec was trying to deny them a majority. A strong NDP opposition would have put a major curb on Harper's power grabs, and we counted on progressives in Ontario and BC to follow through on this. The majority was never a foregone conclusion, and was in fact almost a surprise when the results were announced - the Orange Crush was the biggest story of the leadup, and most people thought that it had enough momentum to deny the Tories a majority. We know now this was wrong.

All that is besides the point anyway. The issue is that Quebecers have shows their willingness to put aside soveriegntist politics to vote for a federal party who represents the greater good for Canada as well as Quebec. The Bloc is a party that represents only Quebec's sovereigntist interest at the Federal level - the fact that they got destroyed as utterly as they did shows that Quebec is willing to put those interests aside. That's the point I was making.

2) That may be true, but the vast majority of the political rhetoric I've seen from Quebeckers in recent months has been anti-PLQ as opposed to anti-Harper. Say what you want about Harper's policies - and I do agree that he's a reprehensible power-mongerer who is allergic to any kind of governmental transparency - but he does resonate with the Conservative base, and most of his policies are at least defensible from that perspective. I just don't happen to agree with them, which is fine. The plurality of Canadians do seem to agree with them, and the fact is that he won the election fair and square. The wrong answer to losing the election is to cry for independence. The right answer is to try to foster change at the Federal level. Quebec can absolutely be a political forerunner in Canada. Charest, on the other hand, has managed to completely disassociate himself from any segment of his voting base, and seems to take a sort of perverse glee in seeing how he can fuck us over next. His approval rating must almost be in the negatives by now, and it shows in the papers here.

3) I choose to ignore the CAQ until Legault steps up and announces his intentions one way or another. However, if they do form a party and merge with the ADQ, as you suggest, then my point is even more valid - the ""party""'s entire reason for existence is that to represent a willingness among Quebecers to discuss politics without being hampered by the sovereignty issue. That single message is the reason it's poised to sweep the next Provincial election - Quebecers are, on the whole, sick and tired of the independence question. This was illustrated by the Orange Crush at the Federal level, and Legault's hypothetical success proves it yet again."
"Assertion is not argumentation. 

For instance:

""Women carry and create children within their body and men do not.""

And without the support systems that men provide, women cannot do this. Women cannot survive pregnancy in a state of nature. They are just a slow moving mass of fat and protein incapable of finding enough calories to maintain the pregnancy.

That is an example of a fact, as opposed to your impressionistic assertions.

And by the way:

""Motherhood is unique, that is a biological fact of life.""

That is tradcon as shit. Where did you pick that one up, the Family Research Council site? Pedestalizing motherhood like that has been THE rhetorical basis for every retrograde, patriarchalist attempt to keep women restricted to the home. 

""If we lived in a terrible country where bodily autonomy wasn't respected yes""

As a matter of fact we do live in such a country - infant circumcision - but that is a different discussion.

""We don't and they don't and they know this from day 1. ""

So you have just correctly defined it as a socially conferred privilege.

""Men can't prevent parenthood without assault after conception.""

Nonsense. Deny a woman the shelter, food, water and protection that men provide and she will ""spontaneously"" abort - miscarry in the early weeks.

Like it or not, for humans pregnancy is a community endeavor. There's another fact for you. Or is it your position that a pregnant woman is just entitled to have her needs met because of her inherent female wonderfulness?

""Motherhood is unique,""

"> Congress can pass a law to tie wages to your MIT Index, similar to the Consumer Price Index, and we are done....... we could move wages up or down gradually, over time, to meet a balance against the MIT index based on where they lived .....

Statements like this re-inforce to me that the majority of people on reddit and basicay in general populus don't understand taxes and the tax code and wage laws 

What you just described could be argued as unconstitutional. But it's clearly impractical

First: national wages are set by congress only, state wages are set by the state. To be lowered or increased, the general assemblies of the state or congress have to enact a law changing the minimums. 

Wages are not part of congress budget, it's not something they can just change proportionately to something else. It has to be an actual act of congress or the states to change them 

The example you provided about consumer price index deals with matters of budgeting such as social security and other measures. 

You want to move wages up or down, each must require an act. 

Most importantly, any uneven wage rate would be challenged in courts and would lose.

">SPECIAL items are strictly OP.

Did you know that the term ""special item"" was invented by the BoI community? That term implies that ""special items"" are inherently good. Sure, they are pretty useful, yes, but the original set of special items were simply characterized by the fact that picking up one of them made the rest harder to find. That's all there is to it.

Check out all of the special items in the original. Raw Liver, Growth Hormones, Pentagram, Black Bean, Sister Maggy. These are ridiculous items that could not compare to Brimstone or Mom's Knife. They're nowhere near OP. To be completely honest I have no idea why they're special items.

The idea carries over to Rebirth, though. Special items are simply items that are coded to make it harder to obtain more than one at a time. It has nothing to do with how the items perform on their own. It's all a matter of how they perform when paired with other special items. I... don't exactly know why they were so concerned with making it hard for people to find Soy Milk as well as some of the other special items. Like, why make it hard for people to pick up Polyphemus and Soy Milk, aside from maybe benefiting people who pick up any other special item first. Some special items, when put together, are insanely overpowered, so they don't want to make the game to be so easy all the time. Then, I suppose, other special items just don't play well together, so they make it so that those items don't get paired together so often. 

So, once again, if an item is special, it's not because of what it does, but how it interacts with specific other items."

"It is absolutely normal for you, and for most introverted people. Personally, I don't care to force myself into aimless small talk at some bar just because humans are supposed to need as much social contact as possible. I have enough contact with my partner, family, coworkers, and the few close friends I choose to interact with. Extroverted people need social contact with as many people as possible because it helps them to learn who they are by bouncing themselves off strangers and seeing their reactions. Introverted people (in my mind) have a more confident sense of their identity and prefer to limit interactions to those who actually matter and care for them. My partner often says I am rude at parties etc because I don't put effort into small talk and often make people feel awkward. I just laugh it off. There's nothing wrong with you. Personally, I think it's crazy to feel a need to chatter with strangers you'll never see again and who don't give a fuck about you.

"I disagree that it's less beneficial. As I said before, it opens up more opportunities for whatever you want to do. The opponent has more tools to attack with, sure, but that means you have more to counter with. 

The time concern is valid, but the issue here is also that defense is generally not being trained intelligently. The level of striking talent and coaching in MMA is significantly lower than the level of grappling talent and coaching. There are a few exceptions, but overall guys are not getting solid instruction on defense from the beginning of their careers. There was an interview Firas Zahabi did for sherdog.com with Patrick Wyman where he explained that a lot of the pros who come to him, even high level ones, are missing fundamentals. It's much easier to be a coach who teachers great athletes how to be aggressive and dangerous than it is to build defense into everything the fighter does. 

As for how the defense works in their game, every style can benefit from improved defense instead of leaping out of range. You have to use the specific techniques that fit best into your game of course--a wrestler doesn't want to stand on the outside trying to check and pull back from kicks--but once you do that you enjoy all the advantages.

Your last point is extremely flawed logic. If you need better defense it only means that you need better defense. You can put two guys with shit defense and dangerous offense against each other, and in that example BOTH guys need better striking defense more than they need better offense. Take Roy Nelson for example. Nobody ever beat him by deciding their striking defense was good enough. That's why he knocks out everyone who has bad defense, and gets dominated by everyone with good defense.

Leaping back out of range is just bad striking. I understand why it happens so often, but we don't need to make excuses for the best fighters in the world. I believe in holding the sport to a higher standards, especially when you look at how fast fighters are improving across the board."
"You keep going back to slavery when I already said it wasn't relevant. Why don't you engage with one of the examples I actually cited. You see a black person chastise a white person for wearing dreadlocks.

Is the white person allowed to wear dreadlocks? Is he allowed to even make a case for why he should be allowed to wear dreadlocks? Or should we just defer to the black person because she is black?

Or let's say you're at Yale when an email from an admin goes around suggesting we should respect students' ability to select their own Halloween costumes, a suggestion that earns the admin calls to resign or be fired:

> Put another way, he believes that one respects students by engaging them in earnest dialogue. But many of the students believe that his responsibility is to hear their demands for an apology and to issue it. They see anything short of a confession of wrongdoing as unacceptable. In their view, one respects students by validating their subjective feelings.

You're cherry picking slavery because it's an easy win. Of course slavery is abhorrent. Who would argue otherwise? But what about all of these much less obvious cases, with much more shades of gray? If we defer to the oppressed, if we concede to their demands that we not debate the facts but instead listen to them talk about their pain, then we lose a lot of opportunity to build community and understanding."

"None of that makes you're viewpoint objectively true. It's only true if you accept all your axioms, one of which is, apparently, ""all violence is always wrong in every circumstance."" I reject that from the start, and as such nothing you say follows. Violence can be justified, at both and individual and societal level, in order to prevent further violence or other, worse harms. 

>Now, this is kindergarten level stuff, but trading something for something else is qualitatively different than threatening someone with violence if they don't give you what you want - literally: ""don't hit, use your words.""

I do agree that libertarian philosophy generally uses about a kindergarten-level of discourse in defining things like ""force"" and ""coercion"", so no disagreement there. In my opinion, the ability to threaten financial destitution, homelessness, starvation or death by disease is just as much a use of ""force"" as holding a gun to someone's head, which is the general relationship between employer and employee. In both cases ""give me money or I'll shoot you"" vs. ""work for x wage or go poor"", the exchange is free (both parties still technically have a choice), and mutually beneficial (the person with a gun/job opening gets money/labour and the other person doesn't get shot/starve), but in both cases the power imbalance is enormous and one person benefits far more. I consider both scenarios coercive, the only difference being one of degree. For further analogy, people usually view a superior requesting a n employee for sexual favours in return for a promotion to be coercive/unethical due to the power imbalance, and yet somehow if the thing being exchanged is labour instead it's all alright.


>If it is not wrong to use violence, then you are literally assenting to having violence used against you, meaning that were we having this disagreement in person, I could beat you into agreeing with me, and you would have no recourse but to simply agree and smile about it - it is a paradox precisely because might does not make right. 

Conversely, how do you protect property or even have the concept of property without either violence or the threat of violence? Property rights can only exist in a meaningful way if there is someone to enforce them. If you live in a stateless society, your right to property literally extends as far as you can personally protect it (i.e. might makes right). If you live in a normal society you have the government monopoly on legitimate force protecting your property for you - but to have that, you need to cede some small portion of that property to them in return for that protection (and a ton of other things). That's the agreement humans across the world in virtually every nation have made in order to have functional societies, which strikes me as justifying the ""violence"" the government employs through enforcing taxation.

>So yes, I am right. And yes, you are wrong. And besides that, moral relativism is yet another cowards retreat from engaging seriously with actual ideas.

Whereby ""moral relativism""= morals I disagree with. I don't accept your morals as correct, and neither do most people, but congratulations on finding an ideology where you're automatically right because anyone who disagrees with you is a 'coward', a 'moral relativist' and 'wrong'.

Again, in LaRouche v. Fowler, 152 F.3d 974 (D.C. Cir. 1998), the court ruled that the DNC could enforce a DNC delegate selection rule depriving a presidential candidate of any delegates based on a determination that he was not a bona fide Democrat, even though the candidate had won enough votes in the primaries to be allocated delegates. The court concluded that even if the DNC were to be treated as a state actor, the DNC would not be subject to the “compelling state interest” test because of “the presence of First Amendment interests on both sides of the equation.” 152 F. 3d at 995.

The court held that the Constitution would be “’satisfied if [the party’s rules] rationally advance some legitimate interest of the party in winning elections or otherwise achieving its political goals.’” Id. at 995, quoting Ripon Society, supra, 525 F.21d at 586-87."

"Are you sure that's a good way to learn machine learning? The ability to follow the steps of different algorithms is very different from understanding why the algorithm works or how one would come up with it. For example, many learning algorithms are either a scheme for optimizing some loss-function (e.g. EM-algorithms) or an implementation of a heuristic (e.g. k-nearest neighbors is really just a smoothness assumption) - in neither case will understanding the steps of the algorithm give you insight into why the algorithm works, i.e. by what principle does it generalize. 

Algorithms are not the central concept in machine learning, models are. You can always look up how some algorithm works, but the ability to model the data-generating process, whatever the context may be, is what separates value-generating data-scientists from the I-can-modify-a-Keras-tutorial data-scientists (which is not to say that modifying Keras tutorials isn't a fine exercise, but you know, it's not the pinnacle of machine learning proficiency)."

I also don't think Star Wars is the right home for some Dark Knight ""we're-adults-so-show-us-a-lot-of-violence"" type movie.

The story could however have potential for a more toned down mature look into the difficulty of watching over Luke, who he obviously would care about, without being able to actively partake in his life. There would also be the underlying tension of always being afraid that the empire would discover either Kenobi or Luke. This would of course have to be heavily actor-driven, as they couln't hide behind special efects, and would probably have a far narrower appeal than some action-explosion-fest thay could throw out.

Just because a town has success doesn't mean this is the most efficient method for other places. Other towns have a different flux of traffic.

 Different # of users for the road
 Different purposes for each road (high speed)
 Residential
 Business (Cars might want to stop in more places - without organized parking, this could get out of hand in a high traffic area)
 Water (Efficient drainage system design might call for a certain design)

So reasons like these are why they were invented. Just because they were invented DOES NOT mean they were the best for everything."

IGF had to clear that up and it seems she is the one who stepped away from judging. (from the tweet they sent afterward..) They had no choice, her actions were putting at risk their credibility. Why is it so hard to understand that. It wasn't GG who made her tweet 'crappy jokes', it wasn't GG who made Biddle tweet about 'bringing back bullying', it was their own stupidity.

I'm surprised they don't see the whole picture and insist how obvious that joke was. Let's be honest, if a male judge would have said the same thing about women they wouldn't have understood the joke either.. it's only funny when they do it. Not the other way around.

If tomorrow a gaming website tweet that they will put lower score on any review of women only games I would love to see how funny they find it.

">It wasn't apropos of nothing.... if a freaking Trump supporter is going to

You either inferred that support from a username, or recalled previous interaction with the user, because there was no discussion of Trump going on in the current context. By the rules I am explicitly expecting you to apply, that means it was not relevant to the conversation.

As you can see for yourself by checking the registry of bans linked in the sidebar, we used to have an extremely disruptive user here called ""MarxBro"", who after being permanently banned engaged in serial ban evasion, typically with usernames that were either obvious dupes or had some other reference to communism. It was not appropriate, at any time, to tell that user ""okay but you're a communist, who cares about your argument"" - I was amused when Sargon of Akkad did that (to someone who was almost certainly not MarxBro!) IRL, but I would discipline him for doing it in this subreddit.

>and hey, look, zero mod response for the latter, which is totally not waging culture war at all right you guys

I find it strange how readily people can find examples like this, in this case from two weeks ago and heavily downvoted. Like I said, we are generally lenient with this sort of thing, because it turns out that it's actually pretty hard to attempt that sort of analysis without betraying one's own bias. But doing it prompted by the presence of another person in the discussion, or by the fact of that person's username is clearly worse in terms of civility.

> so when I go ahead and assume that sexism is bad, that's too much culture war.

No, that is not why you were told something was waging culture war, which in turn is not the same thing as ""too much"" culture war.

>maybe Saudi Arabia has it right in removing women from the public sphere entirely, that isn't?

I doubt that anyone actually argued that in more than a devil's advocacy way; I certainly don't recall having noticed it recently. But regardless, the moderation policy is not about what political positions you are allowed to hold or advocate for. It is about how you are allowed to interact with other users and what you are allowed to say about people who disagree with you. It is considered especially bad to attribute politically-convenient-for-you motives to your outgroup that are not explicitly claimed by your outgroup.

>What, are we going to ban posts

We don't normally remove posts; we prefer to ban users and leave the comments up as ""heads on stakes"" examples.

>except insofar as presuming just about any basic moral judgment does

""People who voted for a POTUS who represents a major political party should get insulted on sight"" is not a ""basic moral judgment"".

>are we going to ban posts that assume the statement ""killing innocent people is bad"" because that's dismissing the views of military dictators?

That is not remotely comparable, and you reasonably ought to understand that.

We welcome ""the total democide attributable to the NSDAP is approximately 21 million, per the source Wikipedia cites"". We generally tolerate ""groups X and Y are arguing about whether it's acceptable to punch Nazis"" (although we discourage ""here's a link to group Y's summary of group X's policies re Nazism and why group X is terrible for thinking that way"" without additional context; that's the ""boo outgroup"" report reason). We explicitly solicit social commentary on what the category ""Nazi"" means in the current day, and the social consequences of combining a given definition with a given level of tolerance for physical violence. It is perfectly okay to say ""mass killings are bad, genocide is especially bad and the NSDAP were bad for perpetrating it"" - although you might get pushback on the identification of exactly who was responsible (e.g. ordinary citizens vs. the SS etc.) and how blame should be apportioned, because that is also okay here.

We don't tolerate ""User Z is a Nazi"". (If you think you have a case to report User Z to the Reddit admins based on the global Reddit rules, we cannot stop you, and would not want to stop you.)

>How exactly do you think you can maintain the project of not engaging with political debate when basic morality and facts are not agreed upon?

The project is not ""not engaging with political debate"". It is more like ""maintaining civility and emotional distance while discussing contentious topics that can be freely debated almost nowhere else, and coming to a clearer understanding of why people believe what they believe and how people can come to such radically different conclusions on the same observations"".

Most places that allow views outside the Overton window are only capable of allowing one at a time, and collapse into circlejerks around that view. Here, we've taken on what I deem an extraordinarily difficult project, that can only possibly succeed because of the high intelligence of the user base.

But ""disagreeing on the facts"" has nothing to do with the current discussion, AFAICT. You were initially objected to for referring to ""shitty social views""; please try saying the phrase ""objectively shitty"" out loud to yourself with a straight face.

>Trump is a lot of things, but charitable is not fucking one of them.

I pulled this part out to the end, because it relates to that last question as well.

Whether or not a public figure is ""charitable"" is not a question of fact, and certainly not one you can prove with a link to a twitter feed. Yes, moderating this subreddit involves subjective judgment. That's why we ordinarily err on the side of leniency. But I am explicitly telling you now that the way you appear to expect things to work is fundamentally at odds with the way they actually work here.

More generally, categorizations are not questions of fact. If it confuses you that I would assert this, I strongly encourage you to read the Sequences, particularly the bits that ended up as part N of ""from AI to Zombies"" (part 1 of 28 here).

The problem is not assuming ""sexism is bad""; it's making arguments of the form ""X is bad because X is sexism according to how I personally understand the word 'sexism'"". Keep in mind here that [MLK Jr. was a criminal (and so are illegal immigrants), abortion and capital punishment are both murder, genetic engineering to cure disease is eugenics, evolutionary psychology is sexist, affirmative action is racist, and taxation is theft]( http  - all ""by definition"", according to various different people who are saying these things in 100% sincerity and good faith, because it accords with how they understand those terms. There is not an objective external voice that can tell them otherwise - dictionaries are descriptive rather than prescriptive, and they describe in terms of other words. Language is simply incapable of cleaving concept-space at the joints because there are no joints. Or to put it pithily: if race is a social construct, then racism necessarily must be also."

However, I can't help but think how silly these performative displays of 'wokeness' are b/c its impossible to separate them from the fact that the whole thing is the result of some very effective direct/indirect/social marketing companies. And I also wonder how silly these displays will seem 10 years from now when the cultural zeitgeist has morphed into something else.

Stuff gets deprecated all the time as tech moves on. Hacking up a poor user experience has worked up till now. It won't into the future. 

Change is constant. Mods only peripherally control the platform, because they benefit from the massive userbase of the platform. Do you think a flairless /r/NFL would be unpopular? I don't. 

 And I expect the admins have plenty of analytics available to them to tell them what is popular and not - and I expect they will deploy features based on that data.

The admin's job is to navigate the entire platform into the future. It is fraught with risk, to be sure - I just don't think things like custom flairs are actually as important as other issues.

Here is what I think the hooolaboolo is all about. Moderators can see that the platform will be more standardised and don't want to give up control. They don't really care about the features, they care about the control. 

Guess what? I don't care who controls the widgets - I want the site to stop crashing and have features that work on a variety of devices, not just desktop browsers.

"Now you have finally said something that isn't insulting. It took you 4 posts in a row. Congrats. Try starting with just that: they have privilege. Leave out all that other crap.

Let me give you a few ""don'ts"" to boot. Don't tell them why they are offended. You know what that sounds like? ""This woman is just offended because she has a uterus, which is interfering with her thought processes."" Is that just a bit sexist? Maybe offensive? That's what you sounded like. Also remember that many will have heard of privilege before, and been pissed off at what that other person said. They are starting off offended, not at the implication of privilege, but because people who talk about privilege tend to insult them.

Don't tell them that it is OK for minorities to be racist to them because they have privilege. Nobody wants to be treated like shit, and when you say that you are saying they deserve to be treated like shit. Nobody deserves to be treated like shit just because of their race or sex. That is racism 101, and you fail it when you say shit like that.

Don't tell them that they are an asshole for not acknowledging privilege the very first time they hear of it. Nothing shuts down a conversation faster than just insulting the other person, because now it is just tossing insults at each other. Think of this: ""You don't know what hibberdejeebus is? Not knowing about it means you are a douchebag."" Do you immediately jump on the hibberdejeebus bandwagon, or think this guy is being a dick to you?

Don't tell them that their life is easy. You have no idea what their life is like. Sure, as a fellow white dude you may think ""Of course I have privilege! Look at my life! I can just imagine how bad a woman would have it in my shoes!"" Their life may be a living hell. They may have been abused, raped, homeless, whatever. And you are saying ""Oh, that? That was nothing."" Go tell an amputee that they are living the good life, because they are a white male. See if they think you are an asshole. Because, well... you kind of are when you do that.

Don't insist that they are the only ones with privilege in the world. You aren't in their shoes. They see countless examples of where ""nonprivileged"" people have advantages that they don't have. They will bring them up as examples of the privilege of those people. Saying ""Oh, no, that doesn't count, only you have privilege"" sets them apart as the special people who are oppressing everybody else. Telling somebody that they are an evil oppressor is probably going to piss them off a little when they try to be a good person. It also confuses what privilege is when you can't admit that everybody has some. 

From the sound of it, you may be bouncing off your own privilege. You couldn't even see how offensive you were being. If you can't see these things, how can you blame them when they can't see your things? Especially when you are insulting them while you are at it?"

You are in an extreme minority in saying Inferno is easy. I'm not sure why real life comparisons are being drawn either. What do my personal hardships have anything to do with in game difficulty?

Since you drew the comparison between D3 length and other games (I am excluding MMO's because they aren't beatable, and including single player games because that's what Diablo is at its core) then let's have a look at the amount of time it takes to beat a game on the highest difficulty/~100% completion:

If they beat Inferno in under 80 hours, I would be impressed. I would tell you that yes, Inferno is clearly a piece of cake and I am just retarded for still being Act 3, or that your friends are among the gaming gods.

120 hours is by no means even close to ""fast"" for this game.

Also, speaking for everyone when it comes to a game's difficulty because your friends beat the game in a less than average span of time is just plain stupid.

Stop being wrong about everything you say please. Thank you.

"No. I believe in right and wrong. Your cartoonish idea that some people in their right mind act like villains out of comic books has nothing to do with morality. 

I don't have anything against the term evil, except how you use it. Like they are a normal person until they are possessed by demons or are just otherwise magically evil, with no factors to consider. 

> People get off and are satiated by seeing others suffer
 Do you consider this to.be evil or the actions of someome that is mentally ill?

Both. 

How could getting off on violence not be a mental illness? I am not talking like 50 shades stuff, I am talking people whose compulsions are so strong that they consider hurting or killing victims.

If it takes murdering somebody to arouse somebody, how could you describe that as sane?

> The problem with me

Good way to phrase it. It is the problem with you. Having a mental illness does not remove agency. You can still make choices while suffering from a mental illness, and murder counts. 

Lots of people with terrifying mental illnesses have not murdered dozens and injured 500. If every mentally ill person did this, we would know.

Why should your incorrect views stop scientific progress?"
"We have no idea what kind of medication it was though, it could have been an antipsychotic or blood pressure medicine or something similar that requires regular monitoring to watch for side effects and efficiency. The doctor would be liable for any complications she experienced if something with her medication went wrong and he/she hadn't performed regular check-ups. She's not a doctor and not informed enough to make a choice regarding prescription drugs.

The fact that she is overweight puts her at a higher risk for experiencing side effects for a lot of medications, not that she likely gives a shit. "
"Again, you can do what you want with your life, but being okay with the phrase ""the majority of us would rather see you back in the metaphorical kitchen"" is embarrassing, point blank. Sorry.

Nothing inherently embarrassing about being in the kitchen, just about accepting and promoting that role because it's the only one these anime nazis will allow. No one should get to tell you where they ""want you to be"" in that facet.

Being ""the woman"" in a relationship also doesn't have to mean staying in the home all day. There are women in relationships who aren't in the home all day, so that generalization is categorically false. A more accurate term for the role you want to play is called being ""the housewife,"" which again is not necessarily bad per se, but not synonymous.

Being the woman in a relationship means just that: existing as a person of the female gender who is also in a given relationship. Same with being a man. Beyond that, neither demographic is bound to a lifetime set of responsibilities except for a few select things that stem from biological differences, such as women's unique ability to breastfeed and have babies, both of which are already being and eventually will be rendered moot with future technology anyhow."
"> If I abandon my principles than there is no incentive for politicians to ever care about my principles outside of being not QUITE as terrible as their opposition.

That only applies to this specific question if we hold that voting third party in a presidential election is the only way to demonstrate your principles. It's actually just the easiest and quickest way.

If holding your nose and voting for someone imperfect in the presidential election equates to abandoning your principles, then you were never seriously involved in politics in the first place. There are many avenues for political change that people engage in every day. Serious activists who can do their work and then make a slight compromise in the presidential election that is not tantamount to abandoning all of their principles and ceding any effect on the political process.

So really, a claim like that only reveals that you are not involved beyond a vote every four years.

> if every person had the balls to stick to their principles instead of holding their nose every election and voting for the least shitty candidate how different do you think the world would be?

"> Revolution and organizing are not the same, so which is it?

Lol, you have no idea what's meant by revolution. A revolutionary act is anything that forcibly shuts down the system. A strike is revolutionary. An occupation is revolutionary. Organizing leads to striking.

> Why didn't Denmark need a violent revolution to get to its current state?

Because the US, in its desire to prevent the spread of communism, subsidized a social democracy on the borders of the Soviet Union to prevent the working class from wanting communism. (Read up on the Marshall Plan.) And now that the USSR is gone, the Scandinavian countries are rapidly privatizing.

> It got there by gradual and peaceful change towards a socialist state, rather than an immediate one.

And now I'm just blown away. You think Marx wrote about a society like Denmark?

> That's why I'm still a socialist.

No, you're a liberal.

> Reform is barely happening, sure, but revolution is not happening at all. 

Reform is happening because people organize, not because they elect the right liberal buttplug. The Fight for 15 is winning, even against politicians who have resisted it. You don't win these reforms by electing people. And moreover, reforms have never led to socialism. Never.

Of course, revolution could happen if you liberals just accepted that bourgeois democracy doesn't represent you. There's data to prove that policy is determined by the wealthy, even when liberals have control of the White House and both houses of Congress.

> As long as you can speak freely, populism that can't win through the dissemination of ideas isn't going to suddenly become more popular when you start shooting people, and oppression isn't going to be defeated by using violence to oppress anybody who does not acquiesce to your demands.

> If you're just going to use a bunch of fallacious arguments I don't see the point in the discussion. Oversimplifying things is just lazy.

"Depends on whether you want regular coffee or espresso based drinks. For espresso the barrier to entry for decent machines is much higher, while tools for regular coffee can be bought dirt cheap (if you don't need automation and want higher quality).

">“Now women are more likely to get married to a less-educated man.”

Anecdotally I've witnessed this a ton, especially people I know from smaller towns where the women's childhood ambitions were like veterinarian (or in the case of one friend, nuclear reactor technician in the Navy) and the guy's ambitions were like... ""fuck college, I can join the army/work for my dad's business/take a four week training course in xyz and make $26k a year."" Don't get me wrong, money isn't everything, but these are people who fell into things because they were easy or their only option because they had cultivated zero skills and disdain ""liberal"" education. 

All my friends from high school with few exceptions have bachelors or masters and married guys with no degree who are unquestionably less intelligent than them in virtually every way and emotionally stunted ""guy's guy"" types. Because small town 'Merica loves it some gender roles. It's actually soul crushing to watch someone who was in the top ten of their class and had a 4.0 in college marry some fucking loser at 23 and pump out a bunch of kids, then get left at 30 by that chud after she sacrificed everything to make him happy... Then there's my former boss, a gorgeous mid 40s lady in super good shape who is a total sweetheart and very successful at her career, who is dating some total white trash loser who will never hold down a job and calls her at work (her office is still near me and I hear them fighting) whining about xyz every ten minutes. It's fucking maddening how many relationships re some shade of this, not necessarily in terms of money but in terms of emotional labor. 


Also, anecdotally, speaking of ""marrying up"" what's with like 75% of men being with a girl who is cuter than them while only about 20% are with equal attractiveness and maybe 5% are with women less attractive than them? My boyfriend and I make a game out of this in public places, trying to find a couple where the guy is actually hotter than the woman because it's almost not a thing. Our society pushes women to settle so fucking hard while also telling them their appearance matters more than anything, so you end up with all these guys (many of who could be decent looking if they put literally any effort into personal hygiene or appearance) who have also been taught they don't really need to cultivate a decent personality or skills because just existing means they're owed a partner. That's why the RedPill/Incel, etc nonsense about women only ""want a hot Chad with muscles and money and xyz"" is such a fucking bullshit scam. Outside of some really large, competitive cities, like 2% of the male population looks like/earns like that because most men are not taught to put any effort into their appearance and very few humans in general are super successful financially. Yet the majority of the straight population between 18-80 is coupled, and it's not 1000 girls hitched to one Chad so FUCKING CLEARLY plenty of women are willing to ""settle"" (har har) for a guy who is not super hot, fit or successful. 

I recently decided I'm going to start yelling ""she's too hot for you bro and I can please her better than you"" at middle aged men (EDIT: I'M CLEARLY FUCKING KIDDING) I see with a wife who is still working so hard to look good and he's completely let himself go. Because I'm fucking angry for that woman that she feels pressured to put all this effort in (not that looking good for yourself isn't a cool thing) while he feels zero push to do so and yet he probably is still eyehumping 20 year old waitresses. 

Man I'm bitter about the state of ""traditional"" marriage/straight relationships. Everything is stacked against women from day one but then somehow we're still the assholes. If we're hot, we're a stuck up bitch. If we're not hot, we're shit. If we're successful, we're ""career women who don't know how to treat a man or make a good home."" If we don't work, we're golddiggers. If we're working, we're still doing (statistically) over 80% of housework and child-rearing but if we don't want to ""do it all"" we're failures at womanhood. If we have any standards at all in a mate we're shallow yet we're expected to see the ""good"" in men's personalities (even when there's very little of it) because we're taught the worst thing ever is to end up alone at 30. Virtually every type of media about marriage or romance is sexist and favors men, whether it's the chunky dork who ends up with a hot woman who is out of his league in every way at the end of the rom-com, the manchild husband with the hot wife who has to baby/cajole/bitch him out to get him to just marginally function as an adult, the Christian Grey/shiny guy from Twilight ""romantic"" archetype who's really a controlling psycho, etc. We're never shown as women that relationships are about a partnership of equals. Ever.

"Go look up all the other movies that were moved to an early-Feb release date - instead of just cherry-picking the best ones! 

You will see that the average film this happens to is god-awful. The fact that Kingsman is the best you can come up with implies that I am right. 

For instance, let's just look at the films that were moved this year. I can remember three of them. Rings was moved to February - and it has a 6% rating on RT. Power Rangers was moved to January and then March, and it was terrible. 

And, the movie that completely destroys your argument - The Space Between us was moved to this exact weekend. It was scheduled for an awards release - and got pushed to Super Bowl weekend. And, it's got a 17% rating on RT.

I'm not trying to insinuate that socialism or communism are awesome. They're not. They're a fantasy. As long as humans have ANY greed, they'll never work. AKA they'll NEVER work.

That being said, there are a LOT of REALLY ignorant morons in this thread conflating terms and ideas that have literally nothing to do with each other because of silly biases and effective media brainwashing.

EDIT: Let me provide some examples so that people who are struggling with various concepts can get a better idea of what's going on:

Capitalism:

A man owns 400 acres of good farmland. He hires 19 people to work said land with him. He pays those 19 people a wage and keeps 100% of the production of his farm. He sells the production of his farm, some of which the workers buy with the wages the farmer pays them. The farmer makes all the decisions about what sort of things to plant or when to rotate fields or where/to whom the production is sold, etc. The workers have literally no say in any decisions made on the farm. The farmer primarily makes decisions about the farm based on his needs, without concern for his workers or people unrelated to his farm.

Socialism:

There are 400 acres of good farmland. 20 people work this land. All 20 people equally own this land. All 20 people equally divide all production from this land among themselves. They keep any excess production or trade it for other goods that all 20 people need. All decisions are made by the 20 people who work the farm. The people working on the farm generally make decisions to benefit their community, which includes themselves, but also benefits other people nearby, whom they probably trade excess farm production for other goods and services with.

Communism:

There are 400 acres of good farmland. The government owns all of it (and, in fact, the government owns 100% of all land in the country), but is only allowed to use it for the good of the citizens of the country. 20 people work on that farmland, at the government's direction. The government collects 100% of all production from the farm. That production plus all the other production of all other farms in the country is divided among all the people of the country so that everyone in the entire country, farmer or not, has an equal amount of all the farms production. All goods from all industries are handled this way. All decisions about farms (including this one) or any other industry are made by the government with the intention of maximizing the benefit provided to all citizens, farmer or not.

So there you go. Three little examples to help people understand the differences. These can obviously be scaled in either direction. The capitalist farm can only employ the farmer and his family, and the socialist farm could be worked by hundreds of people. Scale is irrelevant.

You'll also notice that none of these examples has anything to say about things like free education, healthcare, taxes, UBI, or any other social welfare/safety net policy/law. That's cause those sorts of things (which are often mislabeled as ""socialist"") have absolutely nothing to do with socialism (or communism or capitalism) at all, even a little, and may occur in any/all/none of the three societies mentioned in the examples."

No offense but I have never heard a parent state anyting along those lines thus why I assumed you had no children, my mistake. My own personal experience has been that a child cries for a reason, you may not understand it but there is always reasoning behind it.

"Again, that's a false equivalencie. The same media is being consumed whether at home or on a large screen, it's not nearly the same as changing the art that is being consumed. However, the quality of the screens still has an impact on enjoyment as does the sound system. So, for most people watching the theoretical movie would be better in theatres since they don't have the equipment which can match the quality of watching it in the theatre (excluding other personal preferences like watching it alone etc)

"Before any more can reasonably be discussed I feel the need to ask, have you ever been to a communist nation? Your post reads like a copy/paste from a communist government. (I'm not saying it is, I know it isn't) 

>Capitalism does not remunerate all labour, but communism does.

It doesn't. It cannot and never will. No one in communist nations really gets paid at all. You can say ""remunerate"" a million times but really we are talking about the value of labor whether corporate or not. You seem to think that communist nations pay people just to have babies. The reality is that communist nations (sometimes) punish people for having babies to the point that children are literally thrown away and hidden. In communist nations people work hard, long hours with no breaks and basically no pay at all.

The reality is that if we could attain true communism then it could be good for people, all people. But only children believe in fairy tales. Even democracy, if it were true democracy would basically be an extreme form of socialism because of course society would vote for things which are better for themselves. You sound like maybe you have, or are getting/studying for a degree in economics so I cannot argue much there. I only know about the money I have.

People up vote and down vote all the time and commenting is not necessary. In fact, I would argue that a down voted comments would not actually be worthy of further comments. 

I don't intend to sit and argue all night or morning. So, suffice it to say that when you finish school and actually get out in the world and do something I think you might change your mind a little. I do not think capitalism is so grand, but I know that communism is a total and complete failure through historical fact, empirical observation, and personal experience.

This naked power grab backfired and returned a Harper majority. Ignatieff immediately moved back to the US, where he remains to this day. And that's what happens with all minority governments: constant elections and politicking, very little actual governing. Majority governments take that threat off the table and let a party pass legislation without constantly having to defend its existence. They, moreover, clearly delineate responsibility for legislative outcomes-- good or bad.

What's ""outside of feminism"" mean in this context?

>And I don't get why people who don't want to learn are exactly being brought up here.

Because most of the criticisms of feminism I see are founded on a misunderstanding of feminism. 

>Honestly, it seems like a lot of feminists aren't willing to learn about other's views and then expect others to know more than the basic media representation of feminism without teaching them.

Its not my job to teach you- you need to teach yourself. Read a book. Take a class. Read some articles. Pull up a glossary of terms and learn what they mean. You're demanding that people educate you, and that's a pretty unreasonable demand when all of the resources you need to educate yourself exist. Feminism doesn't need to re-brand itself just because people aren't willing to do the research. "
"The helicopter parenting your thinking of is more ‘strict’ authoritarian parenting. Yes, that causes more rebellion and drug use and pre marital sex etc. The helicopter parenting I am thinking of is more overbearing, handholding, and overprotective, not authoritarian. They can be, but they are quite different from the more authority based old school parents from the previous generation. 

Also the environment you grow up in is dramatically warped by these things. Schools, law enforcement, businesses etc have all become more oppressive towards youth. Schools have a zero tolerance policy towards a ton of ‘normal’ youth behavior now. Police in many areas now have laws where they’re required to stop kids in groups larger than 2. Many, many malls now ban kids for many hours of the day so they can’t hang out there. Public areas in my cousins town (parks, plazas etc) are required to remove any group of youth numbering 4 or more.

">Would you (or any other leftist) be willing to start a discussion about other leftist topics but avoiding trigger-words, and see how discussion proceeds? As someone said, status anxiety can be a useful topic, but calling it white fragility is just going to piss off everyone that doesn't already agree. Maybe about economic theories. Or elucidate the goals of different policies, and why what many around here consider flaws in proposals aren't flaws?

I did not use any trigger words like ""white fragility,"" neither in the post you're referring to nor in any other comment I ever made on this subreddit, ever. I've never once uttered the phrase in my life. Do you know why? Because I'm not actually that far left. I view myself as somewhat centrist on idpol topics. The sub is just far right - so far to the right that from your point of view, I am indistinguishable from a blue-haired SJW. My point was only that the sub cares a lot about racism against whites and not at all about racism against anyone else - indeed, using the term ""racist"" gets you downvoted here unless you're talking about anti-white racism.

Anyway. Last time I talked about the rightwing bias on the subreddit, the example I used was the Trump/Russia investigation. Around 5 users jumped up to explain to me that it's totally not rightwing to say the Russia investigation is a hoax. It was pretty hilarious.

>Thus far, you have continued that very troll-like refusing to define a term

If the term you are referring to is ethnostate, then the above statement is untrue. I have offered the definition of ethnostate I am going by. Here it is again:

>Because my understanding is that it is a""nation"" is defined in terms of ethnicity.

As for this:

>if the movement considers a monocultural nationalist supremacist nation state their goal, and their goal is to create an ""ethnostate,"" doesn't it stand to reason that this is exactly what an ""ethnostate"" is?

>The ""ethnostate"" that article described is most succinctly summarized by said quote

Well, that's ONE definition of an ethnostate. But you will recall that I cited two sources. In the second source, the core of an ethnostate is a nation:

>...defined by a shared heritage, which usually includes a common language, a common faith, and a common ethnic ancestry.

Sound familiar? (The implication, of course, being that it sounds a lot like Israel)

Furthermore, in that same article (the one you quote-mined), the author opines that the idea of an ethnostate is to smash all current nations and redivide the world into separate nation states based on race or religion. Again, sound familiar? ""Separate nation states based on race OR religion""! Opposition to a one-state solution on the grounds that Israel MUST remain a Jewish state?

>If you're genuinely interested in refuting my definitions, then provide your own and show why it is superior.

Why would I need to do that (show that my definition is superior)? I never claimed it was. You claimed your definition was the accepted definition and I asked you to prove that it was. Plus, I already explained that, even by YOUR definition, Israel is an ethnostate.

So we agree it's an imperfect solution. Would you also agree it is substantially more imperfect than MMP?

"I do not let myself suffer through these groups anymore. However, if the player is legitimately listening to my advice I will suffer through it.

Last night I was doing Gubal with friends, get in party with a BRD who is not using Minuet or any DOTs. One friend (WHM at the time) is a BRD player, I do not play BRD (or MNK) at all at 60 so I dunno what to tell the BRD. We basically explained she's doing everything wrong. She didn't improve much and the run took 40 something minutes but she acknowledged that she was doing it wrong and listened a bit. I won't freak out over someone who was just told they were playing their class wrong for (she was 59, but) almost or actually 60 levels. 

However, I had another experience with a BRD in Gubal that made me quit.

Get into Gubal, say hello. Two Roe guys and a Hyur tank. I was a DRG DPS leveling through it.I didn't really notice just how slowly we were going through things, but I looked at the timer just before the 2nd boss and 48 minutes had already passed. (This was before I was a bit more perceptive about my party buddies...) and I look at the BRD. No straight shot, no Minuet, no dots, nothing.
AST is not DPSing either. 

So I chime in, 'Hey Bard, you should use Minuet! It will help your DPS! :)' 

That was a mistake. The AST and Bard immediately keyboard warrior it up on me that I can't tell him how to play and the Bard doesn't like Minuet so he won't use it and no one should tell him to. Then the Tank chimes in too. I get the feeling they're all buddies. I kinda wish I parsed but, 48 minutes and we were not at the 2nd boss? I was a bit undergeared as DRG because it was my 2nd time leveling Dragoon on an alt but I can't carry that in Gubal. BRD should've been doing AoE but I don't think he did at all.

"> Well it's not a lie. It's true. When the markets crashed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, that money did go from the working class to the wealthy.

Oh god, you believe that crap.

Yeah, no, that's not what happened at all. I'm afraid you've been lied to by horrible people who were manipulating you.

Here's the thing: most value is imaginary. It doesn't actually exist.

When the mortgage crisis happened, what happened was that houses lost value. The thing is, the value didn't go anywhere; it never existed in the first place. The houses were said to be worth $500k, and then were worth, say, $250k. That extra $250k did not go from the working class to the wealthy; it simply ceased to exist at all, because it had never actually existed in the first place.

This is why banks and financial institutions lost large amounts of money, and why Lehman Brothers went bankrupt - when people defaulted on their mortgages, the houses went back to the banks. But the banks were left with a bunch of houses that they had spent more money on than they were now worth.

If I say my house is worth $1 million tomorrow, and then in a week it is worth $500k, my net worth has declined by $500k, but I didn't actually lose any physical money.

That's what happened. And it is a big problem if a lot of your assets are in houses, because if your houses are worth less, then your total assets are worth less, and thus your net worth is less, which means you may not be able to sell them to pay off your debts.

You are operating under the mistaken belief that the economy is a zero sum game. It is not; the total size of the economy is not fixed.

> Their value has significantly outpaced their income...

Actually, it hasn't. Anyone who tells you otherwise is, I'm afraid, lying to you. Productivity and total compensation have grown together.

It should also be noted that people on the top have seen larger productivity increases than people on the bottom in terms of value added vs paid.

Indeed, the companies that pay the least - people like WalMart - actually have the lowest profit margins. Walmart only makes 2-3% profits. Conversely, companies like Google, which pay their employees six digit salaries, make 20+% profits."

a. Think that there should never be a CoC under any circumstances?

"This is just plain wrong-headed thinking. The food scene in the US blew up around 2007. Not just in Austin, but in every single major city in the country (and some not-so-major cities). There was the small-plate revolution, with brussel sprouts, sweetbreads, shishito peppers, burrata, tartares, confits, and the like. And this happened all over the country. New food with a new way to eat it.

We're ten years after the revolution, and these restaurants are still trotting out the same tired small plates. They're no longer worth those prices. Those recipes have worked their way into suburban cookbooks and dinner parties. Who wants to pay fine-dining prices for now-pedestrian food?

I went to Odd Duck this weekend and was bored by two of the three dishes that I ordered (and the bad service made them even worse). I ordered the pork belly because I wanted to see how a solid establishment like Odd Duck innovates on a tired dish. The answer is that they didn't.

With the exception of a handful of innovative restaurants, the only places I'm enjoying now are either crazy-expensive (Otoko), or are finding ways to offer reasonably priced quality food.

So yeah, get out of Austin and you'll see how boring we are. Our food scene is stuck in 2007. While I could name a dozen restaurants that are still doing innovative, clever, and downright tasty food for a good price, I can even more easily name 40 spots that are trying to stay alive with tired, overpriced food.

> calling me a house Jew

You are trying to connect the term House Negro, which is a pejorative term for a black person, used to compare someone to a house slave of a slave owner from the historic period of legal slavery in the United States, in the context of Jews. Jews were enslaved by Egyptians and 72 years ago were enslaved by the Nazi's. A House Jew would be Capos in the modern context. Jews who helped most probably by force the Nazi regime. Arab traders pioneered the pre-american slave trade and you think you are on the right side. You are technically helping the cause of Arabs who invented the slave trade that America later adopted. Arabs have never renounced slavery. They can't, the Koran states that its okay, just like rape. Mauritania still has Arabs enslaving over 10% of its Black people.

> If Israel gave the same rights and protections to the Palestinians that the Americans gave to their native population

There is a problem though. Palestinians dont want to live under Israel's umbrella therefore they dont want the rights and protections that Israel provides. You seem to think that Palestinians are a viable peace partner but you are sorely mistaken. 

> I actually really like Israel

You like Israel and may not be Jewish but even if you aren't religious you know the stories of Jews in Israel. Those stories are in Judea and Samaria. Those stories were at the Temple Mount. Jews dont want to be in submission to the rules of Islam by non-Muslims before one is actually living under a Muslim ruler like you think they should. What would happen if Judea, Samaria and the Temple Mount were given up? The Jews would be expelled as the PA has stated. You are supporting forced expulsion. You hate Israel.

> Im concerned with its soul

You are concerned with how Muslims view Israel when they already have OVER 99% of the Middle East. Now, Europe has already been a victim of Palestinianisation and will soon be Arab too. You are being a weak Dhimmi Jew.

> Right not Palestine

Palestine is not a country. The Torah has Judea and Samaria which is Israel according to it.

I am just stating what is going on with Israel's neighbors.

That is putting the cart before the horse.

The problem with that attitude is that it is short sighted.

It leads to freemium games that have zero respect for the gamer's time and space.

Second, what is a game? If it isn't fun, then guess what, your game isn't going to sell.

Third, you do realize that fun and making money are not mutually exclusive right?

All the best games and most popular games started by being fun; not after the fact. No good game designer went ""Let's design a game solely make to money, oh, and by the way we guess we should make sure it is fun too."" That is corporate suicide.

Personal problem. Why does it matter that your kids are still developing? Seeing some penis or vagina is only going to hurt them if you raised them in such a way that it will do so. Maybe don't raise them to be sensitive?

Did you know that your children (brace yourself here) have genitals? (I know, right? It's shocking.)

Did you know that many native American tribes used to sleep with entire familys and extended families in their teepees? And when two of them wanted to have sex, they did so right there, with all of their other family in the same room.

Do you know why the kids didn't give a fuck? Because they understood that fucking is something that adult people do. They didn't care about nudity because the rest of the tribe didn't make a big deal about it.

">Essentially, we can't know anything substantive about _the purported_ Jesus or his _alleged_ ministry,

>because the Easter events eliminated or obfuscated all historical facts in the gospels.

Begs the question. Nothing in the gospels can be considered historical. The gospels say a lot about what some people believed about Jesus. All one can learn from them is matters of historiography, of ethnography. There's no way to recover any actual history from them. As Schweitzer himself pointed out. 

>As for the historical figure of Jesus, the debates are primarily about Jesus' message and teachings. 

No. Just no. The debates among the questers for the historical Jesus, Crossan's Jesus Seminar crowd, and others, _assume_ there was a historical Jesus. They aren't debating whether there was in fact a historical Jesus but rather about what people thought about the narrative Jesus. 

>My point is, however, that there's little debate about the primary events of Jesus' life among scholars. 

Gobsmacked, I am. Even among Christian scholars of Christianity and the NT there is considerable disagreement about the primary events of the alleged Jesus' alleged life. 

>There's still debate about what _the alleged_ Jesus _is assumed to have_ actually preached. 

There's even debate about the methodology used in those debates. See, for example, Jesus, Criteria, and the Demise of Authenticity 

>The diversities in early Christianity largely were Christological, attempting to understand how Jesus fit into the divine identity. [citation desperately needed] 

Also prepend ""alleged"" to ""Jesus"" and ""the divine identity."" And please tell us that how the early disputes over whether Jesus was flesh and blood but also divine, or flesh and blood only but worthy of worship, or only seemingly flesh and blood, or something else again, were ""attempts to understand how the alleged Jesus fit into the divine identity."" Just for example. After you've done that I'll bring up some of the many other instances that blow that absurd claim out of the water. 

>material can be contradictory without ahistoricity as a conclusion 

Oh that's sly, as well as irrelevant, logic-wise. ""Some material is contradictory but nonetheless historical"" does nothing to support the history of this or that contradictory material. Being contradictory doesn't rule out it being historical, that much is true. But it sure AF indicates the possibility or likelihood of it being ahistorical. Only if one can find any actual history in it, only if one can resolve the conflicts, can you say that the material is historical. To date, no one has made a very good argument that the material is historical. 


> I would further submit that the Epistles of Paul are a source for the historical Jesus,

Really? I'd like to hear your arguments on that. Because Paul said what he knew of Jesus he ""learned from no man."" He didn't hear about Jesus from any person. He didn't hear about Jesus at all. He said that everything he knew about Jesus he knew from scripture (meaning the Hebrew Bible) and from revelation. To me that doesn't to him thinking of Jesus as someone who recently trod the Earth. 

Did Paul say anything about his Jesus' life or ministry? No. (Isn't it interesting that Paul, the first one - that we know of, that is - to preach the crucifixion says absolutely nothing about the events leading up to it, the events that are and have been for many centuries the established Christology without which Christianity makes no sense? And that those crucial events were first alluded to only a decade or two later?) 

Does Paul at any point indicate that he thought Jesus was a person who recently trod the Earth? The only possible instance I can think of is Galatians 4:4, ""Then in the fullness of time, God sent [exapostellō] his Son, born of woman, born under the Law."" The verb as used in the Old Testament is connected with the sending of spiritual beings, angels e.g., or personified Wisdom as in Wisdom of Solomon 9:10. The basic form of the verb is regularly used in the OT to denote the sending of the Holy Spirit. Yes, it can be used to speak of ‘sending’ a person but the contexts make it clear what meaning it has. The identical form of the verse 4 verb is used in verse 6, to say “God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son.” That's not an argument for Paul believing that god sent a physical (or docetist!) Jesus not too long before. 

Curious too that in relation to those all important events of Jesus life and ministry, without which there would be no Xianity as we know it, Paul not only says nothing he says such stuff is nonsense! ""Jews demand signs and Greeks search for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles."" 

Please tell me in detail why you think the epistles are a source for a historical Jesus. 

>Paul's silence 

Is not the issue. That's a flaming straw man you laid out there. Mythicists don't put forth his silence as an argument for anything (except as in the above context in which he completely ignores everything about Jesus that is important to Jesus being Jesus the Christ). Mythicists cite what Paul _did_ say. (The genuine Paul, of course, not the pseudepigraphical Paul, nor interpolations like 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16 ""the Jews killed the Lord Jesus."") Abandoning the lens of modernity and examining what Paul _did_ say, viewed through the lens of antiquity as best we can, reveals that he clearly thought of Jesus as a celestial being, crucified in one of the lower heavens (yeah, must keep in mind Paul's cosmology of the heaven__s_ as a series of literal domes above Earth) and resurrected there as well. 


>First century secular sources. The idea of a ""secular source"" isn't exactly coherent at this point in time, 

OP spoke poorly. What he should have said was ""extra-biblical sources."" Of which there are exactly zero.

There is a whole shitload of archaeological evidence. Which, of course, is the best evidence one can have in historical investigation, far better than the utterly unreliable testimony of the gospels.

"I read your argument and I think you are using a sentence that was without doubt poorly phrased by me in order to push pretty strong opinions.

1) I agree that instead of saying «You will change your mind», I should have said: « Not wanting a child at a moment in life is sometimes (could I say ""often""??) a temporary thing in life. As all our decisions/positions in life, they can change in life, and there are many cases of people who in their 20s did not ever envision to be parents and who later for many reasons felt it was then the right time for them to be parents.... » 

2) I can try to phrase my opinion with all the caution necessary, making sure not to overstep the freedom of the person on her choices. However I find also equally unproductive when someone writes in this forum about her hesitations/doubts/fear of whether to be a parent or not, and Tens of people line up to stress that she/he is right not to want kids and to enforce her in her belief. 

3) I don´t want to sound arrogant or whatever, but I just think my reaction if someone is 20 y/o and has doubts/fear on being a parent would be different from the case of someone who is 45 and is happy without kids. to the 20 y/o I would just say, let life run it course, you may change opinion, many have done, some have not, don´t focus on this issue ... to the 45, I would certainly say that as long as he/she has a fullfilling life, helping others... then he certainly as accomplished as everyone else.

4) I don´t think that sharing my experience can be dismissed as an Anectode . We are all here sharing our experiences. In this case, everytime someone refers to a real life experience you will be dismissing it. 

5) Your first sentence in last paragraphe is really confusing me: « Let's use real arguments about having kids versus choosing not to, and give me some facts». First of all because you ask for facts, but you tell me not to use my personal example. Are you expecting statistics? Some big arguments such as how society would evolve if a majority of people decide to staty childfree? Second because I consider having a child or not, a personal choice, there is arguments going stacking the positive aspects vs negative aspects and drawing a universal conclusion for everyone. 

6) Waving the big flag of ""Respect People Choice"" while sounds when said this way, shall not be used as a way to shut up those who have a different opinion. People come here to share their stories/opinion and hear other ones. Entering attack mode by digging the weakness in the written sentences to dismiss the underlying argument is actually also unfair.

7) Your initial argument establishing a symmetry between telling someone who does not have a child ( but still is plenty in the age of having one) that she will (I agree I shall have said she may) change her mind vs telling someone who has a child and telling her that she will change her mind is to my opinion Flawed. Because actually the situation is not at all symmetric. 

In the case of young childless woman, If you say to her that she will change her opinion, I am not insulting/hurting any kid ( none exists) and I am not highlighting to her an irreversible situation because she will still be technically able to have a kid. She may tell me it is not my business( fair enough) , she may change or not change her opinion and will be happy anyway.

However telling someone who has already a child, that he will change his/her opinion is an absolutely much worse and horrific argument, because the child is there, you are telling something absolutely terrible regarding a live person, and the person ofcourse has at no point the choice of changing that.

Note that I am absolutely cautious and respectful to someone older ( 40s or so) who are childless and childfree, bringing up the arguments of kids in this case - I would agree - is absolutely bad and insensitive

"The downvotes probably speak for themselves, but you, ClemsonPoker, are exactly the type of person the article is discussing.

Not only is ""philosophical masturbation"" just a sesquipedalian way of improperly categorizing both my and the author's points (though, admittedly, it sounds good despite being both obfuscatory and incorrect), but the whole ""people are fucking stupid, so you should only listen to the smart ones"" is exactly the type of elitist ""at least i'm smarter than the stupid people"" thinking that's addressed in the article.

You also missed the point of specifically categorizing Idiot as the counterweight to Genius. The ""stupid people"" you're referring to are just members of the Average class I so carefully defined. 

You're probably thinking: ""Man, this guy uses big words and all, but he doesn't understand what i'm saying. I just think it's better to listen to smart people and so many people are stupid... why is he laying into me like this?""

To answer, and hopefully teach you an important life lesson: 

 Let me first say that ""intelligence"" can be defined along any number of dozens or hundreds of facets, lines, areas, realms, etc. I'm sure you have friends who (e.g.) are better with foreign languages than you, but can't handle even the basics of linear algebra.

 Once you recognize various types of intelligence, you can begin to factor in experience and training. When i have a question about the historical-sociological implications of certain culture trends as evidenced by Hegelian cycles that predate Ancient Rome - I ask a brilliant college professor who not only has a preternatural disposition for knowledge collection and analysis, but has spent decades honing these skills. However if i want to learn to make a really-fucking-good donut, I'm going to the undereducated, ex-gang member in the kitchens at my favorite donut shop - because, in the world of donuts, that guy is as brilliant as my professor friend.

 Lastly, stupid is not as stupid says. A genuinely ""stupid"" person (by your standards) may actually give great advice, demonstrate sound reason, and open your mind to a lot of things you would otherwise miss. At the same time, I know lots of genuinely ""intelligent"" people who, for whatever reason, get stuck on ideas/beliefs and say really, really dumb things. E.g. not every Romney supporter is stupid, but every single one of them is behaving stupidly out of a) affection for what the Republican party used to be and stand for, b) family loyalty, c) etc. etc. etc. Reasonably, logically, and candidly there is no way to defend one's continued to support of the man - but that doesn't stop plenty of (at least reasonably) intelligent people from doing so all the same.

So yes, you should be discerning in your information intake - but discern from reason, experience, sound logic, emotional maturity, etc. If someone misuses ""when"" and ""whenever"" (which really pisses me off), that doesn't mean that everything they say about math/economics/art/whatever is immediately debunked because they're ""really fucking stupid"".

TL;DR I undertand that you're a teenager, but if you'd grow up and stop being an elitist little prick, you'd realize that everyone out there has some value and knowledge to offer you, even if they don't meet your standards of intelligence."

Women having the choice to do what the want is patriarchy?

>The commercialized sexualization of women

In ancient Rome (and Greece to a lesser extent) men were sexualized to a far greater extent than women, while women were seen more as secondarily sexual. This is why there are a massive number of male nudes in art and sculpture, while the only female nudes are crudely drawn titles to decorate whorehouses. Men's sexualization was much more commercialized (though women's sex itself was also commercialized in the form of prostitutes, it was seen much more as a bodily function and the beauty of the women was not focused on as much as the beauty of the man). Unlike modern society, they were explicitly patriarchal (the husband/head of household ruling over the family unit). Was that explicitly patriarchal society matriarchal because it sexualized men?

"A Legacy game is a game that:

A Legacy-ish game only satisfies #1. That was very clear in my post.

>However from a fan of legacy game's point-of-view the self-destruction in Legacy games is not just clearly necessary... it is a fundamental aspect of their enjoyment of that game.

There is nothing stopping you from destroying pieces of a campaign game.

> I also feel like the people you describe as saying ""I don't care, it was fun"" are a bit of a strawman... you paint them in a very cavalier light. While no doubt some people take this attitude to legacy games I would say a more common reaction to legacy games, at least that I have seen when reacting with fans of the genre, is that of someone who goes from initial skepticism of the utility of the legacy aspect of permanent change/destruction, to someone who sees there is a fundamental difference, for them, between board games with a re-settable campaign aspects and the finality of playing a game with permanent changes.

I have never met or talked to anyone who was skeptical about the idea and changed their mind. Every person I have ever talked to about it have been of the very cavalier attitude of ""it's Pandemic!"" or ""it's only $70"", or they've been skeptical and either had their suspicions confirmed after playing it or refused to play it entirely. So no, it was not a strawman.

>still see legacy games as...necessary.

Well that's just objectively wrong.

----

Legacy games are a very obviously (to me, at least) an attempt to gut the consumer for money. Why allow a hobbyist to pay $20 to play Pandemic forever when you could charge them $70 for every 12 times they play it? Appending ""Season 1"" takes it one step further and exploits the average board game enthusiast's propensity to collect.

Notice how none of the earlier Legacy games were a new franchise? They leveraged the Risk brand and then Pandemic (both hugely popular games, one for casuals and no one for enthusiasts) because if they attempted the concept with a brand new franchise consumers would have laughed them out the door. But instead they associated these games with familiar and well-liked brands so that people would defend them.

"Bro, calm down and come back to real life. "
"> If you take out the gas taxes provided by suburban commuters, how do you propose that we maintain our highway infrastructure? You do realize that the highway network is a significant economic and military advantage for the United States?

Well I never suggested eliminating suburban commuters (or rural people who have to drive 30 miles to get to the nearest hardware store, also contributing to gas tax revenues). I suggested that we enact policies that would reduce subsidies on those lifestyles, marginally increasing their cost. This alteration in incentives would lead some people to choose to live more urban lives, and would slightly shift the demographic balance so that a greater proportion of people live in urban areas. If you want to live a suburban or rural lifestyle, that's your prerogative, but it has high costs for the state and you should have to bear more of those costs versus them being borne by the general tax fund.

Higher gas taxes and/or tolls could generate plenty of revenue to run our highway system. I provided the evidence that less than 50% of highway spending is recovered in gas taxes and tolls, I just think that this should be a higher number.

> All this would do is shift the congestion from the highways to public transit. Have you seen public transit in places like Beijing and Tokyo? Not exactly a relaxing commute to work when you're packed in like sardines.

I think that is partially cultural. They are culturally conditioned to be used to more cramped spaces and closer contact with other people. They don't see it as a big deal. You look at other very popular transit systems in New York and Europe and they don't have that issue, people wouldn't stand for it and its an easily solved problem.

> This is really a very minor issue and you are significantly overstating its benefits. Anyone who buys a home simply for the MID is a fool who has no business buying in the first place. For instance, the total interest spent on our mortgage this year was about $6500. In the 15% marginal tax bracket, that means that our deduction is worth less than $1000 this year That's enough to cover the costs of our HOI and garbage collection for the year. Not exactly a huge sum of money. And its benefit goes down each year (unless we get bumped into a higher tax bracket).

$1,000 is still an appreciable amount of money. Again, I'm just talking about at the margin. You get rid of the home interest deduction, you get rid of some of the highway subsidies, you allow for more attractive schooling options in the city, there were already the city benefits of needing fewer car(s) and having lower energy bills, and all the sudden a few more people who were already on the fence about where they wanted to live have decided to move into the city. If reducing subsidies on suburban living shifted only 5% to 10% of the current suburban and rural population into urban areas, that would have a big effect. It would decrease energy prices for everyone, decrease oil imports, and improve the national balance sheet.

> The current system works well because the individuals who most benefit from upgrades and expansion plans are the ones who foot the bill for it.

I would argue very much against the idea that the current system works well. At least it doesn't work well for a lot of poor kids. But like I said, vouchers are a way to solve the urban education problem that I was referencing without even really taking on the issue of education for the poor. You have a voucher system and people can spend the money to send their kids to whatever school they want.

> Namely crime, pollution, noise, lack of nature, etc.

These are AMERICAN urban problems, which I believe are symptomatic of 50 years of policy that subsidized wealthier people to move out into the suburbs. If you look at europe, the downtown urban cores of the cities are desirable places for the wealthy to live and its the poor who live out in the suburbs. Pollution, too, it depends on what you mean. Yeah there's probably more litter per square mile in the city, but there's more insecticide and fertilizer runoff in the farmlands.

Of course there are personal preferences. I'm just saying that we shouldn't subsidize suburban living so much. If I'm living an economically sustainable life in a city, and yeah dealing with some of the downsides that you mentioned, I don't want to be paying the mortgage on your house and paying for more than half of your roads.

> Individuals who attack the rural lifestyle never seem to acknowledge the benefits that these people bring to the table (quite literally).

Don't even open the farm subsidies discussion. Rural people get too much support, and it's bad for the country. It raises the price of energy and funds hostile governments. If you want to live a rural lifestyle my argument is that you should have to bear the cost, the taxpayer shouldnt be the one having to pay to bring you out electricity, internet, roads, etc. That should be on you."

"Here's the thing about historical and cultural knowledge. It is more or less irrlevant, because of the claims made within the bible. 

In 2 Timothy 3:16 the bible claims ""All scripture is god-breathed and is useful for teaching, reproof, correction and training in righteousness."" What this means is that every single word in the bible (according to the bible) is meant to be used for, well, teaching, reproof, correction and training in righteousness. It doesn't go on to clarify in this specific time period, to this specific culture and in this particular context only. God is is supposedly omniscient and according to the words that he allegedly wrote, everything that he wrote was meant for a purpose. A truly omniscient god wouldn't make a claim like this unless he also believed it to be valid outside of the particular culture and historical background of the time. 

Also, the bible has an extremely, and I do mean extremely, tenuous grasp of history and what actually happened in these time periods it references, so the historical context for a lot of it is bullshit because of that.

Historically, culturally, and scripturally, the bible is an extremely poorly written text. However, even without that, just the ludicrous claims made within are enough to at least start questioning it. OP asked for what was a good place to start with somebody who the concept of god not even existing was foreign. Well, a book that claims Jesus never existed, even if it is historically accurate, might not get very far with a person like that.

"> I saw that, and their response seemed to be that the argument didn't hold up when applied to their religion.

I got that from a Christian, too. It smells like special pleading, to me.

> Because my beliefs are focused more around how I live my life than what happened billions of years before I was born? Why does the creation of the universe have to matter?

Because you were claiming that other gods don't matter. If gods are real and the religions that worship them are correct, then it follows that they do matter an awful lot. Creation myths on their own don't matter, but they're presented as foundations for why people believe in their gods. They set the scene for the story about what we're supposed to do, according to those gods.

> Because I've gotten good results from mine that I never got from what I regard as a semitic war god that got a bit too big for his britches and was then co-opted by an apocalyptic pacifist cult (and then co-opted again by a prophet that seems more aware of YHWH's original personality than Christians are). On top of that, the other side of the ""it's about life, not before life"" is that it's not about afterlife for me either. I doubt I have any say in that part, anyway. The gods will do what they will, whichever one or many it is that make that decision.

I get pretty good results without believing in any gods. Lots of Christians get good results from believing in their god. Lots of Muslims can claim the same. So can Hindus and Asatru and Buddhists and Jainists and so forth.

So we have thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands of conflicting claims all creating good results. No one can explain how that's more evidence for divine intervention than it is for confirmation bias.

> I regard my gods as real. Is it possible it's wishful thinking? Sure, but that's possible of any faith. That's kind of the ""faith"" part of it. Even if it is wishful thinking, it's working. I regard my life as better with my beliefs than without them.

Faith sounds pretty powerful. How far do you take it? Do you look both ways before crossing the street? Do you look at what you're about to eat before you bite into it? What are the limitations of faith and why do believers not apply it to every aspect of their daily lives? If a doctor's prescription isn't working, do you talk to the doctor about why or do you take it on faith that it's going to work sooner or later?

Furthermore, why would you not get the same results from faith in Hindu gods rather than your own?

> If we're only going by what a majority of people think, we shouldn't have any threads on here asking questions of atheists. They're a distinct minority. Let's only ask questions to monotheists at all, how about?

We're not. I simply pointed out that belief in monotheism makes monotheism relevant. I think we've safely established by this point that my questions are still relevant to polytheists.

> There's a difference between not ""playing well together"" and ""invalidating one another."" Your original question is how evidence for a god justifies eliminating all others from a conclusion. That question, quite simply, does not apply to the vast majority of polytheistic religions. Most of us don't eliminate all others.

When you have religions that claim to be the One True Faith and all others are deceptions created by the Divine Adversary, you most certainly have religions that invalidate each other. If Islam is true then your beliefs most certainly cannot be true. Likewise if your gods are real then there's no way that Jesus told the truth.

"You are asking how a reward (a type of power) for goods/services (profit) is influential to what a person does- how is that not obvious? Do we have to start this conversation with acknowledging basic psychology of positive (reward) and negative (coercion) reinforcement and their affects on behavior? Tailored rewards can be influential, I assumed that was obvious. Read some B.F. Skinner if you want to learn more about different types of reinforcement.

You say consumers influence capitalists... How? Via money, and buying power. More money; more buying power; more influence. 


Not to mention, you're ignoring the power of equity (ownership) of a company; consumers only decide to buy, sell, or hold, they don't make specific production decisions, like whether the firm should take on more debt, hire/ fire workers, or invest in R&D. It is the responsibility of the owner(s), and the managers the owner(s) delegates to, to keep the product in line with the market for the end reward of profit. It's almost like you don't know shareholders control a company.

> Maybe you should try googling the DDWRT supported devices list. It's MUCH longer than the list of new routers that don't support it.

As with all info with DD-WRT it's often years out of date. The changes made by manufacturers are often in firmware updates where once you've installed that firmware (or it came new from the factory with it) then third-party firmwares can't be flashed, and flashing back to an older firmware may not be allowed either.

> One manufacturer is an outlier, not a good example.

ASUS and Linksys also locked down various models.

It may have improved in the last 6 months, but the point was (as always) thirdparty firmware for routers is not trivial for end-users and suffers from various ups and downs like the FCC regulations, and for that reason it's going to be easier for most people to just have a PiHole."

>I am well aware this is ""alpha"", though I think that name is a buzzword and not really representative of what's happening here.

After having a look at the planned pipeline(can't find the source at the moment. It showed up a few months ago. Not the roadmap.) I would have to disagree. It looks like much more traditional gamedev than alpha being used as a ""buzzword"". I believe it was Brian Hicks that gave a clear outline as to the dev cycle, with condensed alpha and beta periods.

>So no, alpha is not where they throw features out there and see what sticks[...] And no, beta is not where all the bug fixes happen.

Not what I meant. Alpha is the initial implementation of all the key features and mechanics for the game, and beta is when the majority of the polish, bug fixing, and fine tuning comes into play. During alpha, bug fixing is not a priority. 

Of course, different studios follow different cycles, but this seems to be the cycle that Bohemia Interactive seems to be following. Should they change their development plan halfway through development because some kids are getting upset that every little feature isn't oozing polish? Of course not.

">That is what he is offering, in this case. She isn't entitled to it, but in this situation he wants her to have his friendship and understanding - he wants to be her friend.

That's his decisision. It has nothing to do with either of our points. Your point is that the male in question isn't owed sex/returned feelings. My point is that the female in question isn't owed the friendship either. These two points cancel each other out. My point being your point is moot/inconsequential. It's just Reddit-Feminist rhetoric. 

>Back it up for a sec. Forgiveness? Forgiveness is reserved for situations in which you have been wronged. If a man has romantic feelings for a woman and she has no romantic feelings for him, she has not wronged him - she has done nothing for which she must apologize and he has nothing to forgive because no wrong has been done. Just like she is not entitled to his friendship, he is not entitled to have his feelings reciprocated or his kindness rewarded by her agreeing to date him.

Unless you're a heartless beast contructed from the limbs of vanquished foes millenia ago, if a friend offers or otherwise insinuates they may be sexually interested in you, most people would feel sorry for not being able to return those emotions, and causing emotional turmoil to their friend. If you don't, that's your prerogotive. 

I will agree that using the word ""forgiveness"" was probably poorly chosen though.

> No. It's common sense to think that friendship doesn't make a man entitled to a romantic relationship.

No one said that. You're straw man'ing. 

>But no matter which way I look at this issue and mull it over and thrash it with logic, I cannot see any scenario in which being kind/friendly/attentive to a woman means that she owes you anything other than respect or kindness in return...and the same is true if the genders are reversed.

Because you are using faulty logic, and don't understand the situation. It has nothing to do with who is owed to whom. The issue is that being nice/friendly/value-giving to a woman is a sexual strategy for men perpetuated by women, that ultimately doesn't work, and then men get frustrated that it doesn't work, come to places like Reddit and make posts like ""blah blah Friendzone! Blah! >:("", and then women, berate them for expecting the advice they've been giving, by women, and Jennister Lopez Rom-Com replays on TBS to be accurate or in any way useful. 

>I see...it's all women's fault. Gotcha.

Beat that straw man harder chica. I got an app for that. 

I didn't say it was entirely women's fault...at the end of the day, the man should realize that it's bad advice, but it was advice given by women, about women, and thus no one can fault these men for assuming it should be good advice. I'm not saying it's entirely women's fault, but, like, 70/30? Yes. 

>Have you heard of /r/TheRedPill[1] ? They'd give you a hero's welcome.

Lol.

>And friendzoning doesn't happen only to men...women get friendzoned too.

Not really. Or, at least, not because of the same social conditions. Women get friendzoned because they lack the necessary value for the man in question to return her emotional investment. 

>Furthermore, how can this be a ""sexual strategy""? No sex is had between the woman and the man, and having a friendzoned male friend does not help a woman score with other men, either. Literally the only thing she gains from it is an emotionally supportive male friend.

Women don't understand themselves/their own attraction/biological triggers and give crappola advice that sounds nice on paper, but has nothing to do with how two people meet, attract, and have sex/start a relationship. In an ideal world ""being yourself"", and ""treating her like a queen :3"" and all the other stuff typically found on hot girl's Tumblr's would be a great sexual strategy. Unfortunately, nature disagrees. 

Furthermore, psychologically, women tend to not like the idea that men they're very attracted too are often doucheknobs, so I'm sure there's a level of cognitive dissonance there, aka Don Draper syndrome. 

>For women like that, it's not about sex, and it's not a strategy, and they aren't promoting anything.

I don't think you understand what a sexual strategy is. 

>Or because they are too afraid to do so. And from what I have seen, much advice that is given to men is along the lines of ""be a man, take the initiative, speak your heart, tell her how you feel, the proposal is your job, etc."" So often, the onus is put on the man to initiate the relationship...it's only in the last decade or so that things seem to be changing and women are now being encouraged at last to also take the initiative.

I disagree. Men are simply taking the path of least resistance because it was offered by women, not wussying out on their sexual script, but that's an entirely different subject/conversation.

>I have never heard anyone promote this, be they male or female.

>generally when guys come online here and describe this kind of situation, everyone facepalms and then goes off on Mr. Nice Guy for being so naive as to think that the woman he loves will be able to read his mind and know how much he cares when he refuses to speak up for himself.

I would be so bold as to say I doubt you've ever paid attention to it because you're a woman and it has nothing to do with you. I don't pay attention to the quality of lipstick brands either. 

>At any rate, I find it fascinating that you pin all the responsibility for these scenarios on women and none on men. 

I didn't; you straw man'ed that, but the issue is primary one created and perpetuated by women. That's not to say there aren't problems created and perpetuated by men, but as you are a woman, I would never except you to agree that your gender is responsible for a wrong doing, nor would most men agree our gender is responsible for a wrong-doing if we weren't berated day after day that all women's problems our our fault. 

>Women are to blame and men are helpless victims.

Helpless, no. They get advice from a bad, yet logically natural source. If you want to prevent a fire, no one expects the fire department to be a bad source of information on fire prevention...

I really think you need to spend some time in a cultural studies department. I don't think you're going to believe anything obfuscate_this or I tell you. The point (you will disagree, but it remains a fact nonetheless) is that rape has been desexualized in many social studies and humanities departments for decades (since the 1980s at least), and it has long been career suicide to even suggest that there are any genetic differences between races.

Since I've already linked to the standard, de facto assertion of much of academia on rape, let me give you the same for race:  http 

Then there's this bombastic political polemic published in an academic journal:  http  . In case you don't want to click the link, here's how the abstract begins: ""For centuries, the colonial governments used a combination of race and ethnic characteristics to subjugate and control people of color, and scientists of the day provided evidence of the ""natural order of things"" to support national policies of domination, segregation and control. There have been many examples of events in the past 70 years to suggest that achievements by ethnic peoples are not genetically determined and that race and ethnicity are merely terms to describe external features, language, culture, social mores and folklore.""

Yes, because that person doesn't know which door the first person picked. The 1:2 odds comes from a reduced knowledge about the system. The odds are increased to 2:3 when you have more knowledge about the system. This is how probability is calculated, from knowledge about the system.

This is not true.

Because if you don't tell them, they would still be stereotypical, but without knowing it, so they would not even interrogate themselves about the stereotypes they are acting upon, and if that is what they really want or what was imposed to them by society/culture/education.

If you are born in a society where everybody says ""black people are sub humans"", and no one interrogate that, nobody say ""you are wrong, you are racist, thinking and acting upon that hurt people"", then you'll continue happily living without knowing that you are racist and that world could be different. If someday, someone come and say ""you are racist, the way you act because of your education and the society you are in is bad and hurtful"", maybe you won't change, but at least you can start to interrogate yourself ""Am I acting bad ? Why is it bad ?"".

No. It's telling you why you need to deal with it: You will never, never be able to control what other people think. Worrying about it is a waste of energy.

Yes. And let me tell you what I wish someone would have told me: You're not special. You're not an anomoly. You're not cursed. You're not noble for bearing this cross. You're unhappy and you're too scared to do anything about it and you're making excuses for not changing. I don't care how you start changing, but you need to start taking baby steps to improve your life or it's never going to get any better and it's only going to get harder as you get older. Start by doing something simple like walking every morning or drinking more water. Do something for yourself because you think you're worth it, fuck what other people think.

Man, stop. There's not a fucking chance this is true. I'm sure you feel like it's true, but I've been where you're at, and I know that half the time you look at a girl you find attractive, your self-hate kicks in, you decide she's too attractive for a guy like you, and reject yourself before you even try with her. Like I said: You're not special. You don't have some big secret insight to incelibacy. People have been where you've been before. They stuck their heads in the sand in the face of the truth too. It's a normal reaction. It's much easier to just say ""That's how things are"" instead of putting work in and doing uncomfortable things to make life better for yourself. 

I promise you, it's not going to get any better until you start putting in work. If you don't feel good enough, that's not because society is labelling you an unwanted virgin, it's because for some reason you feel unwanted due to the fact that you still have your virginity. You need to take a deep look inside, possibly with a therapist, and start untying those mental knots you've got against knowing people deeply and being known in return.

You're never going to find the love you so desperately want until you can learn to love yourself, even just a little bit.

>Even Democrats acknowledge those findings are a problem.

>“They’re pretty bad,” said Democratic strategist Brad Bannon, who connected the poor poll numbers to separate findings that show a broad number of Americans don’t trust Clinton.

Can someone explain to me who Brad Bannon is and why his opinion justifies ""promotes Dem fears"" as a fact-based headline? I have a competing theory, this is a headline that's being upvoted because it's what users here want to believe, regardless of whether or not it's true.

As far as the so-called ""establishment"" is concerned, the strawman painted above of ""Dems in charge"" is beyond ridiculous. Those that have endorsed HRC understand far more about favorability ratings than you do. I can recommend a little background reading on the matter.

Nate Silver, Dec 2012:
 
> But if Mrs. Clinton runs for president in 2016, one thing is almost certain: she won’t be as popular as she is right now. Recent polls show that about 65 percent of Americans take a favorable view of Mrs. Clinton, while only about 30 percent have a negative one. Those are remarkably high numbers for a politician in an era when many public officials are distrusted or disliked.
> 
> But part of the reason for Mrs. Clinton’s high numbers is that, as secretary of state, she has remained largely above the partisan fray that characterizes elections and fights over domestic policy.
> 
> Over the course of her long career, the public’s views of Mrs. Clinton have shifted along with her public role. When she has been actively engaged in the hand-to-hand combat that characterizes election campaigns and battles in Congress, her favorability ratings have taken a hit, only to recover later.

Now that's incredibly prescient. That's just a teaser, reading the whole article is important. 

Hate the system, by all means. Please do work hard to change it. But you're all making fools of yourselves throwing this online temper tantrum. There are legitimate criticisms to be lodged against HRC that are lost in the white noise that's being generated through posts like this.

Iraqi army doesn't have to fight ""America's Wars"" it has to fight for an Iraqi Iraq, you know, one that is represented by its entire population and not being controlled by a Sunni minority, in the form of ISIS. You see, if the Iraqi army just backs off - the biggest losers would be those currently in power the Shiites of Iraq whom are the majority.

Now, don't get me wrong - that majority ever since they got back in power because of the US have done a lot of shit towards the Sunni minority that encouraged stuff like the rise of ISIS (such as massacring hundreds of Sunnis in a peaceful protest), arresting random Sunnis in a manner that resembles the gestapo and kicking Sunni ministers out of office, sending them into exile or simply put arresting them. Still though, all things accounted you'd think that the Iraqi military which is mostly composed of Shiite would rise to defend Shiite ruled Iraq, but it hasn't as it was used that the US was there to make sure everything stays put."
"> Averaging them over regions will create a false picture.

That's what a statistical map is. That's what statistics itself is. Based on your logic, the very sentence ""24% of inhabitants of Estonia are ethnic Russians"" creates a false picture because it is based on an average over the whole country.

What you are saying is that every statistical map ever creates a false picture. I don't think you quite understand the concept of a statistical map.

> Seriously, why not paint the entire Estonia and Latvia as mixed then if you have an agenda to push?

Because the symbol allows a much finer resolution. And I don't have any agenda.

> It is incorrect as this mixed area starts sharply at 10%, making it look like random areas in Estonia are mixed

There has to be some cut-off point. 10% is a reasonable cut-off point for recent minorities.

> yet your methodology creates an imprecise picture with too precise borders

As does every statistical map ever.

> A map is not supposed to do that for god's sake...

The map is based on purely geographical criteria because—using the symbols according to their resolution—because, as you rightly noted, that is the point of the map. However, if it creates a correct impression of the overall size if the minority, that's an added bonus.

A map is supposed to convey information with geographically distributed symbols. People will subconsciously judge the size based on how much is covered; there's no question about that.

If the minority were visually overrepresented (e.g. when a reader would think, based on the map, that 50% of Estonians are Russians), then we could debate that maybe the methodology should change in the case of Estonia to avoid this. But the minority is visually unerrepresented (looks smaller than it is) when the normal mathematically sound methodology is applied.

> if you knew anything about international law, you would not spew the about Estonia having had the obligation to grant them citizenship.

I am not saying Estonia was obliged to do that by law. Sometimes, you know, people are kind to each other just because we are all human beings.

Those people were mostly ordinary people, who were born in the USSR and just moved from what was one part of the USSR to another part of the USSR. It was one country during their lifetime. Their children grew up considering Estonia their home.

Now the country collapses and they find themselves stateless, considered foreigners in a country they have spent their entire lives in.

Can Estonia do that, based on international agreements? Yes. Is it a dick move? Absolutely.

> Being born in a foreign country does not grant you citizenship in most countries of the Old World.

Cheating on your wife or being rude to everyone is not illegal. Does that mean there's nothing wrong with doing it?

What Estonians did to their Russian minority is appalling, to say the least. Most of those stateless people are completely ordinary people who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Their situation is a result of racism. Legal racism, but racism nevetheless.

> This is absolute rubbish and these organizations are often controlled by Russian officials and Estonia strongly protests their opinions.

Are you joking? Those organisations are some of the harshest critics of Russia in the world.

> Most of these reports are based on utter lack of knowledge, they are simply factually incorrect...

Simple factually correct facts about ethnic groups tend to be denounced by racists everywhere in the world. Just saying.

> Estonia has no problem with discrimination against its minorities

If you Google ""discrimination of Russians in Estonia"" and click on the first link (to Quora), the most upvoted answer is:

Yes, as they should be. Russian people invaded and destroyed Estonian culture and language. It’s only fair if Russian culture and language destroyed too. [...] Russian should be banned from use official language of Russia should be English. We’ll see how much they feel bad when they are at the brink of extinction.

I am sorry, but this is some of the worst kind of racism there is.

A quarter of your population has very limited rights with regard to the use of their mother tongue in middle and higher education and when dealing with the government and local authorities. You have an entire governmental agency that bullies teachers, clerks, bus drivers, etc., who do not speak Estonian well enough, even if they don't need it in their occupation.

>White privilege is why AHS cult has to be about white people AGAIN

In the past AHS has brought up issues about race RELEVANT to the storyline and from the top of my head has featured three interracial couples where their race was a factor to the plot, but apparently that's not satisfactory since alpha Asian men didn't dominate the relationship.

>Don't you think AHS Cult Season SEVEN should have finally been abut nonwhite, leading characters?

They possibly could've done a better job with ""diversifying"" the cast in skin color, I guess. But tokenism isn't a panacea. I've loved past AHS players like Angela and Adina and Gabourey not because of their melanin, but because they're phenomenal actresses who play their parts incredibly well. You also have to understand that the US is over 2/3rds white and that the AHS audience is even whiter than that, so obviously white characters are going to be involved. 

AHS has gone above and beyond in featuring lesbian, bisexual, gay, trans, disabled, poor, (ir)religious, etc. characters when other shows' idea of representation is just a melanin quota. Diversity isn't just skin-deep. And you're not helping in this exclusion culture by saying that Asian men, etc haven't received representation when clearly they have far more representation than LGBT and disabled characters. Oh and you're failing to consider that Japan has the world's 3rd largest media market, China is now the largest, and India and South Korea are in the top 10. While Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Iran, Pakistan, the Arab Gulf States, and Indonesia are also all massive media markets. And I'm pretty sure they feature more Asian characters than LGBT."

> As it is right now, whether there is life or not is a yes or no question, and we have found nothing.

There already is life, so it's a yes. The question is, ""Is earth the only place in the entire universe where there is life?"" and the answer to that question is, ""Possibly, but it seems highly unlikely.""

Look, I have a degree in philosophy. This doesn't work on me. You don't get to draw a false equivalence between a natural circumstance that gave rise to the universe and an entity that is an agent and a creator, and then think that all you have to do is argue that the entity loves us. You still have not demonstrated that there exists an agent that created us or the universe. You just say, ""We're here, so we were created, therefore there is a creator, and he loves us."" It's a ridiculous non sequitur and anyone reading our exchange will see it clear as day.

Well, a grand jury and the supreme court of the state of new york thought otherwise. In order to have probable cause that a particluar action was reckless, you need to think about the history of that action. Again, this tactic used to be taught at the police academy and has been used tens of thousands of times over the decades with exactly two fatalities, both of whom had severe asthma. Do you think driving on the highway is a reckless act? The chances of getting into an accident are about the same as killing someone with a 15 second chokehold. 

>The type of force they used was negligent. Doesn't matter if they had the legal right to use force: they used a technique that is against policy because it is dangerous and the man died as a result. Negligence.

Really? Again, tens of thousands of uses, two deaths, both of whom had severe asthma. Just how negligent was it? More to the point, was that negligence CRIMINAL? Here's the New York Times on the issue: 

>The New York City Police Department has banned the use of this particular hold, but the grand jury would only consider this to the extent that it indicated whether the officer was intentionally trying to kill Mr. Garner, acting “recklessly,” or in a “criminally negligent” manner, the legal definitions of various levels of murder and manslaughter.

>It's relevant because they had the situation under control. 

No they most certainly did not. If they had the situation under control he would have been in handcuffs. After all, that's what they were trying to do. Also, how quickly do you think they could have lost control? 

>His size and weight are irrelevant. He's not stronger than 3 cops combined.

Uh, he is physically resisting arrest. His height and weight are VERY relevant. How do you know he's not stronger than three cops combined? What if he's as strong as three cops? Even if he wasn't he still could inflict some serious damage. Why should they risk that when they are allowed to use physical force? Unless he intended to kill him, he was trying to save his fellow officers from potentially getting hurt and quickly gain control. Perfectly legal. Would be a cheap shot in a fight, but why should criminals have an equal chance to hurt the police? Fights between the police and criminals are never fair, and they never should be.

>Nobody. He wasn't violent at all.

Well, he was yelling, and physically resisting arrest. Is it such a stretch to think he could potentially become violent? Shouldn't the police attempt to regain contrl as quickly as possible to avoid that? They do have a legal right to.

holy days
Yom Kippur- a day of fasting and prayer to get right with God. The weeks preceding Yom Kippur are spent remembering wrongs that they committed in the last year and apologizing to those people. Then on Yom Kippur, they can all come to God for reconciliation knowing that the person that they wronged has already forgiven them. The nation and individual start the year clean and new.

Social ethics:
Pay off your workers the same day that they do the work. 
Don’t hold grudges; rather love your neighbor like you love yourself. Commitment to the wellbeing of another shown through actions no matter what the cost. Neighbor means anyone with whom we have connection in any way.

">How much overlap do you think there is in the readers of sites like Tumblr and Buzzfeed, and people who actually should be lectured about feminists issues?

Quite a lot. This is why I think it's useful because readers of buzzfeed can start to have a little more feminism brought up to them on the regular. Some will choose to look deeper into feminism which only helps. Some will continue to hold the same beliefs they had before reading an article, no harm no foul. Some may twist around something that they read and make incorrect assumptions but as I've stated multiple times there isn't enough factual information in these articles to actually be mislead about anything concrete. But if someone is mislead it's easy enough to correct because buzzfeed is very general by nature.

>Wouldn't the Occupy Movement been a lot more credible and thus more effective if they actually had their facts straight? You could argue that the Occupy Movement didn't actually achieve much of anything, so why would the Buzzfeed articles about feminism achieve anything either?

The OWS movement spawned greater consciousness amongst the entire country of the vast wage gap between the ""1%"" and the ""99%"" and the unfair ways financial institutions are able to hold on to that money, forcing it out of circulation. The results from this ""awakening"" aren't easy to quantify but certainly can't be called negative. Keeping people passionate about the state of inequality isn't bad either. It still does more good than harm.

>In my counrty the actual wage gap statistic is roughtly 3% when you look at women and men who work in the same sector with the same job description. That gap is explained by the fact that men tend to take a lot more overtime work than women, and generally just work more hours. The real issue is the costs involved with pregnancy and the understandable reluctancy from employers to hire women who might receive paid maternity leave in the near future. But hardly anyone knows about this real issue because we're overwhelmed by the irrelevant memes from Buzzfeed and tumblr. Besides that, most (if not all) of the things Buzzfeed is fighting aganst are completely trivial compared to the hardship women face in non-western countries.

You're really blaming buzzfeed and feminist memes for the reason behind people not being aware of the reason behind the wage gap? That's a pretty big leap. Nobody looks at a gif of a cat and immediately thinks ""well this is all I'll ever need to know about feminism."" And if they do then that person is a danger to many parts of society and the fault is on them or their upbringing, not buzzfeed. Morons who actively seek to populate their mind with only the baseline information on a subject and then aggressively use only that to form an opinion on the entirety of an extremely complex issue aren't the people we should cater our media production to. Nor are they the people that we should predicate judgment of buzzfeed or anyone else based on.

I'm merely saying buzzfeed is a good source for being exposed to a popular side of feminism through harmless gifs and entertainment. It's not the most educational, but it does have the power to influence people to further educate themselves, or a place for people who are in the struggle to feel validated and a sense of camaraderie with other women who are experiencing similar treatment and emotions."

"I feel for you. I feel for what you went through. This movie was supposed to be your big break. It was supposed to give you the opportunity to rub elbows with Tarantino and Johnny Depp and maybe even Spielberg. Right? 

You had DeCaprio and Macguire on board. It was all in place.

But the thing is, once you took someone else's money, the movie stopped being yours.

You were given budget by a production company, yes?

You were paid for your time, yes?

Your actors and crew were paid for their time, right?

Money wasn't taken out of anyone's pocket and you do yourself a disservice by pushing that victim narrative so hard.

I'm sure you know very well that Hollywood vaults movies all the fucking time. And I'm sure you know the showbiz adage that ""You're only as good as your last show"". DiCaprio was gearing up to be an enormous star, and Maquire pretty big himself. They or their production company looked at Don's Plum and decided ""You know... this isn't the one. This isn't the thing that we want pushing us into the next project.""

So, they decided to take it off their market. That's the right of the people with the money. The moment you signed their contract and took their money, it stopped being your movie and started being their movie. They decided to do what they thought was best for their most valuable assets involved. You were not their most valuable asset involved, although you could have increased your value. Leo and Toby were. 

Now. In my opinion, the right thing to do would have been to throw some extra cash at you for the hassle and sort you out with an agent and maybe a good enough next gig. One that would have been better than any other that you'd ever had by virtue of it's existence. It isn't like you had Harvey Weinstein knocking down your door, right?

No. You didn't. And like it or not, when it comes to Hollywood, probably more than anywhere else, you have to play ball to get ahead.

Your biggest mistake with Don's Plum is that you failed, and continue to fail, to accurately evaluate the value of that film.

In case you hadn't heard; Diner's been done. You're film has none of the watchability of Tarantino and none of the challenge of Von Trier.

You weren't making art. You were making a commercial product. Everything that comes out of Hollywood is. Some might have artistic merit, but that's just another selling point.

The whole film as some holy construct idea needs to die. It inflates egos and it poisons the well. 

It isn't that I don't understand why you'd want to push to get this film out. This isn't the first time you did it. This was a news item back around 99 too, if I recall correctly. You've spent 20 years stuck in this one thing. What else have you done? 

I'm sure finding options is an increasingly hard thing for you to do. But the moment you stopped playing ball, you soured yourself with two of the biggest stars in Hollywood and by virtue of that everyone connected to them by at least 3 degrees. 

For a kinda meh film. 

What do you think is going to happen here? The movie comes out. A bunch of people watch it. There's some press about young Leo and Tobey. It'll get mediocre reviews overall. You might rake in a little cash. It'll ultimately be forgettable and forgotten, good only for some internet tittering on throwback thursday every now and again. 

Otherwise, I don't see much coming out of it for you either way. I don't envy your position because a second big break? That's not coming. Hollywood is intensely tribal. If Leo says ""fuck this guy,"" then you're fucked. 

Serious question: Do you think that you're going to get some sort of big break and become The Guy Who Directed Leo's Lost Indie, with a red carpet waiting to put fifty more projects in your hands?

"A lot of people (read: women) don't seem to understand what a cat call is. Generally I've also noticed a corrolation between women who get offended by cat calls and them generally being at least a bit narcissistic.

See cat calls are (most) of the time not coming on to you. I mean do you really think a guy thinks he has a chance at you by saying such lewd things? Please, stop assuming it is all about you and realize there are a few reasons guys cat call.

#1: they are trying to get a reaction out of you. Basically, they are not hitting on you, quite the opposite, they are making fun of you. This is stupid, but they do it because it works. Most women flip the guys the bird, try to make a comeback... and automatically lose the game because the men's plan worked perfectly. They got a reaction out of you.

#2: They are trying to impress their friends. I think this actually is what cat calling truly breaks down to, on a sociological level. Cat calling a girl is something a pretty brave (read: stupid) man would be able to do. Note the fact most men cat call when they are with their friends, and then all the friends join in. The first one to initiate is showing his bravado to the others, ""hey look at how brave I am I am going to say something stupid now""

This is not to be confused with hitting on you. You can generally tell if a guy seriously means what he is saying (read: he is a dumbass who doesn't understand cat calling) pretty easily. Primarily he would do it when alone (thus he doesn't have anyone to even impress) and this is kind of pointless, but he is an idiot and doesn't understand it. You can go ahead and flip this guy the bird.

tl;dr:

Guys cat call to impress their friends standing next to them, not you. In fact a LOT of stuff guys do is to impress other guys, not you. In fact anything a guy does to impress you when he is with the rest of his peers, the act of impressing you is actually him attempting to impress his friends.

Nothing makes your social standing among other guys go up higher than doing something stupid and/or impressing a women. Keep that in mind."

"> Why is his character now above killing superman who he admits has the potential to wipe out everyone on earth if he desired. 

You'll note that he never expresses any of this to Clark. He's learned his lesson from his villains and he keeps the villain monologue short, and here's what he says: 

> I bet your parents taught you that you're special. That you mean something. My parents taught me a different lesson, dying in the gutter for no reason at all: the world only makes sense when you force it to."" 

Aside from being a sick pull from The Dark Knight Returns, it's also a bit of insight into Bruce's real motivation here: he wants to prove he can still make a difference. This was never about Superman; it was about Bruce's helplessness when a bunch of immortal aliens showed up. The first thing the movie shows us is he day he decided to become Batman. The second thing it shows us is the day he decides to kill Superman. They are very much related to his inability to act in either situation. He's this great crimefighter, having bested who even knows how many villains in his twenty years, but once the Black Zero showed up, that was it. His goose was cooked. It was only because Superman showed up that the day was saved. So Batman did what we all do and rationalized and made excuses and focused his hate until 

> Bruce doesn't stop kicking Superman's head in because he recognizes humanity, he does it because they have mothers with the same name, hence the flashback to the scene with his own mother. 

You mean until he flashes back to the moment where his own father's last thought in this mortal plane was for his wife? As he prepares to deal the killing blow to this man that he knows, on some level, is a good person trying to do the right thing? And he sees this person, this alien freak call out a woman's name, knowing it's the last thing he'll ever say. Just like his father, so many years ago. 

And then bam it's that Pulitzer winner from that newspaper! ""It's his mother's name! It's his mom, homie, chill!!"" and oh my god it all comes together. That little millennial piece of shit Lex Luthor kidnapped this dork's mom (he has a mom? a girlfriend??) forced him to come fight (oh my god he even said ""Lex wants us fight"" how fucking stupid am I?!) and is probably using us as a distraction for something else. He must have been behind the Senate bombing so I can't even imagine what he's up to now oh Jesus oh Christ we need to do something get up, dork!! 

That entire scene makes perfect sense to me, and if you want to twist facts to make it about the sheer coincidence of their mothers both having the same name, I can't stop you, but it doesn't change the narrative's sequence of events. Sorry. 

Speaking of narrative sequence of events: 

> The movie would have to have Bruce make some turn where he recognizes the sanctity of life or acknowledges his ways have become more jaded and he needs to return to a more fair system of judgement. I can say neither of these things happen cause he then precedes to slaughter guys in that compound to get Clark's mom back. 

You and I have very different definitions of slaughter. Let's go over this scene again: he approaches a band of elite mercenaries who are using military-grade weaponry in an urban environment. One of them fires at him with a powerful minigun, so he takes a second-- taking fire-- lines up his shot-- still taking fire-- begins to shoot at the ground in front of the merc-- still taking fire-- crawls his fire toward the merchant, giving him plenty of time to just jump out and run away-- still taking fire-- and then finally blows the truck up underneath him. Explain to me what Batman did that was morally wrong. Would a cop or a soldier have been wrong to ""slaughter"" this man in that way? Then, Batman enters a room with ""two dozen [armed] hostiles"" without even a gun. Yeah, he probably killed a couple of them (looking at you, crate guy whose head magically starts gushing blood in the Ultimate Edition), but they got off easy. SWAT or, hell, the Punisher would have just fucking killed everyone. Batman literally showed them mercy by merely putting most of them in the hospital. And yeah, maybe he was cruel for eye-for-an-eye'ing the guy that stabbed him (poor criminal mercenary ) but he sure did mess up that perfect Bruce Wayne blood sample that guy had just created. Then he shoots the tank of the flamethrower a guy was about to use to cook a Midwestern mom alive with. 

What a fucking monster. 

Damn man it is super hard to take these complaints seriously. 

By the way, his turn doesn't happen until after Superman dies. He helps save Martha because it's a pretty good apology to Superman, but also because he has already begun to swallow his pride and realizes that only Superman will have a chance of containing whatever Luthor is cooking up in that ship. The actual change of heart comes later, though, when he doesn't maim Lex Luthor, who absolutely deserves to have that bat branded into his fucking face. But Batman walks a different path now. 

He has rejected the ""beautiful lie."" 

One more thing: 

> This is irrelevant because Clark has destructive capabilities and powers that need to be checked no matter what.

And as other Redditors have pointed out, even the rigs from the Big Three Japanese manufacturers (who haven't innovated anything, ever) are now being assembled in China.

Is the Baofeng as 'good' (for some subjective value of the word) as your Yaseu? Probably not. Does it work? Yes. Do they get people into the hobby who weren't able to afford it? Yes. Do I get 90% of the radio for 30-50% of the price? Yes. Will Amazon replace it if it's DOA? Yes. Why wouldn't I want that?

As for the people who can't program it, there's another old saying and it's ""you can't fix stupid."" And based on where I'm sitting, listening to the CB-convert hams on their Yaseus and Kenwoods in West By God Virginia ramble about how Obama is ruining the country, etc. I'm comfortable with the bad manuals (which is really the problem, not the radios themselves) keeping stupid people off of the air. They should sell more of them to this crowd.

EDIT: I own more Big Three radios than I do Chinese rigs. I'm happy with both. The Chinese rigs have their place, and they're what got me started when I first got involved in the hobby.

">objective 

In what context? The market as an acting force is made up of people who have no interest in pursuing objectivity - by its very nature, individual actors within the market will act entirely within their own frame of reference (i.e. subjectively). 

Worse, the amount of influence that each actor has is proportional both to their assets and to their willingness to influence the market, while their intent has almost no impact on their ability to influence the market.

You portray ""the market"" as some kind of democratic system, or as being a representation of what people really want, but it's as far away from that as possible. Not only do ""the people"" have little influence in the system, but marketing and psychology research show that the people can easily be influenced or even told what to want.

>creative

Markets sometimes drive creativity, but they more often stifle it. A seller or provider in a given market has great incentive to only stay with what has worked in the past, and little incentive to create something significantly different. 

Similarly, startups that attempt to bring something new to the market almost always fail, but those that attempt to improve on an already established market have a higher likelihood of success - even though there's relatively little creativity involved compared to researching and developing something entirely new. Markets polarize around only that which has been demonstrated to work, but that which could work is often ignored if it hasn't already been proven out by someone else.

It would be one thing if it were merely a misunderstanding of circumstantial evidence. But in this case, there was no evidence. Instead, the prosecutor decided to make his case by putting my city and my country on trial. He sold the jury on the idea that Knox comes from a society of liberal deviants who enjoy strutting around to other countries to kill people.

During the first wave of deportation (June 13, 1941), 11 000 people were deported from Estonia. And don't even try the favorite Soviet apologist line, ""they were the enemies"". Out of that 11 000, 5000 were women and 2500 were children under 16. Most of the rest were judges, officers, lawyers, scientists, government officials, medical doctors and so on.

"I've made many posts time and time again - you can read through them - showing that China's historical ""aggressions"" were nothing but reactions to aggressive neighbors with the only possible exception of Vietnam (but even then I outline in a post the complexities of Chinese-Vietnamese relations). 

But by stating what you have stated, you are ignoring two important things among others: 

1. That a Westernized, Imperial Japan was the one that plunged the rest of East/South-East Asia (and later itself) a hundred years in the opposite direction of development - and the one that, during the Imjin War, ravaged a prosperous Korea that only managed to remain independent thereafter against this slew of ravenous samurais because of the checked interventions of a Ming China. 

2. That Qing China got simultaneously gang-raped by Western Europeans to the south, the Japanese to the East, the Eastern Europeans to the north and west, and a baptized package of smuggled British opium directed anus-wise in the centre (Taiping Rebellion and Opium Wars). Do you mean to victim-blame China here? Even the staunchest anti-Chinese keyboard warrior wouldn't try to spin these events as anything more than druglord Whites trying to push their shit on the Chinese. 

If China is looking like a bully now, it is only because it has no choice in a world where the Western way of doing things has proliferated even in its immediate vicinity. 

Truly, kowtows to China are not necessary (it is substituted for the very public economic dependence of the world upon China), but peace is - a peace that will never come while the peoples of Japan and Korea harbor elements of the American military within their own borders, stationed with the precise aim of isolating and destabilizing China.

No. A queer space is a queer space, but you cannot ban someone based on their sexuality or gender.

I do have a right to exist where my friends are. I'm not straight, but I am in a long term heteronormative relationship so everyone assumes and then occasionally I get the one boy (who believes he cannot be misogynistic because he's gay) who likes to get in my face and viciously attack me for being at a gay bar.

"> Distant? She rose an undead army, murdered the opposition and seized a previously human kingdom-fortress. The only thing that makes her different from the Lich King, in W3:TFT, was the scope and range of her actions. Just that.

She rallied undead who regained free will.

She not only retook Capital City from the Scourge itself (clearly defining an opposition to the Lich King), but had one demon leader slay another.

Killing Garithos was at the very least, a way to secure the land for herself. If that's ""Lich King"" esque, then so is King Thoradin who united the human tribes to form the kingdom of Arathor to begin with.

> Were they? Because that's an assumption. No written material outright states that the Forsaken and the other races of the Horde were under the impression that Varimathras had proven his loyalty.

No written material outrights states that the Forsaken and other races of the Horde weren't under that impression.

So, it can either be spelled out explicitly, or the minor leap of ""One of the faction leaders of the Horde has a dreadlord advisor"" to ""Guess that dreadlord advisor has to be vetted, somehow.""

> And there's when Chronicle vol.3 falls short, because they choose to don't portray or address such impressions.

Chronicles will always ""fall short"" in this regard because it's an overview, not every nitty gritty detail.

> Even if effectively taken by the Forsaken, Lordaeron was in the most weakened state out of all nations. There's no mention to other people's concerns about that. Everyone ignores Lordaeron by the moment Sylvanas puts her foot in there.

What help they could have provided Lordaeron, they already had. We know reinforcements were sent at least from the dwarves. People will have ignored Lordaeron because the largest group of resistance (Garithos') had fallen.

> I'm criticizing the fact that she isn't considering possible imminent attacks, and acts as if she had an invulnerable plot armor surrounding her, sending envoys out to the Alliance and the Horde.

This is a ludicrous criticism. She sent envoys precisely because she knew she was vulnerable.

This is not a difficult concept.

> I don't see how Othmar Garithos has a place in this epistemologic process.

The quote: 

> could be under immediate attack anytime soon and instead her only choice of action to forge allegiances is sending envoys

Implies that Sylvanas had burned bridges by slaying a representative of the Alliance -- Garithos -- when she did. And that is arguably the case. Diplomatic ties with the Alliance should have been easier if Garithos were kept alive.

If that wasn't what was being referred to, then sure, Garithos is irrelevant.

> Peace accord? Did she have a peace accord with the Alliance?

> I don't think she did.

> She might have ended up with a peace accord after joining the Horde, but that's not the timeframe I'm addressing in the suggestion you're rebutting.

It was a misspeak.

It would be nonsensical for the Forsaken to attack the Alliance in order to befriend the Horde when the Horde had a tenuous pact with the Alliance at this time.

> Your remark implies that people can only show concern by one thing at a time. I don't think that's how quality writing goes.

Explain why Sylvanas would be a concern, then.

If it's because she has a dreadlord advisor, that's simply not good enough. Especially when it's quite possible that the Alliance don't even know if it was her hand that took Garithos' life (well, Varimathras', but under her command).

> Because a handful of actions in a very small timeframe is enough to deem a demon-commander of the Burning Legion loyal.

Slaying one of your ""brothers"" in front of your new warchief was deemed enough of an act.

Perception of loyalty is subjective. Do not act as if Sylvanas was ""objectively wrong"" to have believed that to be enough. As quality writing goes, characters have their own views. Sylvanas' view was that Varimathras had done enough.

> That writing direction is a poor excuse to handwave the Forsaken into a playable faction and makes no sense when everyone is suddenly Varimathras and nobody is questioning how much everyone is trusting him out of nowhere.

Again, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

In other words, there is no canon stating that anyone was oblivious to Varimathras. So there is no cause (or sense, frankly) in assuming they were.

> Even if he worked to deserve said trust, his work is minimal. 

This is completely subjective.

> Not even worthy of a position of military leadership (he commands the Forsaken forces in Vanilla and even hands out missions) in any realistic world.

In any... realistic world.

Well, then.

> Think on any work that portrays a strong military force, and then imagine one of the enemy army's generals switching sides and being put in a position of utmost power after nothing but a handful of actions that don't even harm his previous faction.

You've missed the important point that everyone else but the Burning Legion on Azeroth knew that Mal'Ganis was not truly dead.

Nor did they have a real grasp of the Legion's true strength.

They were led to believe -- because nathrezim are indeed devious -- that the dreadlords' defeat was a significant one for the Legion. In a way, it was; the Legion desires Azeroth very much and they lost control over their Scourge in the Eastern Kingdoms following this. But of course it was not as significant as Varimathras let on, even conjuring up that ""rule"" about never slaying another nathrezim.

> The humans used ships to sail to Theramore. Survivors of Lordaeron. You'd think they would be more than willing to sail back to Lordaeron in a campaign to kick out the actual weakened ruler.

After having recently fought at the Battle of Mount Hyjal, finding new land to settle (because Lordaeron is ravaged by this point), and not wanting to deal with the Scourge that remains? Scourge, not just Forsaken.

Stop ignoring that point.

> Go back to #4, up above, where you just mentioned Garithos.

> She is weakened, but ignores the possibility of imminent attacks.

No she doesn't. Read Volume III. She is desperate. It literally says ""desperate for allies."" Why else if not because she is under pressure? She certainly is from the Scarlet Crusade, that much is also explicitly stated.

Read the book.

> Ironically they do make an effort about being hyper specific about Anveena Teague, the Red Pox, the Gorian Empire and the breakers, primals and colossals.

If you think they were being hyper specific about Anveena or the Red Pox, you are gravely mistaken.

The history of Draenor on the other hand, was not previously covered well at all in other media. This is largely because it wasn't so developed. Chronicle Volume II elucidates plenty about the history of the world, including confirming that the Titans (well, a Titan) did indeed stumble upon it and order it.

Contrast that to these Warcraft III events -- which are often depicted in game -- and there's a clear reason for the ""hyperspecificity"".

> ""their"" in the phrase ""their concerns"" refers to the ""nations of Azeroth"" in the above point 1.)

And the Horde and its nations are included in that. Their concerns were clearly expressed within the book.

> If you're satisfied with that little amount of wording (""well, they considered for a moment before adding the Forsaken to the Horde""), then I conclude that you're not looking for quality writing.

And at this moment, I conclude that you're doing nothing more than attempting to be belligerent.

This discussion is going to go nowhere. You're clearly set in your opinion, so I'll leave it at that. You clearly misunderstand many elements described within the book, despite them being (quite clearly) stated. Yet you want more to be stated.

As suggested previously: try more to understand rather than demanding something different. Because right now it is pretty clear that your disappointment stems from your own lack of understanding and not ""bad writing.""

And that isn't an ad hominem. It is advice. Playing the ""I can quote logical fallacy"" game isn't going to do you any good here, either. Especially when the ""ad hominem"" is an innocuous observation that seeks to explain the difference in opinion, not undermine the opinion.

When it comes to the issue I originally posted about: My friend and I, after having read the retelling of the legend, were puzzled about its implications. You must understand, as feminists, how much we hunger for legends which show women wielding power in some other way than through a) seduction (like, say, the mermaids in the Odyssey) or b) their faithfulness to a man (Odysseus's wife Penelope.) Here, Libuse´s power is different. She begins as a Queen revered and respected by all but, having solved a dispute between two land-owners in a way that angered one of them, she is told, in front of everyone, that she should not rule because she is a woman (""long hair, short reason."") She willingly gives over the thrown but warns the people that men can be unfair rulers. Her speach about male rulers is, in fact, quite scathing and shocking, considering it´s translated directly from a 1900s retelling of the legend. Libuse goes on to say, however, that if the people wish, she can tell them where they will find their new ruler. When they plead for her to advise them as to his whereabouts, she tells them to follow her horse. The legend then implies that the man she said would be ruler is a man she had visited many times at night, i.e. her lover (which is why her horse knows the way). So, yes, she gave over the thrown but she instated a man who was her lover and took her advice once he was king. 

I wish I didn´t have to recount the whole legend to you like this (I still suggest you read it as the spoken dialogue is translated directly from the most famous retelling of the myth) but I wanted to demonstrate that it´s strikingly different from other treatments of women in legends - although, one could also argue that, underneath it all, it is the same old thing. It´s simply not clear-cut. I cannot say this is a celebration of women and their right to rule but it also displays some pretty powerfull female characters and an explicit critique of male dominance. It´s this ambiguity that made me want to ask what others thought about the legend´s feminist implications. "

"2K18 was far too forgiving. They had balanced passing with those ridiculous throws going out of bounds that everyone hated. (Mostly because high school kids can make those passes, but NBAers can't?) This year, they balanced it so risky passes are being picked off just as they would in a real basketball game.

The problem is that everyone has been trained by 2K18 to think ""This is a safe pass"" and they're getting rudely awoken to the new reality. The people who are adapting quickly are the people who really play basketball because now the passing is simulating what they're used to in the real world. But I feel really bad for the people who only know basketball through previous versions of 2K. Their brains are saying ""This is a safe pass... WAIT! How was that intercepted?"" or ""It's safe to dribble the ball in front of that guy... WAIT! How did he steal it?"" and it's going to take them a while to reprogram so they can play the game properly again.

"Two things:

1) You have an attitude problem. I go out of my way to help you learn Japanese for nothing in exchange. You should be more thankful and less defensive.

2) If your course doesn't teach が, then you need to drop the course because it's useless. If a textbook doesn't put は vs. が somewhere in the first few chapters, then you need to drop that textbook. Any decent course or textbook will clearly show the difference between the two particles very early on. (Although it generally takes most students far longer to really grasp the difference.)

I do not speak just from my own personal experiences. As a matter of fact, I couldn't speak from my own personal experiences, because it's been like 10 years since I started learning Japanese and I remember hardly anything relating to my personal experiences as a beginner learning Japanese.

I speak from the fact that I've read countless tomes on the topic of Japanese grammar, and every single one at the basic level introduces the difference between は and が as either the first lesson on particles or somewhere very close to it. This is because は and が are probably the two most common words in the Japanese language, and the two words most fundamentally related to Japanese grammar.

Not putting は and が at the very start of a Japanese grammar class is like an ESL class where subjects and verbs aren't covered until chapter 10."

Well, I'm older and I've seen this since Reagan. It may go back 100 years, as there seems to be a Republican playbook.

But, let's talk about debt.
1) We've got the largest military in the world, by far. And Mr. Trump want's to expand that so we can fight 2 wars on two continents. This is the fallacy of the next war will be like the last war.

The next war, was this election where Russian Trolls swamped the internet. We need an increase in cyber capability.

But, my point is, Repubs always terrify you about the debt, it's a big number, and then go and blow the debt up with outrageous defense spending. Debt: 1) Military spending, and 2) Depressions, where the social safety net gets used a lot. ( Food Stamps ).

So, you may have become convinced that the debt was Obama's fault. Well, he's still cleaning up Bush's debt Tsunami.
Obama paid the Food Stamp bill, but Bush (R) made that bill necessary. And Obama's paying the VA, veterans administration, bill, but Bush made that bill necessary to pay. 

So, in the future, you need to run on Reagan's motto: ""Trust but Verify"". If your going to be a Republican, verify everything they say. And soon, seriously, you won't be.

Then, to find out what is the ""Optimal"" tax rate, you should look at the successful countries around the world. The success have higher taxes. Countries like Denmark have respect for every citizen, they don't put them in Personal Debt, so that the rich live like French Kings. 

The thing you will learn is that at higher taxes for the rich, the rich get richer, and the nation gets richer too. Did you know that France has one of the HIGHEST Productivity rates in the world? How does the us beat France in productivity? Not by giving us education benefits but by cutting our wages. Is that how you want this country to grow?

"Oh please... he implies that I am being overly emotional and not thinking clearly and thus dismisses the validity by implication.

Apropos the 'especially racist for his time' claim, that is so popular these days: What is the basis of this claim? That some modern novelist said so in a blog post? That Joshi once said so? 

Compare what Lovecraft said with what his contemporaries said and—more importantly—DID.
Have a look at this for historical context:
 http  In case you don't know, Lovecraft lived from 1890 to 1937. 

Now, nobody would dispute that Lovecraft was no fan of multiculturalism. However, the actual severity of his racism compared to others of his time is greatly exaggerated on a regular basis. 

Lovecraft's biological racism was mostly confined to black people. These views, of course, are deplorable. However, it is important to know that they mostly reflected the science of his time. When judging Lovecraft, you may also want to note that Lovecraft expressedly says in one of his letters that he would be the last person to wish black people any harm. Let us be honest: Seen within the context of his time, this sentiment alone would be enough to dismiss your claim. Racist: Yes. Especially racist for his time: No.

By insisting that Lovecraft was especially racist for his time, essentially, what you are doing is to deny an inglorious chapter of Western history: Large parts of the American (and European) public held similar views. You are using Lovecraft as a scapegoat.



As for me 'begging the question'... Where in my original post do I advance a proposition which requires proof is assumed without proof? 

To your last point: Of course, it is not bad writing to introduce the thematic center near the beginning of a text. However, that is not what I pointed out in my post. One might propose that TSoI is built around two revelations meant to shock the reader: 1.) The townsfolk are fish people. 2) The narrator is as well.

Now, if we follow the interpretation that fish people are simply a metaphor for immigrants, then the first revelation would appear to fall flat because it is spoiled early on in the passage I quoted. 

Either way, the idea to equate the Deep Ones with immigrants does little to advance our understanding of the story. Instead, it has actually caused critics, including Joshi, to struggle to deliver a satisfactory interpretation of the final revelation.

"Alright I can't explain this any simpler. Seriously.

In baseball 3 outfielders play. If Gardner and Ellsbury are 2 of those then one does not replace the other.

And, again, you can make your comparison. I am telling you that it isn't the best comparison and offering an alternative. 

You seem to make no real arguments here. Excuse me if I'm wrong but I'm trying to simplify your arguments so that maybe we can figure out where are are confusing each other:

>Cano can be compared directly to Ellsbury.

I offered an alternative approach that would more accurately determine the net WAR gained/lost from these two contracts. I feel like we are arguing over one another so I am not going to repeat myself.

>categorically wrong and you're categorically right. I think both sides have merit, albeit one more than the other, but it's not fair to treat the other side as if it had zero value.

I don't actually agree with this. I honestly think comparing two different FAs at different positions is wrong. Also, regarding the straw man claim: I claimed this because he was manipulating my argument and taking portions of my argument and going SEE. Without context. This is a fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent's position. Thus, straw man argument (I essentially stole the definition from Google).

>I have a hard time accepting how you posit, at one point, that $/WAR is a widely used tool, but cannot bear any comparison of Ellsbury to Cano (especially when you go into WAR increase/decrease by position). If we're playing in the universe of WAR, we understand the idea of comparing two different players at different positions, which is exact and expressed purpose of the statistic. 

The argument does not center around WAR. It centers around the fact that one player does not directly replace another here. It would be different if one 1B replaces another 1B - you can easily show the change in WAR over position.

Maybe opening this up in a hypothetical will make this easier:

Ellsbury + Infante or Cano + Soriano. 

Now we have players at both positions. Now we can compare total WAR. 

Comparing Cano to Ellsbury completely ignores the fact that these two players are not slotting in for one another. This is pretty simple.

> For example, the Yankees have made plenty of signings that were rooted in ""this guy can give us a ton of merchandising revenue"" -- just look at the incentives in the A-Rod contract, that was clearly the motivation for much of the mammoth contract, not his on-field value. 

The Yankees made most of these signings in a time without a strong luxury tax or decentivizing measure. These times are no more. 

The Yankees live in a world where they believe the cap matters. This is essential to understanding why they said no to Cano. You cannot compare the past anymore. 

>Top analysts also directly compare Cano's and Ellsbury's contracts. I still think we can discuss it, though. A better approach than $/WAR, I think, is considering the $/WAR of players gained through FA, and cut out guys who are still in arbitration. I have seen this statistic floated calculated, and it puts most contracts into a completely reasonable light, and I also agree with the reasoning behind it. I can go and find it if you'd like, but I was trying for brevity.

Yes please. If it comes from a reliable source or has data to back it up even better. "

Sigh. Doesn't change the fact that the problems existed less than a month ago. Why not wait one more month for a phone that is superior to the Evo?

Also note that some of the problems are not repairable by OTA software updates. Of course, you already knew that but chose to ignore it because you would rather turn this into a piss fight than an actual conversation about the devices, wouldn't you?

Awful battery life, hardware recalls, poor manufacturing, glass separation, light leakage, dreadful Wifi, updates as late as July 1 being pulled because of poor implementation and issues, many many problems with market apps not working, etc.

That's assuming you can actually find someone with an Evo in stock.

Note that many of the articles and citations are from late June to early July.

">markets are an efficient means of assigning relative value to commodities based on factors like demand and cost of production.

It's the cost of production and namely the science of extracting value from the working class that socialist initiatives should seek to subvert. Personally I think coordinating our efforts with interuptive technologies could be a means to achieve that. But I think I'm in the minority.

>Also, regarding terminology, ""commodifying"" things is basically about giving them a value, so that they can be traded as a commodity.

Right, giving them a monetary value. But what is the value of a commodity? Does steel get it's value from its extrinsic worth? Or does it have a social value as a resource? A ceramic cup might only be valued at a few dollars, but its social value is measured in its ability to hold liquid for consumption. This is the crux of what I'm trying to get it: I don't care what a crypto currency is valued in trade, in which instance it becomes just another financial tool, a bourgeois means of extracting capital. I'm concerned with how it can be used to build social value, without relying on capital.

>Bitcoins are data entries on the network, not nodes. The miners are nodes, and control of mining is incredibly centralized. At last count, the top four mining operations controlled an average 53% of mining power and the top three ran 63% of ethereum.

Thanks for the correction. My point is, banks are just data entries, a complex set of ledgers. 

Also I'm not advocating for BTC or Eth. Both are too far gone, so to speak. 

As to your last point, you make my point. I think we have a fundamental disagreement about the necessity of banks. The monetary system is strangling society. It is the heart, pumping the black blood of capitalism. I mean, you're on an anarchist sub arguing for the need of financial service providers. Is this your first day? 

The experiments that are being run with crypto are worthy of analysis. The vanguard of any capitalist venture will have blood on its hands, that's what it does. If capitalists lose capital as a result of shady financial dealings, that is not my concern. But the idea that they can be used to track the economic activity of an advanced society without the use of traditional currency is what I find interesting and subversive."
"> So...the cuts were so small that the CBC just decided to alienate a large percentage of it's radio listenership? Thus hurting further arguments at increased funding as the audience shrinks?

Rather than admit that a whole department isn't necessary to their budget and kill it, thus throwing a lot of fellow employees out of work? Quite possibly.

> No...I think I'll nee to see some numbers that allow you to portray the cuts as ""minuscule"".

Well the CBC had revenue of $1.53 Billion in 2006. That's their 2006 budget, so cuts would have had to be incredibly large in order for them to be particularly significant in light of their total budget. You're the one complaining that the cuts were too deep, so I assume you've got some source that outlines exactly how much government contributions to the CBC have been cut.

> > At the end of the day though, it's up to the CBC.

> Not just the CBC. Those that fund the CBC as well. It is a public network.

That is absolutely and completely false. The government determines what total contribution will be made toward the CBC budget. The government does not have control over how the CBC allocates that budget. They cannot direct the CBC to cut unnecessary departments by budget allocation.

The CBC and the CBC alone decided how to react to their loss in revenue. It was not the only path to take, but it's the one that they chose.


And to come back to my main point, they did NOT choose to take a hard look at what their core services should be. Instead they chose the route of trying increase revenue. That was their choice.

They chose advertising. That makes me less inclined to fund their operations. (And I certainly will be listening to CBC radio less.)"

There's no excuse.

>And yet, many if not most would take Moss if the question was ""which WR would you want for a single game.""

LOL everyone would take Rice 10/10 times. Rice was named the greatest player of all time by the NFL in 2010.

Moss was an overrated bum who could have been the GOAT but his attitude kept him from that. Rice had a great attitude and focused on getting better

>Star WRs don't have a great track record of winning championships. 

Rice does. :-)

Rice has won 3 Super Bowls, won the Super Bowl MVP in one of them, and caught 3 TDs in the other 2 he won.

Because he's so far above the pack it's not even funny. Comparing Rice to Moss is like comparing MJ to James Harden (shooting guards).

>I'm not sure whose performance is worse - your view of Moss's, or your own attempt to make a case denigrating him.

Moss is the biggest ""What if?"" in the NFL.

He COULD have been great, but he quit too much and he was absent when they needed him the most.

The two videos I showed you were either cheats enabled or the last wave/Wave 666.

And if you just told me this:

> Get the upgrades you would normally get for Stock or Direct Hit or Beggars or whatever.

Then I know you haven't the faintest clue as to what to upgrade normally. Stock and Beggars follow two completely polar opposite upgrade paths, with one emphasizing a healthy balance between reload, clip, firing speed, and stun rockets, while the other doesn't bother with clip size at all, forces reload and only one stun upgrade on the first two waves and emphasizes damage.

Please, you aren't helping yourself as informed. And for a new person to try the Air Strike in Mann Up is horrible advice. I want a new guy like the OP above to get past that first few tours quickly and efficiently and stick to the current meta or general upgrade paths that work for no, not trying out something new in Mann Up until later when he's comfortable. If he was talking about Bootcamp, hell, bring the Liberty Launcher, Mantreads, and Equalizer and let's have a go with it.

But, he's asking for help in Mann Up. Give him realistic advice that won't be laughed at by others and allows him to stay a team player. For now Air Strike isn't that viable over the other rocket launchers, and only 3 rocket launchers are considered viable at all (Stock/Black Box/Beggars). Four if you want to count the Original, given it is a reskin.

And dropping any Banner for the Air Strike is not being a team player. Giving Mini crits to your team mates is better than a parachute. The Soldier being a team player is with his Banner and stun rockets. His damage is secondary, but the need to be in the air all the time to make his dps better with the Air Strike is not worth his time, and relatively unsafe in cluttered waves."

Chris Harriss, Elvis Dumervil, Antonio Gates, Kris Dielman, and James Harrisson were also un-drafted. On the other hand, you have your busts: Leaf, Russel, Leinart, Bosworth, etc...

Just about every coach will tell you that the only thing a combine can tell you is how athletic someone is, not how good at football. The best predictor of NFL success is game film. Watch Sanchez in college, even Pete Carroll knew he wasn't ready. Look where he's at now. Watch Leinart in college. He had every weapon you could ask for, and a pretty damn good defense. He lost in a shootout to a guy who also didn't make it in the NFL in his last career college game. The fact of the matter is that the guys who succeed in the NFL are the guys who have that drive to be great.

To be frank, I think our only disagreement is that combine numbers are a predictor of NFL success. If that were true Al Davis would have won every single Lombardi trophy. Its not about the numbers; it's about the translation of those numbers to the field. How fast is Thompkins in pads? How much do his numbers change when he has 25 lbs of gear on him?

No - the cab driver used Muhammed as reference, as the Muslim did. Camels were relevant for Muhammed, thus it was also relevant for the Muslim. Race had nothing to do with this.

To expand on my process of thought. The Muslim didn't want to listen to music because Muhammed couldn't listen to music, because there were no music. Muhammed probably didn't drive a car either, and seeing as camels were often used for transportation in Arabia, one can assume it was also used by Muhammed.

Anyway I don't see what your problem is at this point. They were warned of surge pricing, which lyft and uber said to expect, amd the poster said they are fine with it. Seems like a Non-issue except for you insisting there won't be a surge when very publicly uber and lyft, along with all the newspapers said there will be. Anyway if you want to refuse to believe it go ahead.

Profanity is a weak mind trying to express itself forcefully man. Try to just make your case.

They want equality? Where are the straight marches? How are they not treated as equals today?

Where is this mass murder, lynching and repression you state as fact?

I’m definitely getting along just fine with my life. I just question when people say THERE IS OPPRESSION or society is racist and state these things as fact. Then anyone who questions it or asks for evidence pointing toward it being a problem is shamed. It’s this microaggression culture where if you’re asked a question or a statement is made it HAS to be because of your race, sexual preference, etc. People scream oppression, when in fact no one really cares that they have a march. No one is really trying to shut it down. Sure there are nut jobs, but there always are. Imagine the outrage and shaming at a straight pride march. 

The fact that we’re talking about this LGBT march that is definitely happening completely undermines your point... Disagreement from your grasp on reality can exist without trying to shame people and call them small minded children."

"The concept of gender identity is interesting but the way people act as though it's totally removed from biological sex is ridiculous. Sex and behaviour correlate highly in pretty much every species. Humans are not a special case.

People for whom their sex chromosomes don't align with how they innately feel need help, and they need help from as young an age as possible. Sexual realignment (surgical or just on paper) is a potential treatment, but it's dangerous to view it as the default course of action when someone feels a bit unsure about themselves.

Yes, our success has come from working together and looking out for one another-- but we do that as families, tribes, villages, feudal kingdoms, and nation states. For countless millennia, as tribes, kingdoms, and nation states, we have frequently chosen to invade, slaughter, exterminate, pillage, enslave, and destroy other tribes, kingdoms, and nation states-- instead of decently working together and looking out for one another.

This doesn't make sense. If the other team has comparable talent and skill, then the outcome should simply be close to 50/50, it wouldn't prove anything. It just means that you're luckier in that particular game.

If the Warriors or KD wasn't good, any of this would never happen. If Lebron wasn't good, his Big 3 Miami Heat couldn't exist.

Running a trade deficit is not ""taking punishment."" Trade is not a zero-sum game. Trading internationally offers companies the ability to buy supplies at the lowest possible prices, which means we as consumers pay lower prices for goods. It also means that companies have more operating capital with which to hire more people.

You seem to just assume you've stumbled upon this special secret that evolutionary biologists sweep under the rug, yet it couldn't be further from the truth.

There have been many proposed explanations for Batesian mimicry. High-model abundance, for example, is one such explanation that has evidence in the evolution of coral snake mimicry. Or take a look at this paper that provides evidence for gradual evolution of masquerade mimicry in butterflies. There are also people who have argued that these sorts changes can occur in large leaps in some contexts, such as Goldschmidt's ""hopeful monster"" hypothesis. You also assume that there couldn't possibly be an advantages to intermediate states because you assume that Batesian mimicry is some sort of end point of evolution, which isn't necessarily the case at all. Papers like this one have made it clear that that's not necessarily the case.

"> This is just false.

So you can see the in-game world with the same clarity that you can examine real life?

> You don't need to see the whole world or have access to 5 senses in order to parse information and clues, the devs just have to design scenarios and the world in ways that encourage directed exploration. They even do that here to some extent, showing the bike at the beginning of the path the player is supposed to take, but apparently they don't trust their design skills or the player's intellect enough to let the hint stand on its own.

They did exactly what you're saying they should have done? They designed the world to suggest the direction, drawing the player to the bike. Then the player reveals more information through investigating the suggestion. Perhaps they could have designed heavy-handed footprints in the mud so the player can know that's the way to go, but after a certain point they're dedicating resources to make the game a detective game when it isn't. (Edit: And it's depending on the graphical limits of the system or of the player's setup. My TV isn't big/clear enough and dark visual clues often fail in my experience.) The character looked at the ground and saw visual cues, which is symbolically relayed to the player. 

> But the real point is that exploration is special when you get lost. Exploration in a world where you can't get lost is just pointless, imo. Exploration is about discovery and mystery, and if you can't get lost then there is none of that, everything is clear as day and may as well be linear.

That's just your opinion, and that has never been a consistent theme in open world games. I think getting lost in games when you don't have to be is a waste of time and that's exactly why developers get put in those hints. Not everyone wants to be lost in games. You've created this subjective and personal idealization of what open world games are and should be and decided that these features are an afront to those ideals, when open world have practically never consistently been what your ideal dictates. 

Open world are open on the sense that you can approach your objective from where you want. Does that mean you haven't to decipher where that objective is or explore in order to find it? No, it just means you're open to approach that objective how you want. It means there is a world for you to explore, it doesn't mean you have to be confused and lost within that world while trying to complete a mission. 

Open world games are games where the world is open. Full stop. Anything more is your own romanticization.

The arguments raised are also questionable take for example Quran, 2:221, Amin is celebrated when one recites the whole Qur'an usually between the age of 7-15 making it perefectly reasonable to expect one to understand Islam by that age.

It does. Modern Islamic scholars call for the beating of your wife should she step out of line. It was only Yousef al-Qaradhawi one of Islams most revered modern scholar. 
 
Also the stoning of an adulter is different to wife beating.

I also don't see how the adherant of such an ideology can be a good person. Yes Muhammad did some good things like the Zakat, then he went and slaughter a bunch of people for not doing the call to pray. Swings and roundabouts. I would also expect someone who saw Temüjin Borjigin, Khan of Khans the Great Genghis, as a prophet of God being a good person from his teachings, y'know the whole conquring and raping really takes away from the moral good of Muhammed and Genghis. 
 
>Maybe that's because you don't understand that no Muslim thinks of their faith as ""following the actions and teachings of a war lord conqueror""

"I think most of the reason you're finding everything irrelevant and confusing is because we're missing each other on the point here: past difficulty and pain is a separate issue from subscribing to a dehumanizing, emotionally constipated philosophy to cope, that makes an enemy out of any woman who tries to love that person. We don't want to get fucked in the heart any more than the lying-ass pillers do, but at least we're not going in with that intention, one would hope. 

I'm positive it's true that pillers are in pain. I'm equally positive that the longer they continue to submit themselves to the idea that they're entitled to systematically misuse other people in the way they feel themselves to have been misused, they will continue to be in pain. It's the definition of self-defeating; they might as well migtow it up and get into relationships with other red pill men. Those are the only people they're willing to listen to or trust anyway. 

>Attraction isn't a choice. What TRP has done is discovered what is primally attractive about men and manufactured a system to reproduce what ""naturals"" do by default. Women feel tricked because they feel like they bought a Mercedes and discovered it was a Ford Focus, not that there's anything inherently immoral about it. 

You can't fake being someone you aren't. There's no cheat code to being a self-contained, calm, thoughtful and tempered man. The only way to do it is to have the courage to examine yourself honestly, to address the things that fuck you up and unfortunately, most of the time, I hate to say it, to suffer. I've never known a 'natural alpha', to use some pretty terrible shorthand, that hadn't been through some shit in his life. His priorities straighten out. He stops being twisted up and narcissistic and transparently insecure. He's just over it. That's an alpha in my book. Not some loudmouth idiot meathead who acts like a pissy three-year-old girl. Some chicks like that, I guess, they can have 'em.

Now pillers just loathe it when women so-called 'shit test' them, lie to them and manipulate them, but feel perfectly within their rights to try to intellectualize their way through relating to her. They cannot trust women. Do you know how impossible it will always be to love someone you can't trust? How can you trust her, when you know deep down you're not acting from your heart but from your Ethernet cable, and her responses are therefore automatically invalid? You can't build trust hiding behind a giant old damn play-pretend luxury persona. 

This seriously isn't personal because I get what it's like to get your heart shotgunned out of you and I know most people would do goddamn anything not to end up in that situation again. I know what it's like to wrench and puzzle and philosophize about what happened and how to permanently fix it. But in the end there's no cheat code. You either put your heart back on the blackjack table, or you keep it in your pocket. 

If you try to play the game with a facsimile it's never going to be something that helps or heals the wounds the past leaves, you never really win, your heart just keeps bleeding in your pocket and the whole situation just fills you with contempt eventually. You hate her because she doesn't know you, but that's not because she's actually a brainless bint or would dump you if she knew you, it's because you lied to her. 

Not all women want a fucking Mercedes. Some of us wouldn't trust a so-called Mercedes as far as we could throw one. I'd rather have a genuine Ford Focus than a goosed-up knockoff of a luxury car that broke down every time I sneezed.

>I think all men and most honest women can agree women would rather be with an attractive jerk than an average nice guy. 

What? No. No, not at fucking all actually, attractive jerks are the last thing some of us need in our lives. Some of us prefer people more like us, whom we can relate to. I don't care how pretty his face is if the only thing that ever comes out of his head is shit.

I draw a deep distinction between someone who maybe doesn't have all his shit together and someone who's spoiling to make terrible assumptions about me and lie to me at the first sign of trouble. If anything can be counted on in real love, it's trouble. When I say I can't stand cruelty, I mean the systematic cruelty of dehumanization and everything that leads to.

what i'm saying is that the solution was not for her to just let me have my way. there's no way she could have made it enjoyable for me or made me agree with her, but it still had to be done. instead she could have done something like ""if you skip in the morning, you have to brush for twice as long at night. if you skip at night, you have to brush for three times as long in the morning."" and yeah, stand there and helicopter over me to enforce that punishment. for me it came down to laziness, so if it's more trouble to deal with the punishment than just follow the rule in the first place, i'll just follow the rule. if that meant her tying me up and forcibly brushing my teeth for me, it would have still been preferable to me having dentures before i'm 40. ""i disagree but it's your choice"" was/is not a viable option.

i just don't accept that the only functional approach to parenting is to throw my hands up and say ""well kids are gonna do what they wanna do, i can't stop them so i may as well not even try!"" i don't earn obedience from my kids, they earn trust and freedom from me. i'm the one in charge, not them."

"They track more than 500 promises he made on the campaign trail, the fact that it's about 400 either accomplished, in the works, or compromised upon, and around 20 that have actually been broken, would suggest that Obama is not far off in his reckoning of how the administration has proceeded thus far, especially since it's only two years in.

In terms of the loss of the public option and the warrantless wiretapping, my thoughts probably align with this quote:

>The friendly fire may bother him even more. “Democrats just congenitally tend to see the glass as half empty,” Obama said at a fund-raiser in Greenwich, Conn., last month. “If we get an historic health care bill passed — oh, well, the public option wasn’t there. If you get the financial reform bill passed — then, well, I don’t know about this particular derivatives rule, I’m not sure that I’m satisfied with that. And, gosh, we haven’t yet brought about world peace. I thought that was going to happen quicker.” 

He's caught between the right wing which has spent all their time either stonewalling anything he attempts to do, or attempting to assassinate his character in the eyes of a malleable public, and a left wing that immediately cries foul when he has to compromise or decides to take a more moderate position on anything.

And the best part is that he got into office through a populist mandate on the strength of his ideas and rhetoric with this notion of changing the way Washington operates, and now he's lost a lot of political capital because he tried to do what he promised, and the rest of Washington shut him down.

But hey, when is politics ever about compromise and cooperating in the spirit of continually increasing domestic and global welfare? It's way easier to just pick some positions, vote for the guy who agrees with most of them, and then immediately withdraw your support as soon as he compromises on one avenue you don't like."

It's called usenet. It works almost exactly like what you are proposing. It started in 1980. Before the www it (and BBSes) were the way message boards worked. There are moderated groups. There are unmoderated groups. There are alt groups, and anyone can set one of those up.

You can do that on reddit. You can do that on usenet.

If the idea of dating a women who has been with other men bothers you to such an extreme that you refuse to date a woman who isn't a virgin, it isn't because of how she looks or acts, it's because you want a toy that's fresh out of the box. 

I'm not referring to people who believe that both partners should wait to have sex until marriage, but if you think it's perfectly fine for you to have sex with as many women as you choose, but you will only marry/LTR a virgin or a woman with an extremely low partner count, that's hypocritical and frankly, puerile. 

Edit: for the record, I think it would be equally hypocritical and puerile for a woman to think her own sexual history doesn't matter but that of her partner does. It's just I don't see much of that here.

Mhm, that is two forms of communication.

By which you mean some form of UK English, dialect unspecified but assumed to be Standard UK English (ie: the general commonalities between regions).

 

So, to reiterate: 
You specified a particular class, you specified a particular region (where does ""Scottish English"" fall, I wonder?), and you specified that you consider this ""correct"" (and implied in the process that other forms are less correct). 

That latter part? Where the implication is that other forms are less correct? 
Coupled with the class specified, yes, you made a classist statement.

"You can put as many words in my mouth as you want, but note some things: 

- employment is not at a record high. Best bet is the unemployment rate is the lowest it's been in 44 years. That's not ""all-time."" Citation:  http 

- employment doesn't mean a single goddamn thing if the job sucks. And all the jobs suck. The clearest gauge of this is real wages - the purchasing power of the dollars you're getting for the work - and that basically flat. As the economy grows the dollars don't reach real people. Citation:  http 

- while companies have never been richer, the poverty rate isn't changing. It's higher now than ~45 years ago. That's absurd. Citation:  http #/faq/what-current-poverty-rate-united-states

- you talk about ""entitlement,"" but let's look at the millennial generation. Americans aged 25-35, people who should have growing families and starter homes and solid careers, are averaging a salary of $35k a year. That's $20k less annually than their parents! Their average net worth is less than $11,000! Citation:  http 

- people take ""gig economy"" jobs out of desperation, forsaking real salary and benefits for the prospect of some money right now. But even the average gig economy pay dropped 50% from 2013-2017. People are screwed. Citation:  http 

- meanwhile corporations have never had more cash or lower taxes. And what do they do with that money? Make their own lives easier. None found its way to employees - as we showed earlier. Citation:  http

No, in relation to healthcare it means developing a network of private insurance companies to pool these risks as opposed to sanctioning off this risk pool to the public sector. We believe that private insurance companies in competition with one another will be able to offer superior service to a monopolistic organization that is allowed to charge whatever it likes and spend as much money as it wants.

Yes. We agree. Good. Of course, there are some technical limits behind the scenes for this, like connection limits and whatnot. But those aren't too important.

So you've got an answer to your query, and you can't do anything about it except wait for TCP's session setup mechanism to time out. You've kicked the can, but haven't actually solved a problem.

No, there's an actual reason for this. And, just as a note, lots of the TCP connections you're talking about and piecemeal site loading goes away with HTTP/2 / SPDY protocols. But now we're getting pretty far off the original topic of reliability by local DNS cache.

>That other record will sometimes be an A record, but in the case of CDNs (so, most of the web), will usually be a second CNAME.

Ok, so earlier you were talking about performance concerns, but now you suspect a managed CDN service is going to have two or more layers of CNAME. In practice (from working for a DNS company and a company that offers CDN), you're wrong. Also, check out that DITL data, and you will see how wrong you are in practice.

>So, you do what you can to reduce the number of requests that have to be serially-made over unreliable links.

You've left out so many parts of the DNS that actually have an impact on reliability that it's sort of astounding. And again, in your scenario you're painting an optimum situation.

Just accept that a local DNS cache doesn't actually offer reliability for network outages, because it doesn't solve any of the following problems from the network outage.

A local cache can solve reliability issues with your upstream DNS recursives, which at this point on most decent providers should be anycast anyway, making them actually reliable to things like host failure, which you've done nothing to address except add a single point of failure within your own network."
"> A political system built on the foundation of the Cultural Revolution leading to perhaps the largest body count of citizens by their own government in the history of humanity. 

The notion that China's modern political system was built upon the foundation of the Cultural Revolution is utterly absurd. The Cultural Revolution is one of very few of the egregious follies committed by the CCP for which the government is willing to express public and official contrition, and razed to the ground its official institutions. 

Just today in Sina there was an article about an ex-Red Guard apologizing to his teachers for his actions during the era. These articles have appeared with increasing regularity in recent months, perhaps partially due to efforts by the Xi-Li administration to distance themselves from Bo Xilai's Mao-revival movement. 

 http 

The current political system is based on the reforms and re-construction efforts inaugurated by Deng Xiaoping when he managed to inveigle his way to the position of paramount leader in China following Mao's death. 

It may fall short of our ideals of what a just and equitable political system should be, but it has proved remarkably resilient for the past three decades and incredibly effective at improving living standards and achieving economic growth. 

Virtues of the current political system that I would point to include its largely meritocratic character - akin in respect to the imperial civil service which characterized pre-modern China from the Tang Dynasty onwards, as well as term limits on holders of the top, preventing too much power from being amassed by individuals, or a gerontocracy from forming as it did in the Soviet Union during the seventies. 

> In other words, an economy and culture that can only imitate, but not innovate. How could this economy service the entire world?

China is a late developing economy - all of which needed to engage in imitation in order to reach parity in terms of capital assets and technology. 

All countries in the world with the exception of Britain engaged in industrial espionage, widespread imitation of overseas and the mass manufacture of cheap knock-offs in order to achieve development - including Germany and Japan. 

China is just following the same path, and once it reaches parity will begin innovating on its own. 

The country already has a remarkable track-record of pre-modern technological innovation - it was in most respects the most advanced society on the planet for most of the Common Era. It's also worth mentioning that disproportionate number of the West's top STEM researchers are currently either ethnic Chinese or PRC nationals. This bodes well for the mainland's ability to innovate in future.

">>I'm not aware of life ever being discovered anywhere except earth.

I never said otherwise, but what makes you think the conditions that lead to life coming about on earth could not exist anywhere else? If I were to take the position that it’s more likely that life does not exist anywhere else, then I need to really make some assumptions like this that are not even close to being validated.

Regarding “accounting for current unknowns in the scientific world“ - there is also the obvious possibility that we simply haven’t answered these questions, yet, or we may never be able to. Again, we can take a fact that we know: “we do not currently have a full understanding of the universe” and constrast it with “we have the correct understanding that we were created by intelligent design.”

Richard Feynman had a quote regarding aliens that I think applies equally well to any supernatural belief: ”From my knowledge of the world that I see around me, I think that it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the results of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence than of the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence.” as such, I believe it is much more likely that reports of supernatural beings are the results of the known fictional stories of terrestrial intelligence. 

I will even acknowledge that we have no idea if there was some form of “design” behind the universe, and we may never be able to comprehend such things anyway (think a being living and only capable of experiencing 2 dimensions of space, it may never have knowledge of the 3rd dimension that we know... who knows what is similarly beyond our grasp?)... and I don’t know what particular God if any you believe in, but I just can’t believe that one particular subculture of humans somehow came up with the correct understanding of the very nature of our creation. Even if it was revealed to them by said creator, it doesn’t fit within the stories of this creator and the scale of its’ creations which it revealed itself too (like, why not reveal to everyone on earth?)... 

...that is all to say that if you believe in intelligent design on its own merits, cool, but if you believe in it because it backs up some other supernatural belief (Christianity etc) then I think the premise for belief is flawed."

Once again - please do me the courtesy of listening carefully to how I define my words. This isn't difficult, because I've defined them for you multiple times. Proof =/= evidence. I believe many things on the basis of evidence, even if I don't have absolute proof for them. Why are you finding that so difficult to understand?

It has relevance because I find it so staggering that so many atheists on this sub are operating with a strawman definition of the word ""faith."" Professional atheist philosophers that I have on my bookshelf don't make this amateur mistake. So I'm left scratching my head. The only possible conclusion I can come up with is that some very amateur, popular authors, such as Dawkins, continue to make this amateur mistake. Given the popularity of Dawkins around these parts, I would say my guess for the provenance of this faulty view is a very educated one.

?

>I understand that your claim is that god just gets to exist without a cause (""is necessary,"" if you want to use that phrase). But that's a claim for which you've provided no support.

Are you kidding me? I can either prove to you that God necessarily exists, which would make this discussion superfluous as you don't believe in God, or I can demonstrate that the deity in question - the one that me and Op believe in, is described as existing because of His nature; in Exodus 3:14, when asked His name, God declares it as I AM. The question is not ""why can God exist without a cause"", implying that He is a contingent being, and an exception to the rule. The question is ""why does God exist"", and the answer to this question is that it is in His nature to exist. Just as it is in His nature to be the Creator of thing that have been created. 

The question - ""what explains God"" then becomes ""why isn't God in the category of things that require external explanations"" - the answer? His nature. ""Why is God the thing that necessarily exists?"" Because anything that necessarily exists is God, anything that necessarily exists simply is (i.e. I AM). ""Why would something necessarily exist at all?"" This is an interesting question, which Christopher Menzel answers here. (Key).

This is question-begging if it's intended to be an argument against my axiom (the domain of things that physically exist is identical to the universal aggregate of it's parts) as it already assumes that it isn't true; ""probably"" as opposed to ""is."" 

The reason I called it an axiom is that it's basically the definition of atheistic naturalism: that the sum of all physical things is not identical to nonphysical, transcendent things.

I didn't know being right about something was called being ""edgy and trendy"". Speaking of trendy, feminism is the biggest up and coming trend.

Mainly I used public transportation, because most civilized nations, and some not so civilized, have excellent public transit systems.

First a general note about statistics: Statistics can be very misleading. They're often presented as factual representations devoid of bias, but very rarely is that the case. This is especially true as far as news broadcasts, and this is not a phenomenon localized in the US. 

The point I was trying to make when I said, Deaths from speeding = X. That isn't the whole story. What else was taken into account? e.g., drunkeness, weather conditions, & seatbelt usage., is that just stating a statistic without revealing your methodology is suspect. To clarify; there are other influences that were not addressed when saying X people died because Y. (In answer to your question, I think driving faster without a seatbelt would be the safest choice of the three. I'm not sure why you asked though.) If you are unwilling to actually think about what you are told and just believe everything you read/hear that is something I can't really help you with.

">So you're complaining that she doesn't dress misogyny up in bright colors? Misogyny is a negative thing, and when it exists in gaming, that's a problem

No, I am not saying she should be dressing it up at all. If you read further, I explained how I support motivating people to goals with solutions as a better way to promote change than to share a problem and use people's upsetness about it (sorry for making up the word) to promote change. The later carries me unintended consequences which, while doing some good, carries a lot of unneeded bad with it. It's the difference between good activism and bad activism and I cannot stress how important it is.

>Can you show us these studies? How much of this is due to video games being marketed solely to men, and the toxic culture surrounding games?

Sure thing.

 http 
 http 
 http 

The last one is far less important than the first two. The first one is the most important because it lists women as mainly in the ""secondary gamers"" according to the NPD study and cites the NPD study for you to look at yourself in grander detail.

And why it is this way is a very complex issue. Online harassment is definitely the reason why women don't play many online games with mics (something I wish would be better addressed in all this) and the catering to men does perpetuate the majority difference but also there is the lack of interest in competitiveness our culture has promoted in women (if it is entirely cultural), the inequality in career-driven attitudes and education attainment, and the stigma of ""boy stuff"" and ""girl stuff"". It's difficult to sort out but there is sexism there that causes the inequality. I know of no studies that clarify which one is more influential and by how much.

However, markets do not make change but react to change and interests of the people. Catering to boys isn't a problem as it's only caused by boys being the main people who intake it now. You need to change the cause, not the result of the cause, to better fix the problem. Both Anita and I realize this, seeing how her video makes change by trying to change what interests the majority, we just both are at odds on how to promote this change.

>You're making this assumption that women 'don't play real games',

First - don't put slang in my mouth. There are markets in gaming in which women are the majority, there are markets in gaming where men are the majority. The male majority is in core/mainstreaming gaming mostly.

Second, You're talking like them appealing to men is a choice on their part. They appeal to men because mainly men have play it. They don't make change nor do they determine who likes it. Markets are slaves to the will of the people, as I said. A good example of a mainstream market accepting the female market naturally would be JRPGs (remember how Japan is much more sexist than the west here). Because of the growing popularity between fangirls in JRPGs the companies determined they'd make more money supporting what is interesting to those fangirls than not. Thus, change happens naturally even in a more sexist society than ourselves. That sort of motivation is more positive, empowering, and engaging than talking of horrors and hoping to sway the minds of people. Granted that would do good too but with more trouble along the way.

>Even if women were somehow, the minority of gamers even without a toxic community and male focused marketing, that doesn't mean games get a free pass to be misogynistic.

The misogyny Anita mention is a far more complex issue than how you imply it here but generally you are correct. I'm not sure if you think I'm justifying sexism or anything.

>Yeah, they can. Games can be marketed in a way that appeals to men only. Capitalism is inherently built on social inequality, and profits from keeping an underclass.

It cannot be confirmed that if it appealed to women that it would sell better or equally. Methods to sell to women in the mainstream have largely not been as popular but markets are always trying to see how to appeal to markets that may be left out. Mainstream games are only mainly marketed toward men because they are the surest buyers. There is always the interest in opening up new markets but they are risks. This is because of the system markets are in that enslaves them to the people's interest. To make change, social change must happen first to show markets it's a worthwhile venture to take up. Anita has done this by spurring on interest in her videos.

>If market forces couldn't be sexist, then gaming should be a 50/50 split of men and women, right?

No, markets don't decide who they focus on. To survive, they must cater to those interested in them and benefit the largest amount of spenders in the most effective way. This makes markets enslaved to the interests of the people. If you want to make change, don't try to empower CEOs by going to them for change. Go to the people and get them to change what they want from CEOs.

>This statement has so many buzzwords, it doesn't make any sense.

I'm sorry this confused you. Reading it again, I can tell it was poorly written. What do you mean by buzzwords though? Rhetoric? Consumer Model?

Basically what I'm saying is she's trying to tell people of a problem and leave solving the issue out in the open, which has led to problems besides just trying to sway the opinions of people who play games. Add that to what I find to be a negative and disempowering argument for sexism in the industry and it breeds more trouble than needed in a large way. If she were to focus on identifying the problem and pushing people towards a goal while explaining why the trends there exist so we can manipulate those parts to our favor it would be much more productive and empowering.

>You should look up 'woman in the refrigerator'. The woman is being considered as property.

Absolutely not. The trend of using the death or threat of death of a woman as a plot device shows in no way the woman as property. That is absolutely dehumanizing to both parties. 

Honestly now, if you were killed and your loved one avenged you, would your loved on think of you as property throughout? 

>I really believe you're concern trolling about this.

I'm trying to share my views in a fair and somewhat neutral manner. I am not trolling in any way.

>you've come in here hyper defensive towards Anita's haters,

I disagree that I have been and, and I say this only to be truthful and not to mean anything against you, you have been the one very defensive. We can feel free to disagree. It's just important we focus on the discourse so we can reach a determination.

>accused Anita's defenders of being just as bad

That was a misunderstanding between you and me.

>deliberately misrepresented her videos

I misrepresented her property comment only slightly. The point still existed there. Regardless, it was in no way deliberate.

>claimed that the market forces that skew gaming's demographics aren't sexist

You believe markets control the people when in theory and in practice it's the other way around. The stereotype some companies have of how much women play games does nothing but lessen the amount of risks taken to see if the market is worth pursuing. That does not mean risks to try the market don't happen.

>You obviously aren't aligned with Feminism.

That's wrong, I agree with the concept of gender equality in whatever way possible.

That's exactly what your post implies. Everyone on this thread interpreted it that way and even TKDers were telling you off for such a ludicrous position. Your argument seems to be if someone does 1% TKD training then TKD is necessary for MMA and they represent TKD and prove it's amazingness. MMA fighters train kickboxing for their striking 99% of the time. Even Pettis, even McGregor. They might throw a kick in here or there but they know where the knowledge is and that is in pro MT, boxing and kickboxing trainers and training. You think 1% of the training of 1% of MMA fighters should be talked up constantly, over and over. Dude, why don't you rep boxing or something, it is trained in MMA way more than TKD and always will be? The same for wrestling, kickboxing and BJJ. Even if suddenly every MMAer started going to the dojang, spinning hook kicks and slightly wider stances and elusive movement is still only 1% of MMA, and TKD does not have some sort of monopoly on those things anyway. And even accounting for all that it's only at the highest level that it would ever count for much. At our level, ie hobbyist, the fact that you do TKD is outweighed heavily by the fact that you have never done MMA, kickboxing, boxing, wrestling or BJJ. Stop going on about it as if it is so important. Or do some MMA.

I don't really like the country that much, but it would be nice to do something different and I'm getting a little tired of the whole American thing at the moment because I have so little in common with everyone here. Most of my friends, and even my wife, are from other countries.

That being said, I think you have to understand that what you've seen on TV is not realistic. They are mostly painting a rose colored picture of what life is like for people who are either upper middle class or wealthy. Malcolm in the Middle is a little more realistic but even that isn't gritty enough. Maybe Breaking Bad is closer to reality in the U.S. Also watch American Beauty to get an idea of how the upper middle class live well but still suffer psychologically. Poverty, crime, and selfishness are rampant here. It's very isolating and there's no sense of community in most places. The idea of schools as you see on TV isn't completely realistic, plus the quality of education is below what you have available. Another problem here is how crazy some of the religious people are, and how they basically get their way at the expense of everyone else. As an adult, I have been in situations where management has led prayer at work and where if I didn't pretend to believe in the invisible sky giant and that the Earth was only 6,000 years old I could have been fired.

Find some American expats living near you and hang out with them.

">With this you answer your own question.

Huh, nice try. But stories may exist in the past. Or may exist even in another galaxy. Wait...

Yeah, Bioware made some mistakes with ME3 endings, and seems like they had to end Shepard's story on ME3 by all means for some reasons. So no more Milky Way galaxy. But it does not mean no more Mass Effect.

Who said that? You did. I don't think so, neither does Bioware\EA. Any arguments? I said that universe is too big to be shown in only three games. You said nothing, except some personal bs.

You do not want to defame your good OT memories, you think Andromeda is a black spot on the white dress, you're a true fan. [/s] Like some guys said above\below, typical elitist thinking.

And you miss so many points. Even Shepard's story leaves some questions to answer, but it's over officially. Ryder's is on different level, there's so many loose ends, and it's intended to have DLCs\new game. But financial and other problems may occur and have an impact on releasing new games. But because you think the sun was brighter back then, and ME isn't good as it was, there shouldn't be more ME content even it's supposed to be there. Selfish thinking.

"Oh the irony... you need scientific proof to believe something, yet when it comes to an immeasurable thing such as brain chemistry, you swallow psychiatry's speculation whole. Come on, my boy, think harder. I’m wondering if you have even a rudimentary understanding of how psychiatry came to be? Do you realize that every single “disorder” in the DSM is drawn from categorizing behavioral “symptoms” and not by way of a blood test or any other physical means of measure? Do you realize the homosexuality was once a disorder in the DSM? Psychiatry is not a real science and thus far can produce no physical evidence for its claims. I think this qualifies as a good reason to disagree with the hypothesis wouldn’t you? You say show me the evidence… and that’s what I’m saying to you. Once we develop a measuring stick that we can dip into the brain and return measurable results, then we should discuss labeling things as balanced or imbalanced... not before we have the means of measure. Come on, dude… that’s unscientific. 

“The majority of scientists disagree with you” Bullshit. Now you’re making claims you can’t back up. Show me this scientific consensus you speak of. You can’t. The best you’ll be able to do is gather a bunch of psychiatrists (not scientists) who are all guessing at the same thing. 

“My previous post was actually pretty welcoming in favor of discussion.” Yeah, calling my thoughts “new age, hippie bullshit” is very welcoming (also a stupid mis-characterization because my ideas have their foundation in ancient belief structures). You are a troll… and you sound off on these comment boards to express disgust and insult people. 

“The mind is a product of the brain.” I disagree. It’s a product of your toenails. I don’t really want to get into this because I suspect you don’t believe that human beings have souls or energies or whatever. To me, the mind (which I suppose means the entirety of your thoughts) is a product of every molecule in the body. That coupled with its interaction with the world. And yes, of course, yoga, meditation, what foods you put in your body, etc. all affects the mind. There is endless science showing how behavior affects the mind. 

“I claim you are incapable of knowing this. I stand by that claim.” I agree with you. That’s why I said neither of us (and no one presently) can know. But please share with me this latest and greatest “available research, (from) the experts in their fields who research this.” 

 “I think the advice you give, if taken seriously, has the potential to fuck people up.” Sure… the advice to take control of your well being by living a healthy, mindful existence is really bad advice, right? Wait… what? No, chucklefuck (to use one of your very diplomatic terms)… doing yoga, eating healthy, being mindful… these things can have nothing but positive results in people’s lives. I’ll grant there is a place for medication, but in the vast majority of cases I believe it is unnecessary. What is really dangerous (and does fuck people up every day) is labeling them disorderly because of what is often times a temporal condition and then putting them on (and making them dependent upon) drugs that have a slew of nasty side effects (Don’t even get me started on how shrinks get extra doe for schilling out these drugs).

I will not apologize. Psychiatry deserves derision. It’s a pity how it has usurped the minds of the masses, and I intend to refute it any chance I get. Chemical imbalance is a “baseless claim, and a dangerous one” to begin with, especially when the “cure” is psychotropic drugs. And you do realize when they prescribe these drugs they really have no idea how the patient will respond? Does that sound like responsible science to you?

Why are the rich inherently evil? This is clearly projection.

"Ok, I have two issues with comparing the label ‘incel’ with something like ‘metalhead’ or ‘sports fan’.

Firstly incel is the only one of those labels that is self harming, by identifying as an incel you are viewing yourself as less of a person, it’s by definition an incredibly hateful way to view oneself. And once you start hating yourself then that leads to you hating others and the world around you.

Secondly, I don’t believe you can just be an ‘incel’ part time. You may not be doing incel activities 24/7(like posting on incel message boards) but if you are identifying as an incel, even as part of your identity, you are essentially saying ‘I am not good enough to be loved’.

And when you’re in that head space, then every action you take is dominated by that idea, which essentially leads to self sabotage.

You might not be sitting around all day chanting ‘I hate myself’, but that doesn’t change the fact that it is there constantly, like an oppressive weight affecting everything in your life.

So what starts off as just a label ends up becoming a cycle of self hatred that, if not broken, then becomes a death spiral.

I know a lot about self hatred. Shit, I could have been classed as an incel long before the word was even invented. And I was an alcoholic to boot, which just increased all of that negativity by a factor of ten.

The only reason I’m mentioning this about myself is to say that I did that, I lived my life that way for damn near twenty years. 

And then I stopped. If someone who was as far gone as I was can come back from it, then anyone can.

There are no lost causes and no fucking person on earth should ever call themselves or think of themselves as an incel.

"> If you force mass immigration with the express intent of making the native population disappear over time due to interbreeding, that's an act of genocide.

You are playing fast and loose here with the term ""genocide"". Most people understand it to involve mass murder. Your argument rests on the scientifically baseless assumption that collectives can experience pain and death.

> I don't think it's moral, and the end result is the same: An ethnic group disappears from the face of the Earth, never to return. That is the definition of genocide.

Again, intermarriage isn't exactly what most people would call genocide. 

Moreover, you need to explain how collective identity is relevant to morality. Morality is about conscious suffering and well-being, and science provides no evidence that groups are conscious entities capable of experiencing suffering. 

You are confusing terms and concepts (e.g. force) that apply at the level of the individual with ones that apply at the collective level, and vice versa.

I understand that this stuff can sound convincing. I get it, I really do. It's tempting to buy into something that makes you feel like you've got the world figured out and everyone else has the wool pulled over their eyes. It's a lot more work to really parse things out, look for internal contradictions, and realize that there's a little bit of truth in a lot of different places.

"I'm glad you brought up that line, because someone I follow addressed it last night (that's how prevalent the ""Cat is a dumb bitch!"" attitude is).

When Cat says this, she's been at Bran's bedside for a long ass time, not eating, barely sleeping, just musing on the fact that her son might never wake up. She is mentally and emotionally exhausted, don't tell me you've never said something harsh that you've regretted later (and she does feel guilty later).

So what did you want Cat to do? Did you want her to treat Jon like her own child? That's not how things work in Westeros, and she was totally justified in the way she treated Jon. It doesn't make her a bitch, it makes her a person who is incapable of separating the child from what he represents (which I stated in the OP). What would being upset with Ned resolve? It'd make her unhappy in her marriage, cause even more tension between her and her husband, etc. So she deals with the hurt and the embarrassment and shame. She's not a ""bitch"" to Jon, she's distant. She doesn't owe him anything, child or not, and Ned is the one who should be feeling shitty/be blamed if his wife isn't coddling his bastard. 

She isn't a bitch, and you've lost any credibility you had for having a mature conversation when you resorted to gendered insults, so congratulations.

UnCat is not Catelyn Tully. She is a shell of her former self, a being that lives solely for revenge. She doesn't care about anything but murdering Freys and anyone else involved in the Red Wedding, she doesn't even care about finding her children anymore. That right there should be enough to tell you that she isn't the same person that was Catelyn before she died.

You can't compare Beric and UnCat. Beric was resurrected multiple times immediately following death and he admits to not really understanding his life anymore, forgetting the things that made him him, not remembering anything except that he was sent on a mission and had to fulfill it. Catelyn was dead and submerged in water for DAYS before Beric resurrected her. Are you seriously telling me that you expect the result to be the same? Zombie Cat =! Cat."

A lot of people aren't pissed. You know why? They moved onto a different game or activity while they wait for the update.

>clearly they fail at this, see the demo perk tree?

""Now let me blatantly ignore all the other polished content in this game that isn't bad to make my nonexistent point."" I have. It's nothing special, but it's no where near the level of how bad the Zerk tree (or entire perk) was. Pretty much every skill in the Zerk tree was useless. I at least see some skills players could take advantage of in the Demo tree. None of the perk trees are super awesomely balanced, but I didn't expect that in the first place. They made it sound like for every tier, one skill was going to be for soloing, and one for teamwork. The major problem is that the teamwork ones are kinda lackluster. This is something they're clearly willing to fix based off player feedback.

>and yet they refuse to work with the community

I already addressed this. It's all early access, regardless of whether or not they release it one at a time or all together. People don't seem to realize if they have to release a small update each week, the build time is inevitably going to be longer. Having to spend every week hacking in some temporary fixes to game breaking bugs just to get a build out with a new weapon is not smart. Having to constantly tweak and change perk skills is just going to add more time. They're also working on improving the engine itself, so I don't see how they're going to be able to reasonably do this.

I don't know why you expect to be involved with literally everything. TWI did not release early access for you to be their head game designer. They released early access so the player base could help balance the overall game, and they are. If TWI wanted your input on game design, they'd ask.

You didn't have to buy the game to look at a skill tree and say it's bad (clearly you're willing to do this without playing the update). If you feel they've wronged you, I suggest you stay away from early access games entirely, because what TWI is doing is not at all unusual for a game developer."

"> Being pulled downwards by gravity and not being held up by anything else is.

They are ""held up"" by their tangential velocity. The acceleration on them from gravity is in equilibrium with the change in the direction of force caused due to it. This prevents them from falling. This is why an object can in theory orbit an object forever. 

> The object accelerates downwards

And as it accelerates downwards, the direction of ""downwards"" changes, so it doesn't ever actually get to move downwards, i.e. it never falls. This is how it avoids hitting the ground. I dunno what you don't get about this or how you picture things just falling forever and not ever running out of meters to decrease."
"Actually, IAT tests have a long and established history of strong predictive capability.

All they are testing are the strength and linkage of semantic concepts within the brain. Its more akin to asking a person what a color a blue shape is, and then asking again but this time its the word ""orange"" colored blue (or the Stroop effect).

The more implicit, linked, or un-interfered a connection is, the faster a person can respond. The more interference, the further the link, the longer it takes to respond.

You can in part determine this because other studies have been able to purposefully bias responses in individuals to test semantic priming (or the effect of recent information on immediate cognition). Prime a person with information of the positive contributions of a group of people, and you positively bias their implicit associations towards that group. 

But most of Reddit is uneducated on this because it turns out, cognitive psychology is actually a fairly deep field and covers things people might not have heard about before. Which I know is a scary thought for some people, but its okay.

"> to say that they don't encounter it in day-to-day life is very glib

To say they do encounter it in day-to-day life is very glib! I live in a very multicultural city and I am lucky to witness racism a few times a year max. I certainly wasnt saying they had never experienced it ever. Im saying in a nation with an ethnic majority of 98%+ racism is going to be very rare for the average person.

That has very little bearing on the level of day to day racism experienced among Japanese people living today. The largest of these groups is <200,000.

No nation is 100% ethnically homogenous. Japan is about as close as you are going to get.

Women 'belittled, underappreciated and underpaid' in tech industry

I wouldn't call it irrational to read these sorts of studies and decide to maybe major in something else.

> You are suggesting that women have more pressure than men in regards to taking care of their families. I don't believe that to be true.

My original point was that it's possible that women in executive positions might be more anxious and less happy than their male counterparts because in addition to their work, they usually also have to take care of their kids and home. Could the man do it? Sure he could. But he usually doesn't.

For example, this study claims that women do more housework than men, even when they earn more. 

> Despite their entry into paid employment, women still carry out more domestic work than men, limiting their ability to act on an equal footing within the workplace. [...] On average, men whose partners earn more than they do carry out more housework than other men, although women in these partnerships still do more. 

. 

> It was 22 women though, the men were basically just a control. At what point would you actually begin to question the study? 15 women, 10? 5?

Depends on the specific case obviously. And you can't just ignore the number of observations designated as controls. That's not how hypothesis testing works. If you want to compare two groups it very much matters how many observations there are in each group.

> Fair enough. Nevertheless, if they spent any time at a university I suspect that they have a high likelihood of having been conditioned to be hyper sensitive.

Ask a bunch of Germans in 1938 how they'd feel about attending a program with a bunch of Jews and you might get a similar response that these 22 students provided.

Completely agree. The point wasn't that it was a rational response.

I am actually convinced that Warner wasn't being racist. I said he should be punished if he was, which is really fair.

">Markets are not perfect and people make mistakes, but absent government created market failures, these imperfections will eliminate themselves over time.

No, no, no. Completely false. Provably completely false. Have you heard of Standard Oil or Bell Telephone? Standard Oil alone enjoyed nearly two decades of monopoly before the Federal government had to invent anti-trust legislation for the purpose of shutting it down. Monopolies, once established, are extremely difficult to dislodge through market action. Doing so requires an entity with even bigger pockets than the monopoly, which is a) unlikely because the monopoly enjoyed monopoly profits for so long, and b) ultimately pointless because the it's in the interests of the new entity to use below price sales to drive the old monopoly under and become a new monopoly. 

So no, market failures do not categorically self-correct with time. You've got this ideological blindness that makes you want to hand wave things in order to preserve plausible belief in the idea that absolute economic freedom can solve all of humanity's ills. You have to force yourself to examine and consider facts that shoot down your hypothesis.

>I don't justify authoritarian government, but thanks for assuming so.

I said that your argument has historically been used to advocate for authoritarian government. Subtle - but important - distinction. The unsavory history around an argument can be a warning of its undesirable policy recommendations.

>On the contrary, I point this out as a means to show that with more ""democracy"" comes more ""public interest,"" meaning everyone wants to make others do for them what they won't. You can call it ""unproven"" if you'd like to just ignore the history of the creation of the welfare state.

I was addressing your claim that ""...and the society becomes a tragedy of the commons where everyone has an incentive to find people who think like them in order to inflict onto others redistributive pain and to block those others from doing the same.""

I can see how this claim is very similar, but the counter examples differ. The idea with 'rise of the welfare state' complaints is generally that there are laws which allow people to choose to do nothing productive and be supported by other's taxes. If that's an inaccurate reflection of your concern, please do correct me. I'll go with it as I understand it for now.

So, in order for there to be a rise of a welfare state of the 'people choosing not to work and be supported by people who do' variety, there needs to be some state in which the laws make that possible, yes?

So, which state would that be? It's not the case in the U.S.; aid is all either time limited (meaning that a person can't use it forever and thereby live off of it), subject to participation in work seeking programs (meaning that it replaces the work avoided with other work, and therefore isn't desirable) or as a result of a form of public insurance. By the latter I mean things like disability or worker's compensation. 

There is no way to simply decide not to work in the U.S. or any other nation that I know of. Nor do I know of any mainstream political movement that advocates creating such a system. There is no welfare state, much less a 'rising' one.

What is common in other nations and often advocated are systems of public insurance. Unemployment insurance in the U.S. is an example. Everyone pays an insurance premium out of their payroll, and in exchange they can rely on a small and time-limited amount of income in the event of unemployment. Because it's a public program every can participate, and not just people with low risk of unemployment, and it's cheaper because there is no margin needed for things like profit and marketing. The United States has public disability insurance and old age insurance (called Social Security) that work similarly.

Other nations have public health insurance, less bare bones unemployment insurance, and some interesting things like education insurance, which covers the cost of education and retraining in the event that the latter is necessary for employment.

These are entirely reasonable public policies. Nobody can choose not to work for a living, because they're only useful if people actually do work. 

More abstractly, if there were a society where people decided to create some program that paid them for doing nothing, imagine the economics of it. The more people stopped working and took the free money, the fewer people would be contributing into the system and the lower the benefits would become as a result, and therefore less attractive to anyone considering not working. In other words, such a program could never attract or support much of the population, even if it offered open entrance to all. The 'people voting themselves the treasury' thing as it applies to creating welfare states isn't a real worry because a) Societies haven't actually ever done such a thing to date despite a considerable length of time in which to do so, and because b) Such a thing is an economic impossibility anyway.

>Regulatory capture is a certainty, and a direct result of the creation of regulation. Without regulation, there wouldn't be such an entrenched ""feudalism"" as you call it...Markets clear, it's the regulations which cause systemic problems.

There are in fact such things as market failures. Monopolies are an excellent example, as they are both well studied in the literature and have a long history. Unfettered markets can and do crash and burn. Regulation didn't create Standard Oil or it's devastatingly effective extortionate pricing; free market economic incentives did. It took the invention of anti-trust regulation to put an end to Standard Oil and create a competitive market once more.

If you're tired of hearing me talk about monopolies or want a more contemporary example, consider the housing derivatives market crash. No regulation forced the invention of derivatives, and indeed it is likely due to regulatory capture that an underlying instrument so hard to evaluate was allowed to exist at all. Nor did any regulation force private and institutional investors to pour staggering amounts of money into derivatives that couldn't be accurately priced or evaluated for risk. Nor did any regulation force people to buy the houses underlying those instruments when they couldn't afford them. Indeed, there were regulations that explicitly forbade the practice that were ignored, because forging income on loan documents was very easy and selling the resulting mortgage backed securities was so very profitable for the thousands of local banks issuing mortgages. Nor did regulation make it possible to create ballooning mortgages that virtually guaranteed the house's occupants wouldn't be able to pay several years down the line. In the absence of a regulation forbidding it, that was all the idea of the mortgage issuers, who didn't care if a mortgage defaulted after they sold it and got their profit.

Sometimes economic incentives create perverse behavior that's actually destructive, rather than being the productive sort of behavior that we generally associate with work. There's an economic incentive to sell something cheap while telling the buyer it's actually something else that's much more expensive. That's why we have laws against fraud. There's an economic incentive to steal things because the cost of acquiring them is very low. That's why we have laws against theft. It's the regulation of perverse economic incentives that aren't productive. Just like requiring people to only sell financial instruments that can be accurately evaluated to avoid fraud and pricing bubbles, or requiring banks to ensure that reported borrower income really does exist so that there aren't avoidable and expensive defaults. Without that regulation all the perverse incentives native to a completely free market come into play, and vast amounts of economic activity get diverted from productive work to more economically incentivized but useless behavior.

>Huh? Aristocracy is a product of government regulation limiting the numbers of people who can or cannot do business.

Government granted monopolies can create an aristocracy, that's true. That's not the sort of aristocracy I'm concerned about these days, though. I'm concerned about a few people acquiring so much wealth that they can run society unchallenged, creating a de facto aristocracy of plutocrats and a de facto serf class of everybody else, who have no way of catching up to the runaway wealth creation cycle enjoyed by wealthy few, and lose the power to right such societal problems because of government capture through the leveraging of wealth to that end.

">Do you even know what agency is? 

There are different definitions of the agency in philosophy. Perhaps if you explain which one you use we can have a more substantive conversation. 

>How is looking for additional mitigating circumstances, especially having to do with women's emotionality or mental state not denying agency? 

Again, this is dependent what definition one uses. If one goes with the most basic concept, which is the ability to act, acknowledging mitigating factors does not deny a person's agency. It would suggest rather that there were things that influenced the person's choices and those things should be considered when deciding punishment. 

>I mean, even MRAS AGREE WITH ME HERE.

The Good Men Project is a feminist organization.

>How does that contradict any of what I said, particularly the unattractive part?

You argued ""a female rapist gives something that's unwanted so it's perceived (by men) as less criminal"". That is much different than assuming the sex should be wanted. In that instance, the woman's actions are not considered wrong because from that perspective she did nothing wrong; it is the male who failed to act properly. Likewise, your statement does not acknowledge that people do not think unwanted sex from a woman is actually harmful. You do appear to argue that only men view the act as less criminal, which is clearly inaccurate. We know at least some women -- those who commit rape, for example -- may consider the act less criminal.

>In this case yes.

If you agree that women are victims even when they benefit from unfair advantages, then I fail to understand your negative reaction to me pointing this out. 

>Citation needed.

Pick one at your leisure.

>Really, because punishing girls for causing impure thoughts in boys and slut-shaming victims of sexual assault tells me otherwise.

It is possible to place unfair expectations two groups of people at the same time. 

>Explain me why are then female victims of male violence scrutinised and often handwaved as having ""deserved it"" or ""been asking for it""?

See the above comment. 

>If this was benevolent sexism men would also be barred from taking any position involving decision-making or evaluating people - you know, like women are on grounds of their hormones making them irrational and overemotional.

That is not how ""benevolent"" sexism against men supposedly works. What you describe would meet the feminist definition of ""hostile"" sexism. ""Benevolent"" sexism would be something that is technically positive, such as ""men are great leaders"".

>You've shown profound unawareness of what the theory even is and of even basic concepts like agency and privilege.

We have not discussed ""privilege"" and you did not give a definition of ""agency"", so there is no unawareness on my part unless you assume I should know your thoughts. 

>Disagreeing with an established theory involves examining its premises or conclusions and drawing data that supports your alternative hypothesis.

No, it does not. Disagreeing with a theory involves examining its hypothesis and determining the veracity of the methodology used to support the hypothesis, whether the methodology supports the conclusion, and whether the conclusion matches the hypothesis. One need not provide a counter theory. 

If one were to apply your logic to another theory, say religion, you are arguing that an atheist must provide a counter explanation to the theories presented by a given religion. 

>For example if benevolent sexism were in fact female privilege you would have to show that 1) it grants women social influence and is used to 2) keep them them in power and 3) deny it to non-women.

In other words, I would need to show that women who commit rape can exploit people's presumptions in order to receive lesser sentences, use those presumptions to maintain their their current status, and show that males cannot exploit the same presumptions? Are you certain I cannot do this?

Not only that, but to be able to process hundred of thousands of humans DNA(Maybe millions!), compared with their lifetime achievements, singling out which achievements(Remember, every human have several achievements in their lifetime!) are gained by intelligence, calculating simple statistics over the literally, billions of billions of genes spread across the hundred of thousands humans. In order to find some correlating evidence that gene xyz might cause higher level of intelligence. That's all.

When we finally create a machine with equal intelligence to that of a human, copying it won't make it easier to figure out how to improve it. The more we learn the more questions. In order to improve a highly effective machine, we need to get a better grasp of the technology and science involved. Sometimes we need to look at something completely different(To get the good 'ol Eurka moment). Doing so is a daunting task. Even for the smartest human.

I understand your points but you have to realize that your personal bias to this is keeping you from a proper structure. Like I said before, I like the setup and presentation, in fact everything about it - including production - is all very well done. The biggest problem is simply how the video struggles to convey information effectively. 

Here's a test for you: remove every bit of your comedy relief out of the video (including interactions between the two) and see what you have left. It should flow fairly well and the information should seem smoothly delivered. Think of the comedy as a parenthesis in a sentence. If it doesn't work when the comedy is removed then you have a problem. It's also a problem if your 9 something minute long video becomes only 3 minutes. 

I have a suggestion for your structure that I think would work pretty well. You have to break your video up into separate parts, similar to paragraphs. First you should introduce the subject at hand. Next you can bring in some light comedy. Then get into the meat of the information. If you have any back and forth here make sure it's either mot occurring when information is being rolled out or just keep it very short and contained. Actually, keep it short and contained anyways. Finally go into your closing. Feel free to go nuts here. Now do the test I talked about above and you'll see a dramatic improvement to quality because literally all that is left at that point is unbroken information. 

Go out and watch some other reviewers/reporters. For example, dirty bomb does something somewhat similar so check out how they do it. Maybe a 'quick look' format would better suite you with the back and forth comedy than a straight up info dump. 

I'm really not trying to be mean. I'm just trying to tell you how it is without sugar coating it. I truly believe channels like this are currently lacking and I'm only saying something because I care. With enough introspection you'll be able to remedy this and put out some high quality and engaging videos.

If you like this game, then there is NO WAY you played the original mass effect games. 


This game is all over the place garbage. And I am not going to discuss bugs or animations. First, the character. The Ryders are incredibly boring. They look young, you can't customize them. You can't customize your background. In fact, the game has managed to take a STEP BACK from previous installments in customization. I was upset when you could not make your player from Earth, or poor or whatever. I liked how in ME you could make your character a lone survivor or a war hero. Hell, there were even side missions about this. Here, when you click on history, the big choice is if Shepard was male or female. Instead, BioWare wrote the whole story for you and all you did was get to make a face. I also hated the main character because they did not look cool or act like a leader. She/He acts like a 25 year old kid. They should have let you really flesh our the background of your character. Make a N7 guy or a scientist biotic. The series was known for player choice and interaction in a galexy, this game makes it clear they are not going for that anymore


The gameplay. If you think the gameplay is ""unique"" a ""step forward"" than you are absolutely retarded. The profiles was a dumb addition. They stripped all the powers away to usher in this craptastic watered down system that does nothing for the player. I can't be the full on military guy or master biotic. I can't use all my powers of Tech at once. The game forces me to change on the fly and swap around. Which sounds nice in theory but works horribly. I don't want to use 3 powers at once. 


the planets. While the game said it focused on exploration....it forces the player to not explore. There is zero point of exploring planets. The long vieos of traveling to a system, to a planet, leaving a planet, landing on a planet. Jesus christ. You enter the system, find an anomly, land on the golden planet. Another other planet added to the system was just clutter.


The crafting. Its so crap. Just menus after menus after menus. Got to research a weapon. After scanning. Do not get me started on scanning. Then you got to farm and farm and farm. 


The last point I will hit here is dialogue. The last installments made me want to watch the dialogue because there was a chance for paragon and renegade points.

">Your character's power there isn't ""gives you an uncontrollable craving for snack cakes."" Or rather if it is and that's all we know about it, it's unusable in a battleboard because its mechanics are undefined.

This is the kind of thing that keeps getting you in trouble: We don't need the mechanics to be defined. The power does what it does. 

This entire idea you have of the mechanics of powers being defined is a delusion. Some powers have more or fewer rules that we know they run by, but we have no common fundamental laws that all fictional universes run on to be saying exactly how power X will interact with power Y from two different settings.

Hell, we don't even have those for real life. Even physics is derived from empirical observation and inductive reasoning, not derivation from known principles, and even though all other branches of science theoretically reduce down to phsyics, the interactions and nuances are so complex that we can rarely work them out from there, leaving us to determine things about, say, the behavior patterns of rats from actually observing rats.

So, no, we'll do the exact same thing with the Hostess power as we will with every other power, including punching: we'll determine what it's capable of based on its observable effects. 

>Only an idiot would say that an omnipotent would be vulnerable to anything that wasn't another omnipotent,

>But the point is that even if they are unaffected by hax of any kind it isn't just because they are generically ""strong."" They are ""immune"" because they can unmake the user with less than a thought, rewrite the part of themselves that the hax would be exploiting, rewrite the hax itself, or literally anything else because they are a frickin' omnipotent.

And now you're trying to sidestep the issue by focusing on offensive action by the LT (who isn't actually omnipotent) instead of actual resistance. 

> If I come at your character with an attack, the burden of proof is on you to show that it won't work. If you present to me a defense, then the burden shifts to me to show that they attack could overcome it.

This is blatantly self-contradictory nonsense that, if taken seriously, would mean that whether the attack or defense prevails depends entirely on which debater speaks first. Or- let's be honest- is going to come down to you always insisting that the burden of proof is on the other person.

The only reasonable thing to do is to assume neither as true by default, and demand that the evidence for either position is presented and evaluated. This is how things work in the real world: burden of proof is only automatically assigned when one side is making a positive claim (""Bigfoot exists""). When asking an open question about how two complex processes will interact, there is no position that gets to claim to be true until disproved.

>Is a gag character. If you want to be taken seriously, I wouldn't bother bringing him up. 

You're the last person here who needs to be giving out advice about what to do to be taken seriously. Saitama is a character, just like any other, and not only is OPM not any less logically consistent than any other series, but it's actually more consistent than a lot of series.

>Unless your brain chemicals or synapses themselves have feats for not being susceptible to telekinesis, then they're getting moved around. A speed blitz before they can activate their power is an option, but not much else.

This is not me splitting hairs. Non-human brain chemistry isn't a special case. It's part of the general principle that you want to ignore: A power has to have feats showing that it can affect the kinds of characters you claim it will affect.

>Yet again, it doesn't matter at all how generically powerful you are if you possess a quality that the hax works against. If they are shown to have human physiology,

They've shown the exact opposite. They've showing that they have abilities that are not compatible with normal human physiology. 

>Goku could bust a planet by the end of the Namek saga; Freiza still almost drowned him because his saiyan physiology still required air to reach his brain for it to function. 

Goku's need for air is explicitly established. Him being physiologically normal in other way isn't. Goku has also drunken the super-holy water, a poison that killed everyone else that had tried to drink it before him, and survived. There's that ""evidence"" thing rearing its ugly head again. He's not just ""human, but with energy beams"". 

And then you go and ignore how ""induced suffocation"" might actually function to just assume that it would work on him. Goku can be suffocated if you can deny him access to air. If your power works by paralyzing his lungs, then you have to demonstrate that you can actually do that to him. And we could get really, really weird here by pointing out that DB character's lung capacities often exceed what should be possible just from creating a vacuum by expanding their diaphragms (ie, screaming so loud that they break dimensional barriers or blowing rocks at people hard enough to break their bones), indicating that even a power that worked by drawing the air out of their lungs might not be effective, since they apparently have some kind of super-breathing powers.

For someone who says that ""The Devil is in the Details"", you have a very adversarial relationship with the details.

>Yes, I'm very familiar with required secondary powers. They're are assumptions we make because it makes sense to us given what we see of the characters and what does and doesn't happen from using their primary powers. For your specific example, that can be a decent argument against that specific type of that kind of use of TK. Still means squat against the other two, or the multitude of other methods to apply a similar effect.

You keep doing this thing where you admit that you're wrong when having your logic applied to a specific example, without every imagining that maybe your logic is flawed if I can keep finding counterexamples so easily.

You even do it so blindly that you failed to notice that the example i give would also work against the first kind of TK since it's based in physical force, and moving fast through muscle power requires creating physical force.

>If antimagic field works by cutting off the connections between a source of power and its wielder, then they very well might work on allomancers.

Look, you keep telling me that I don't understand things, then immediately proceeding to demonstrate that you completely fail to grasp the underlying principles I'm demonstrating to you.

No matter how anti-magic field works, it has to have some basis on which to interact with an allomancer. There has to be some kind of common metaphysical principle between the two, and there's no way that said principle can ever be proven to exist. Even the applying of force to molecules requires that the molecules be subject to whatever metaphysics allows the power to apply force to them.

The interaction between powers from two different universes is always an assumption.

>Or you could do what we do with every other kind of defense and base if off of what it's actually shown to be effective against.

Cubelock is the strongest deck in both standard and wild. The deck is overpowered. Getting rid of Voidlord/Mal'Ganis and substituting it with Dreadlord will not butcher the deck, it will simply make it somewhat fair.

"Is the buzzword usage of those terms supposed to make a point for you? If someone mislabels you with a buzzword that they don't fully understand, it's very easy to correct them. Such occurrences are a simple consequence of people being more vocal about these issues, you can expect some misdirected overflow. But many frustrated kids, and even adults, don't have the basic critical thinking skills to deal with that. And that frustration leads to pejoratives like ""SJW"", providing a lazy characterization to preemptively discredit conflicting views, while protecting actual bigots (those with irrational negative interpretations of others).

">I'm not sure I agree. That ability might have been useful for the last Featured Episode (the General Vosk fight). I found that fight quite challenging on some of my less-played alts. Reducing damage by temporarily removing an enemy from the fight every 30 seconds is, after all, just another crowd control tool.

Replicator->Small Hypo

You should have enough to replicate that even on less player alts.

Reducing damage is one thing, having an enemy teleport out of weapons range is another. It is a crowd control tool, however, it brings out more issues than potential benefits.

>If they wanted to improve the ability, they could have it so it won't affect any enemy you currently have targeted. That would reduce the potential downside (having an enemy you're shooting at teleported out of range) while still providing the defensive/crowd control benefit (such as it is).

No. Remove it. I don't think you understand the issue here. Have you ever played DRSE? No? Well, then, let me tell you - Elachi are already a pain in the arse to find on that map, if they start walking around from their set locations (after they take damage from a pet or a really bad player that can't kill them fast), and you have to kill them all in under 3 minutes if you want it not to fail.

Not only that, this could be a very annoying issue for ground queues like Bug Hunt, Assault on Terok Nor, even Brotherhood of the Sword, Undine Infiltration and even NTTE.

It is introducing an unnecessary element of confusion for your teammates, it can teleport enemies way form mines and AOE attacks and introduces a potential issue of enemies teleporting out of bounds of the map or behind a wall, or an inaccessible section.

"Yeah, sorry, New Vegas fits the bill completely. Same as 3 and 4, it's more of an expansion to 3 than a new game.

New Vegas does not have a final boss. Not sure what you're talking about. The different factions you pick largely want you to exterminate the others. Almost all of New Vegas is spent in combat, dialogue is minimal compared to combat. 

Strange that you'd bring up a game that proves my point. Fallout: New Vegas is not on any level, in any way shape or form, even remotely a game in the same vein as FO1 or 2. It is, however, exactly in the same vein as Fallout 3 and 4. 

Weird that you'd bring up the Powder Gangers, I'd say that's a failure of the game because it's something you see at the beginning of the game and then never again. Just completely abandoned. 

Fallout 4 is a radical improvement over New Vegas, anyway. New Vegas has poor gameplay balance, a boring world to explore, boring loot, a janky hardcore mode that doesn't even remotely make the game more challenging or immersive, etc. 

I think what's clear here is that you aren't really a gamer, you're not in it for gaming mechanics. We'll never see eye to eye. I play games because I love games. You, however, would be better off reading choose your own adventure books. Try Telltale games. They are minimal on gaming, heavy on dialogue choices, right up your alley. You should avoid RPGs and focus on adventure games."
"I think some people in their reply will sort of toe around the subject, but I'm going to respect you enough not to do this. Are people going to downvote you for having the ""wrong"" opinion? Yes, because that is internet culture. Did you miss something in your first read of the book? Clearly, but it was you first read, and I don't think starting comics ""two months ago"" could in any way equate to you reading ""quite a lot."" Should you go to another Superman book and give him another shot? No, absolutely not. You should go back and read this again with more analytical eyes.

If you never thought Superman was in danger throughout the entire story, you missed a very crucial element of the book. He is, in fact, in ""danger"" throughout the entire thing - his death is on the table from the moment the book begins with his birth. What follows is the equivalent of the Hero's Journey or Hercules' Twelve Labors, in that Superman is given so many tasks to complete before he is unable to help humanity anymore, all of which are life-threatening labors (both his and others), as well as figuring out his appropriate legacy at the same time. It's the ultimate story of an alien being more human than your average person, and it's a perfect example of just why Superman and Lex Luthor make such dynamic foils. It's heartbreaking, it's beautiful, it's an ode to comics and the epitome of hope supreme, and it is one of the best comics I've ever read in my entire life -- one I re-read frequently and one I keep close to my heart as my comic book version of a bible.

If you want my advice, I wouldn't move on to another Superman book. Not yet, anyway. Perhaps you weren't ""ready"" to tackle All Star yet and that's how clearly missed ""the point"", but if I can give this book to my ten year old nephew and have him come back to me starry eyed and turn him into a lifelong Superman fan, I don't see any excuse about how you can't ""get it"". 

So if you want my honest recommendation, as both a discerning comic reader and part-time Superman fanboy, I would go back and read All Star very slowly. Take the time to really sink your eyes into Frank Quitely's gorgeous art, and discover his ability to bestow a distinct veil of humanity over someone who is anything but. Take some time to really appreciate the way Morrison weaves the threads of the story together until their culmination, all of the little details hidden in lines of dialogue that aren't ostensibly apparent on your first read (there's a killer line in issue #2 with a wonderful pay-off in #12, if memory serves). You're not going to find a better Superman story because there isn't one; no story, no matter how much danger he is put in or whatever, captures all the best qualities of both Superman the character and Superman the idea/ideal. Every other recommendation pales in comparison. 

My final comment might come off a bit rude, but if all you want is a book that is like ""every other comic"", then that's a bad place to be in to truly discover what is great about comics. You're new, and in today's day there are so many wonderful books out there that pigeon-holing what you consume is borderline idiotic. It's really not about people punching each other or threatening to blow up the world daily, and I would hope that having claimed to read Maus or Y you'd understand that. Otherwise you're essentially allowing yourself to be wooed by mediocrity.

tl;dr Read it again."

This dude is nothing but one public front, and once Arrow ends I have a feeling that everyone will realize it. I was enamored by him too at some point, but it's become increasingly clear that he's only using Arrow as an ends to a means at the moment. While Grant clearly loves the job he has, pitches story ideas, reads comics based on the character he's playing, actively discusses The Flash as a hero of the comics and actively realizes his take on the character wouldn't exist without the comic lore, Stephen uses his Arrow fame to promote movies, his fan projects, his T-Shirts, and his need to play other roles. He actively lets cast members get bullied (not that he NEEDS to say anything about that, it's not his job, but when he's one of two figureheads of the fandom bullying said cast members, you'd think he'd make more than a passing comment), but also lets his wife (and I personally think he does need to say something) get bullied, belittled, and abused by the ""Arrow fans"". I don't think he's ever read a comic in his life, I don't think he cares much about anything outside of the paycheck he gets (whereas Grant, Carlos, Katie, etc. clearly loved the characters they were/are playing) and I just don't think he's as stand up of a guy as people think. Not that set reports are to be completely believed but I've heard from numerous people about his attitude(s) on set, his disagreements on set (with people like Katie and Colton), etc.

"Alright, let's talk about science, because that's my specialty anyway. Men who have sex with women are objectively bad at accurately labeling sexual assault, and get confused by such things as how attractive they imagine the woman to be, and how excited she sounds about being walked home. These men fail to accurately label sexual assault as assault even when the victim gives a clear and unflowery ""no"" with no sugar-coating at all. 

In addition, men work to attribute responsibility for rape to women, while simultaneously reducing the accountability attributable to men by claiming to ""not understand"" women's refusals, which are given the same way any other refusal is given in social contexts, and when, in fact, they not only understand, but admit that they would communicate sexual rejection in the same way. More blunt rejections are generally considered rude, and rude/insulting behavior is more likely to invite violence. 

In one study, men read a scenario in which a modestly dressed woman said “no” to her date‘s sexual advances three times and tried to move away. When the men were asked to rate how much the woman wanted to have sexual intercourse, their average rating was 4.5 on a scale of 1 to 9. Think about what that means for a second. 

It's also a common tactic for rapists to reassure their victim during an assault (as Aziz was reported to have done). Women who are sexually assaulted by an acquaintance are less likely to be believed. (Ask yourself if you're falling prey to this common bias.)

The probability of a woman being injured during an assault is lowest when she engages in arguing rather than physical resistance, which ""Grace"" did ad nauseam in her account of her date with Aziz (a smart thing to do if her goal was to reduce personal injury, but a counterproductive thing to do if her goal was to increase her chance of getting a conviction.

By their own admission, between 10.5%-57% of men have engaged in behaviors that qualify as sexual assault, and most of those are committed against a casual date (just don't use the label ""sexual assault"" on the survey, though, or you will get a lower response rate, because sex offenders who go after acquaintances convince themselves they are performing seduction, not assault). 

Aziz has at least one risk factor for sexual assault perpetration in that he was engaging in promiscuous sex on a first date with a woman he just met (because remember, on this they both agree). 

So, even before he's accused, it's not far-fetched that he's committed sexual assault (remember, 10.5%-57% of men self-report behaviors that qualify, there's a tendency to under-report even when surveys don't use the give-away labels, and he's got at least one risk factor for perpetration. Given that false accusations are rare, and we know he was on a date with the accused and that it was sexual, he's already reached the preponderance of evidence standard that's required for civil court conviction. 

But we shouldn't stop there. We should discuss that men (like you?) have a greater tendency to treat unreported sex crimes as made-up lies, despite the fact that victims are likely to be re-traumatized by the institutions to which they would report, and most victims choose not to report in part because the conviction rate is so abysmally low, but also out of fear of retaliation or some other reason. 

This difficulty in convicting likely leads to higher rates of sexual violence because perpetrators know they are likely to get away with it.


But perhaps more to the point, you misunderstand the anecdotal evidence fallacy and the appeal to authority fallacy. The law is written to apply to everyone equally, so if I know from my own legal case that it's illegal to grope someone who has issued even a polite rejection, it's illegal to grope someone who has issued a polite rejection. That doesn't necessarily mean there will be sufficient evidence to convict, as there rarely is, but there are text record messages in both cases that the accused admitted to sexual activity that he claims to have ""misread"" that the accuser found nonconsensual. In some states, at least, that would explicitly be sufficient.

"First off the porn community is people who watch porn. You don’t talk about porn with people who don’t watch it because it makes you weird as fuck. So yeah, going to strangers and saying someone you know was in a porno is pretty insensitive and seems like intent to hurt. 

Pornography isn’t produced for public consumption in public. That’s the point. It’s for public consumption while in private. 

Talking about them is completely natural... but not when you’re talking about a specific person you know... and I remind you not talking to the person herself, but instead the FEW friends she had was deliberately trying to cause harm. Even if she did tell someone it’s not okay for them to tell everyone else. You’ve honestly NEVER told a secret? 



And who are you people?
1) I’m just one person saying it’s not okay to put someone’s business on display. Sure she did it, but the other guy IS JUST AS MUCH IF NOT MORE at fault for exposing it to her only support group, taking it away from her.

3) treating women like the grown human they are doesn’t mean you have to put their dirty laundry on display. Being a grown human means having compassion and maybe letting information that could hurt someone’s feelings slide by the wayside. 

4) You seem like you had a very harsh upbringing, maybe you feel like you were held accountable for every mistake so you think it’s only fair if everyone else is held accountable for theirs, but you need to forgive and be nicer to people. Because you come off like an ass. I honestly don’t even know why you call out women specifically. It sounds like you mean to say we should treat grown humans like adults, but you specify women in that general statement.

"> QFT is as deep a level of reality as you need to describe everything that is happening in your brain.

No. You know what's funny, this all goes back to my very first post. 

But, before we review, let's just point out again that you are messily and dishonestly overlapping drastically different truth statements. The obvious one, the one you cling to and quote and worship, is the statement ""we know everything there is to know about atoms."" You then go from that statement to say that ""we know everything there is to know about [brains].""

Lets say that we know everything there is to know about cells.
 
Can we say that, ""because we know everything there is to know about cells,"" then we know everything there is to know about beings made of cells?

If in your opinion we can say the first one, but not the second, then why not?

It's a seductive belief to latch on to. It's very comfortable, to be able to sit in your computer chair and declare that because you know everything about atoms, that you know everything there is to know about existence. One day, kid, you're going to wake up. For real. I hope you learn to see that conceptual arrogance you hold close to yourself for what it is, a parasite designed to destroy your connection with wisdom and truth.

Okay. So that was the first reason your logic was wrong. In sum,


1) Both atoms and QFT, though relatively small and seductive to someone who seeks the power to make sweeping universal statements, are undeniably and arbitrarily holistic and cannot be invoked to make universal statements for the same basic reason any other undeniable, arbitrarily holistic level cannot encompass everything that is possible. It only works -- the ability to make logically valid sweeping univeral statements -- if you've found the ground floor of this reductionist pyramid ad infinitum (which doesn't even really exist, btw). And you haven't yet, and all signs point to finding the ""bottom"" of this reality as being utterly impossible.

The second reason! You believe and your argument completely depends on the belief that causation only runs one way. This is incorrect because causation in the universe is undeniably recursive. We live in a recursive universe. High levels influence arrangements of low levels and, obviously, low levels influence arrangements of high levels.

A quote from my old post:

>The key take-away for you, or anyone who is interested in awakening, I think, on this second point, is not that reality has a one-way causality (either bottom-up or top-down), or even that reality has a two-way causality (both bottom-up and top-down). The key point is that reality is uncreated, one, unbroken, and perfectly whole. Being uncreated, it is outside causality. Being complete, nothing can exist outside it to be caused. Being one, there is nothing that can cause another thing. Being perfect and equal everywhere, there is no level that is more important or fundamental than any other level. Any attempt to divide reality into ""lower"" levels and ""higher"" levels is an analytical artifice that will quickly result in paradox. The problem only arises when you start thinking that concepts, those useful illusions of separation conjured by the analytical mind, are actually real.

And, the third reason your reasoning is wrong is because your logical leap depends on the unproven belief and assumption that computational irreducibility doesn't exist. In other words, in order to logically prove your point, you still need to assume that given initial ""boundary conditions,"" there is nothing we cannot predict about the end result. As I showed, this is untrue for even simple programs, let alone 100,000,000,000 neurons in the brain.

"So you want a citation for whether people have a hard wired sense of ethics? There are sooo many ways to tackle it. Yes, what is the empirical evidence for an innate sense of ethics and a tendency toward the golden rule and altruism? 

Can I turn to case studies or prospective studies on children or adults to demonstrate ethics have an evolutionary basis? Yes.

Can I turn to experts and consensus opinions that state we are all ""endowed from birth"" with a conscience and moral sense? Yes

Can I turn to neuroscience and identify structures which have evolved in our brains to regulate our moral conduct? Yes.

Can I turn to history to show an ancient recognition of this inbuilt moral nature? Yes!


My contention that people come pre-equipped with a ""moral compass"" is born out in this 2005 article on health and aging published in the Gerontology Society of America by William Michael Brown: 
From the abstract: ""As expected, levels of social support given were associated with lower morbidity, whereas levels of receiving were not. It is important that these relations held even when (a) socioeconomic status, education, marital status, age, gender, ethnicity, and (b) absolute network size and activity limitation were controlled for. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for theory regarding the relations among social exchanges, giving, and later life adaptation among older adults. "" - http 

So our ability to be efficient in our maintenance of wisdom/skills and to survive as a group and as a species is enhanced by our bestowing of care onto others. If you believe in Darwinian natural selection and you accept the conclusions from the cited study (above) then you must also accept the inference from this example of altruism in action. Ethical behavior does play a positive role in group survival and, therefore, in the ability to pass on genes. Do you follow?

What about children? Are they gifted with a growing innate sense of ethics and conscience? Researcher in childhood development have come to assume this to be the case. From the Journal Child Development, December 1991, comes a study by Grazyna Kochanska (University of Iowa):

""Toddlerhood antecedents of conscience were examined in 58 8–10-year-old children. The measures of conscience, such as general affective/moral orientation, the extent of reparation, and the intensity of guilt feelings, were assessed from children's narratives produced in response to semiprojective stories involving transgressions, distress, and conflict. Maternal endorsed socialization orientations and observed rearing behaviors that deemphasized the use of power were associated with the children's internalized conscience 6 years later. However, these findings were significant only for children who were relatively prone to fearful arousal. The capacity for self-regulation, indexed by early compliance and noncompliance to maternal socialization, predicted children's internalized conscience 6 years later. There was preliminary evidence that compliance obtained in a rearing context that deemphasized power assertion was most conducive to the development of conscience. The findings are discussed in view of the interplay of socialization and temperament in moral development.""

Children have a measurable and identifiable ethical nature! How about that?

Now, I can also defer to ""expert"" opinion. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights"": 

""Article 1. All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.""
- http 

So, sovereignwill, the UN consensus comports with my statement that ethics are innate. We are born with a conscience.

But where better to describe the innateness of ethics than to pinpoint evolved structures of the brain? Can we destroy parts of the brain and turn a person from the path of morals/ethics? Yes.

""The present results indicate that brain regions associated with abstract reasoning and cognitive control (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) are recruited to resolve difficult personal moral dilemmas in which utilitarian values require ""personal"" moral violations, violations that have previously been associated with increased activity in emotion-related brain regions. Several regions of frontal and parietal cortex predict intertrial differences in moral judgment behavior, exhibiting greater activity for utilitarian judgments. We speculate that the controversy surrounding utilitarian moral philosophy reflects an underlying tension between competing subsystems in the brain.""

-Greene, J. D., Nystrom, L. E., Engell, A. D., Darley, J. M. & Cohen, J. D. The neural bases of cognitive conflict and control in moral judgment. Neuron 2004; 44, 389–400.

And then we have a timeline in history that tells us that the Golden Rule was not just fabricated yesterday or just in one geographic location:

""Adept Kung asked: ""Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?"" The Master replied: ""How about 'shu': never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself?"" "" - Confucian Analects XV.24, tr. (500 BCE) David Hinton

""“Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself.”

This was one of the guiding principles of life that Confucius taught his followers, five centuries before Jesus taught the Golden Rule with similar words. ""

Do not do to others that which angers you when they do it to you.1 Practice nothing in your deeds for which you condemn others in your words.

No goalposts were moved. You claimed that vegan meals at restaurants are more expensive than non-vegan meals, and that is not true. When you actually compare apples to apples (i.e. vegan and non-vegan meals at the same restaurant), vegan meals are cheaper or the same price.

>And how do those restaurants stack up price wise with cheap fast food places? You know, the places the poorer parts of the country eat.

I don't go to any of those except Subway, so I can't comment on them. At Subway in my country (Canada), the vegan option (veggie delite) is at the cheapest price level. If you add avocado or a veggie patty, it's still cheaper than some of the premium meat ones.

>Spoken like someone who's never been poor. Do you understand how much it would cost to achieve the raw caloric intake that the $1 burger at McDonald's would give you if you made it yourself?

>So go ahead and explain to me how you can, for less than $35 a week, spending no more than an hour and forty five minutes TOTAL on shopping and cooking for the entire week combined,

I personally spend less than $250 (Canadian) per month for groceries for two people. We do most of our cooking on the weekend, usually cooking two similar meals at the same time at lunchtime and dinnertime, and then heat up leftovers during the week for lunch at work and dinner after work.

So it doesn't take that long at all. About 3 hours during the weekend, and maybe an hour or two per week shopping.

Or...you could just eat five $1 McDonald's burgers a day (which don't actually exist in Canada).

"Your argument is extremely flawed and it only seems to be popular because it's longer than the average post. In it, you came to the conclusion that everyone who supports the bill is racist.

You came to this conclusion because you argue the sole reason UKIP want to ban this practice is because Pakistani people disproportionately engage in it. So if you're arguing that, you have to prove that UKIP only want to ban this because of the cultural group that do it.

And in your argument for this you've provided very sketchy reasoning and no evidence for that claim, which should be pointed out.

>You might initially imagine the reason for this bill was something to do with genetic disorder prevalence associated with first cousin marriage

This is the, in your eyes, ""non-racist"" argument for banning first cousin marriage. It's the argument that /u/GeoSmith16 and others are arguing in this debate, and it's the argument which people naturally assume is the rationale behind this legislation.

>it turns out that first cousin births give a similar defect rate (roughly 2% higher than the general population) to a woman giving birth at the age of 41. So, biologically speaking, there's nothing really wrong with first cousin birth

I see two lines of reasoning you've gone down by saying this, the first one deals with trying to expose UKIP for the racist party they are, and the second is to argue that first cousin marriage is biologically fine. Both of these intertwined arguments you make are totally flawed in many ways.

1. GeoSmith16 believes that first cousin marriage is not biologically okay. You believe it is. Your reasoning for GeoSmith and UKIP being racist here is that the only reason they oppose first cousin marriage is due to cultural connotations. What you've had to do is take your own opinion that first cousin marriage is biologically okay and apply it to everyone who disagrees.

In other words, you think your belief that first cousin marriage is biologically acceptable is so right that everyone who disagrees with you must know this. It's not even up for debate, you think, it is settled. It is reasonable that you believe first cousin marriage is biologically sound, but in order to argue that UKIP are being RACIST here you have to assume they secretly agree with you on that and are using the biological case as a facade in order to ban something to satisfy their concealed cultural prejudice.

And this is very stupid. You really should have saved your ""THAT'S RACIST"" ammunition, which you're scared to use because we always hold you to account for it, for another battle in the name of social justice against conservative opinion.

Just because you think first cousin marriage is biologically acceptable (for flawed reasons which I will move onto after this) does not mean GeoSmith, and UKIP, also think it. Isn't it ""projecting"" to think that an opinion you hold strongly must also be held by other people deep down? Your argument that UKIP are being racist relies on this, because if they are arguing for this bill on purely biological grounds (which they so far are, in what they have said in this debate) then they aren't arguing for it on cultural grounds.

This reasoning also relies on another fallacy, that there are only two possible cases for banning first cousin marriage: the biological case and the RACIST case. Although UKIP are so far arguing the former, you've concluded they can't be because it's wrong and therefore must really be doing this because they're racists.

2. First cousin marriage is biologically sound because first cousin births ""give a similar defect rate to a woman giving birth at the age of 41.""

I'm afraid this reasoning is also flawed. Now before I start, I don't know anything about this subject and nor do I particularly care, I just think the desperation you exhibit to brand UKIP racist is so intense that it leaves behind a trail of fallacious, laughable reasoning which someone has to clean up. That someone has to be myself today because poor old GeoSmith is so preoccupied arguing a case he doesn't really believe in, due to the fact he's secretly racist and wants to gas inbred Pakistani babies, that he can't defend himself against this complete drivel.

>it turns out that first cousin births give a similar defect rate (roughly 2% higher than the general population) to a woman giving birth at the age of 41. So, biologically speaking, there's nothing really wrong with first cousin birth

This is a whataboutism at best. But that's not the only crisis going on in this argument.

So in that argument you already admit first cousin births give a defect rate of 2% higher than the general population. But then you add ""But so do women above the age of 41, so that's fine."" It doesn't make first cousin birth and its defect rate any better, Cock. And nor does it mean people who are concerned about the high defect rate among first cousin births can't also simultaneously be concerned about the same phenomenon among births from women above 41. But how can you realise this when you're busy trying to say that UKIP think the only birth defect that most first cousin births produce is that they aren't white?"

Wikipedia notes that

>Parmigiano is also particularly high in glutamate, containing as much as 1.2 g of glutamate per 100 g of cheese, making it the naturally produced food with the second highest level of glutamate, after Roquefort cheese. The high concentration of glutamate explains the strong umami taste of Parmigiano.

>That's just your opinion

I think it's an opinion pretty well supported by evidence.

1) nobody sees the UFOs but the main characters and the player 
2) the only tangible thing the mural leads to after 4 years is the UFOs 

But, I'm perfectly happy to entertain something else if it makes sense. Lay it on me.

>It could have been related to something that was eventually cut, it could just be a clue to the Chiliad UFO and nothing else, or it could just be an artistic expression of the path to enlightenment. I don't know, but I enjoy hearing theories about it.

Me too. If they're good.

>Not sure how the addition of a random online easter egg would support or debunk this theory. Also, there was no ""discovery of cut content,"" you're referring to an alleged document from 2012. Even if that document is real, it just lends more credibility to the fact that the mural was related to cut content and not a treasure map to the UFO's.

No, it lends credibility to the possibility that the mural was once supposed to refer to a bigger deal than the UFOs, and they left it in the game to refer to just the UFOs. Which leaves us with ""the mural is just about the UFOs"".

>>The mural has 5 Xs that lead to the glyphs, and a big red eye on top of the mural that is in the position the Chiliad UFO shows up in, right above the platform that has the same eye underneath it. It's clearly related to the UFO sighting and telling you how to witness it.
>
>I agree, but that doesn't explain the other symbols at the bottom

They are hints to the locations of the other UFOs. The UFO is seen on top of the car at the hippie camp, the egg is seen at Paleto Bay, and the jetpack is supposed to lead GTA:SA players to this game's version of Area 69. At each one of those, there is a secondary UFO close by.

>Well a similar conclusion for both of them would be that they were only meant as set pieces, and not as cryptic easter eggs.

I agree that would be possible, except, as I said, the mural leads to a tangible result. The hamburger sign doesn't (yet).

>I personally don't think either of these are solved, I just don't see how you can decide on a ""logical"" conclusion for one and not the other.

Because the mural clearly points to a UFO hovering above the mountain, and there is a giant UFO in the game hovering above the mountain, right next to the mural. That's a pretty big Exhibit A.

>Since many people have tried to decode the Famous Hamburger sign, the ""logical"" conclusion is that it means nothing.

Agreed, it might mean nothing. But, it definitely looks like a code so I think it's reasonable to think it means something (even if the ""something"" is dumb, like an inside joke from a dev telling his friend Jeff Figo to go fuck himself).

I also agree it might mean nothing, but I think that's unlikely.

"It may seem odd, and I can understand how it may look to someone who isn't really into props/costuming. My first career was as a make-up FX/prop artist for TV and Film, and I have probably worked on many of the movies and TV you've seen. So, for someone like me, these ""odd"" details are very important. 

I never said I was against going to a metalworking shop to have it welded. I am just trying to create a pattern that best represents the original, and then leaving it in the hands of those fans that attempt to create it to use whatever they have at their disposal. 

I will personally not use JB weld on this project, and have contacted a local metal worker about doing the welds for me. 

But that is really beside the point. I may be overstating the importance of bend deduction and such, but that is because I am trying to learn for the sake of knowing, and because I want to know if it will have any effect on my final design.

Sure, I could just wing it, and cut out five different pieces of metal and figure out what works, but I kind of figured I would first consult experts in metal work, in the hopes that they would be able to use their experience to save me hours of trial and error, and wasted materials. 

As for how I can take measurements that accurate. There are tricks that prop designers use to reference different parts of the costume. Then using reference, math, and experience, and often times various sources/angles/references, come up with is often quite accurate. 

For example, there was a prop from Indiana Jones that had been recreated over a span of 20 years or so by keen-eyed fans, using nothing but screen grabs, and reference photos. Years later someone was given unrestricted access to the original, and it turned out the fans were as close to 100% accurate as anyone could be. 

All that said...

If making test pieces is what needs to be done, then that is what need to be done. It is what I would have most likely done back when I was working in the FX shop. I suppose I was just hoping that a lot of time and materials could be saved by first looking at this from a theoretical perspective, then applying it. 

Like, if someone came to me and said, ""I am attempting to sculpt a zombie mask to re-create this character in The Walking Dead TV show, and I don't know which is the best tool for making wrinkles.""

I have a lot of experience in that, so instead of saying, ""You're just going to have to experiment, because..."" I can actually say, ""You're going to need to first try using a number 2, loop tool, and then lay down plastic wrap, and go over it with the end of a chopstick, or wooden tool.""

That experience would save them a lot of hours of frustration and wasted time. 

What I am realizing though, is I think metal workers are not the place I need to be asking for advice. The metal workers on the other forums are also struggling with this level of detail, and I am also having issues with them not understanding, or caring why this amount of detail matters to me. 

I think I am going to take my questions over to jewelry forums, where I think this level of detail, and thickness of metal is something they would be more accustomed to working with.

">Pavlov's document was political and designed to rebuke Tukhachevsky.

Tukhachevsky was long gone when Pavlov gave his impressions of what happened in the Spanish Civil War and what his participation led to in terms of ideas for the future of mechanized forces. Your statement doesn't coincide with reality, although I'm happy to entertain a source if you'd like to present one.

>Stalin's speech to the party after the war, in April 1940. Panicked may be a strong word, but given how rarely Stalin liked to admit he's wrong, I feel justified in that statement. His comments about how military leaders can't assume the army is invincible were read as a tacit admission that reform had to be pushed through. His criticisms of leaders revering the civil war and its traditions of spirit and elan, and the Red Army's delusions about the victory in Poland being a real war. He also emphasized that tanks would be needed in the thousands rather than hundreds, and en masse rather than scattered. Finally, Stalin criticized the lack of initiative by the leaders of the Winter War, which was basically Stalin eating crow because he appointed those leaders, he bypassed the General Staff and he micromanaged the war.

Your original statement was:
>The embarrassment of the Winter War against Finland in 1939-1940 forced Stalin's hand and combined arms, massed armor, and the doctrine of mobile attack were no longer taboo.

Unless that statement was a simple generalization, I don't see it coinciding with what you said further above. And, once more, while the Winter War changed much in terms of Soviet military doctrine, it had little if anything to do with armor doctrine nor did it overturn any 'taboos'. The Red Army continued to concentrate on offensive-oriented warfare and ignored defensive aspects of its doctrine right through 1941.

That's incorrect. The Wehrmacht outnumbered the Red Army in terms of man-power throughout the majority of 1941. And every single time they concentrated their forces for a breakthrough.

> Finland has seen a steady, but small influx of refugees over the past decade or two.

This part is actually true. Congratulations. However, refugee != immigrant.

> Thanks to the well developed social system and small rate of immigration, all immigrants are ""processed"". They're trained, taught the language and settled into decent homes.

So lets skip all the business about refugees you started out with, shall we? The Finnish social system is well developed (although seemingly slowly deteriorating) to handle Finns. It isn't, however, well adapted to handling immigration. I simply don't know what you mean by ""training"" because there certainly are plenty of immigrants (largely but not exclusively Somalis) who do not welcome training or the training simply doesn't meet the required standards to accodomate them into mainstream society. Immigrants who work and get into working life quickly have the best chances of making a life for themselves - this does not happen because of some government program. Also, ""settled into decent homes"" sounds like some sort of au pair program. And you make it sound as if learning Finnish is easy, which it certainly isn't. Most immigrants get by with English, if I'm not entirely mistaken.

> The other kind of immigrant, is the exact opposite. Usually white, rich Americans or Russians. They bring jobs and money, so they're very welcome.

Russian immigrants to Finland are not typically rich. I simply don't think you know what you're talking about, mate. Most immigration in Finland is intra-European Union, obviously. Why would a rich American even move to Finland? Answer this question, oh would you please. Are you confusing immigration with tourism?

I don't know what large European cities (I don't even know if I'd count Helsinki as one) you've been to but race is hardly ignored in most of them. In the UK you'd find cities like that, but it's a unfortunate fact that racial division exists in a lot of European cities. Sure, culture is changing, young people hook up with whomever they want but in Helsinki we're still far away of any sort of racially oblivious culture.

>How do we know when someone is conscious? It is a rather nebulous term. Do you mean self-conscious? able to react to external stimuli?

""Consciousness—The having of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; awareness. The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means. Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousness—to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.""

What' ""saw as"" meant to mean? sounds like when people say ""I see marriage a between a man and a woman and nothing else"". It's a not very honest way to frame ""people not like me make me feel uncomfortable for reasons I can't articulate"". ""see"" implies some innate natural reaction, but all this stuff is learned behavior that can be changed.

Humans do have a natural tendency to be jealous/insecure, but we also have a natural tendency to get angry, possessive, selfish as ell. They're all vices we should seek to remove from our character. Only with jealousy and insecurity do people seem okay with enshrining them as innate preferences rather than flaws.

The fact is you can learn not to be jealous and insecure about things like a girl having slept with someone you know. Not only can you do it but its much better for you if you learn to deal with those emotions rather than just hide from them, because those emotions pretty much universally stem from a lack of confidence and comfort with yourself and your value.

If you look at tribes where sexual promiscuity is the norm, there's no concept of ""sluts"", there's no idea that someone has a preference for chaste women.

I have no problem with sexual preferences, but I do have a problem with sexual hang ups (both because they limit the people who have them and encourage shitty attitudes to those who don't).

Silly sentence not worth taking seriously. Under socialism, we see that scientific and technological advancement was extraordinary. To suggest that communism is the end of technological advancement, in spite of everything suggested in this thread (motivations of need, curiosity, etc) is just silly.


That said, communism is thought of only being possible with advanced productive forces.


In the meantime, a dictatorship of the proletariat directs production to 

1. Meet needs

2. Advance productive forces to a degree such as to drive necessary labor-hours down to zero, (i.e. ""full unemployment, from the capitalist perspective)

Its already being done, you just seem to believe that whips and wages is what makes it happen. Invisible Hands ~~of God~~ make planes fly apparently... 

It's wrong ofc, the proletariat ensure that this all occurs. When they begin to do things for themselves, with tools such as central planning, price information becomes increasingly irrelevant, while metrics such as material balances more so.

You still refuse to acknowledge how the end of wage-slavery would benefit more than 6 billion people, because you're still on the idea of wanting your stock options (while 6 billion toil 12 hours in the hope of meeting their calorie requirements), and that the only way about this is to keep capitalism.

"Ummm no. You need to reread the thread and what I actually said vs what you think I said. 

I said was that it made me sad that people thought having kids was throwing your life away. This is the life I chose and I think it’s awesome. 

I’ve said many times that if people don’t want kids they shouldn’t have them and don’t owe anyone an explanation as to why. I have a couple of friends who are childless by choice and it’s not an issue we even discuss because “you do you”. 

The only part I take issue is when people say having kids is a 24/7 job that keeps parents from being able to pursue their own ambitions OR when people imply I’m leaving some kind of sad shadow existence where I live only to serve my children. Do some people approach parenting that way? Sure. And I think it’s unhealthy for everyone involved. It’s perfectly possible to have kids and pursue ambitions. I don’t want people to make a choice based on a lie. That’s the o my point I’ve made in this whole thread. 

To answer your question, going on 2 week vacations isn’t something that appeals to me (kind of a homebody), but I have several friends with kids who do it annually. I do make lots of time for things that do appeal to me like reading, gardening, having coffee with friends, going on dates with my husband( etc). "
"The glorification and obsession with violence. See, Rorschach against cops, Nightowl/Spectre against alley gang, Nightowl+Rorschach vs Ozymandias.

It was not meant for the medium of film. It was a comic book in the sense of the artistic medium as well as the story being a comic book story stretched to its limits. Moore wanted us to question everything we assumed about the medium and its character, and though it resonated far and wide, the most superficial parts are what fascinate people. The violence, the sex, the juvenile detachment of Manhattan and the Nietzschian morality of Viedt, t he cynical rebelliousness of Rorschach. They were all meant to be mocked through their individual ineptitudes, the kind of mocking you'd expect from a man who seriously put on tights and a cape and beat up petty crooks.

One of these was solar power, which he targeted with his company SolarCity. Another was the electric car, which he targeted with Tesla. And the third was the privatized space industry which he targeted with SpaceX.

Although Elon Musk continues to be lauded for his vision for all humanity, what he is doing makes perfect business sense. He sees a market imperfections and takes advantage of them. When other people doubted e-pay, he held on. When he saw the ability to secure government funding in the solar, electric vehicle, and space markets, he took the opportunity.

You might know that, but a lot of people on this sub seem to genuinely believe that socialism is people wanting free stuff.

Socialists don't want to come here because they get all sorts of shitposts like many of the ones you see on this thread. Plus, there is only so many times you can explain that socialism isn't higher taxes to someone before you rage quit.

>So the reason we oversimplify socialism, is not because we don't ""understand"". It's just that we don't really care.

Maybe that is the reason you oversimplify it. The reason the majority of people oversimplify it is because they don't know what the fuck it is.

>By the way, socialism isn't really this one monolithic belief. It's a range of social systems and your personal branch of socialism might not be the same as the general understanding here. 

That is true, but all branches of socialists believe in workers controlling the means of production.

And if your general understanding of socialism is higher taxes and all that bullshit, then you need to stop conflating real socialists with your fake American socialists. Because you see ancaps all the time wondering how it isn't a contradiction for anarchists to be socialists when socialism is higher taxes. The reason they are so confused is evidently because users like you ""don't care"" and let them wallow in ignorance.

"Yes, it was an insult, and it was uncalled-for. I take it back and I apologise.

I do, however, still hold to my judgement that your arguments on the issue at hand don't make any great sense. To recap: The OP's question concerned how one can reconcile a good God with a pain-filled creation. Your response was that suffering is caused by the freely-chosen sinful action of our first parents. I said that this is not an adequate answer as suffering is hard-coded into creaturely existence, starting over 200 million years before homo sapiens.

And this, I think, is where things begin to lose contact with reality. You say – very strangely, it seems to me, as you call yourself a man of science – that we have no empirical data from before the fall. Of course we do, I respond; it's called the fossil record. We know that for 200 million years it was most often the case that the most efficient predators survived. The common lot of animalkind was a life of fear, injury, loss, mutilation and death, and it was this 200-million-year-long scenario that enabled homo sapiens to emerge. Clearly, then, the problem of pain is a serious matter for theists, not one to be brushed off lightly or tritely.

I detect two distinct responses from you on the subject of animal suffering before humankind. They don't sit well together, and neither of them in my opinion has anything going for them. On the one hand you say – repeat, rather – that we really don't know what happened before humankind because it could all have been changed by the fall of Adam and Eve. As God is outside the spacetime continuum, it is possible that he could make it so that a later event could have caused, so to speak, an earlier event. Hence, all of life before the Garden of Eden may have been retro-actively tainted by the first sin. Or is it (I'm doing my best to interpret you here) that the configuration of life before Eden was allowed by God in the light of his time-independent knowledge of Adam's fall to come? I'm not sure about this reading as you talk about the possibility of something (I have no idea what) being removed from the pre-Edenic past. This suggests that life before Eden had a certain configuration, then Adam sinned, then God altered the past. 

Altered the past? What about the fossil record? Did these creatures exist or not? Were they shaped the way the fossils say they were? Did they have those serrated teeth for stripping flesh from bones? Did they have tusks and claws and horns and wrecking-balls at the ends of their tails, and do these features not mean definitively and beyond all reasonable doubt that – irrespective of the cosmic impact of the fall – there were indeed over 200 million years of animals who lived lives that were nasty, brutish and short? In a word, is it not true, as I said from the start, that pain has been part and parcel of life on this planet ever since the first appearance of a central nervous system?

Which brings me to your second response. You say:

> But as a general part of Catholic belief, only humans can truly suffer, as true suffering requires a being with a rational soul. Suffering is a metaphysical thing, an idea, you are treating it here as some sort of strictly physical fact. This isn't the way we believe suffering exists. 

Now I'm pretty sure that not a single claim in this paragraph is true. And none of it is ""a general part of Catholic belief"". Animal suffering is true suffering. The notion that ""suffering is a metaphysical thing, an idea"" makes no sense. Firstly, a ""metaphysical thing"" and ""an idea"" are not synonymous. Secondly, of course it's true that some pain suffered by rational creatures entails (so to speak) soul-related elements, but these could be covered by such words as ""psychological"" or ""existential"". ""Metaphysical""? No. ""This isn't the way we believe suffering exists"" – what does this mean? Of course Catholics don't believe that all pain is purely physical, but all Catholics in their right minds believe that purely physical pain is very definitely pain. So, yes, animals suffer pain. Real pain. You break a leg and you are in agony. A dog breaks a leg, and it's in agony too. 

And on top of that, we know that animals can also experience higher-order pains. You are pursued by a mugger with murder in his eyes and you suffer extreme anxiety. A zebra is pursued by a lion on the serengheti, and its heart-rate rises rapidly, adrenalin shoots into its system, it flees as fast as it is able for fear of being killed – all just like you. Higher animals have now been observed many times to show clear signs of anxiety or grief or anger or depression. There are differences between this and certain kinds – only certain kinds – of pain experience by humans, but there can be no serious doubt that animals suffer real pain.

This is going on too long, so I'm going to take the easy way out and quote the catechism:

> 2416: Animals are God's creatures. He surrounds them with his providential care...We should recall the gentleness with which saints like St. Francis of Assisi or St. Philip Neri treated animals.

Also this: ""2418: It is contrary to human dignity to cause animals to suffer or die needlessly.""

So, no, you don't have the ""general part of Catholic belief"" right at all. Which means we're right back at the problem raised at the start: How can we reconcile an omnibenevolent God with a world that has suffering inscribed deeply into its basic structure, so much so that human life could not even have emerged without millions of years of animal agony and death?

It's a real issue, and it need cautious and tentative responses. This has been my one point all along. Easy answers are not helpful.

And by the way, I am a theist and a Catholic."
"I've literally seen videos of doctors and medics being shot while helping people. The IDF are scum and any Irish person who makes a statement like you've done seriously needs to take a look at themselves. What about the British soldiers who shot dead Irish children, I guess that's okay then?"
"Let´s set aside any differences and pretend our entire community speaks with one voice. Let´s also pretend our demand has even the slightest chance to be heard in a world that gets increasingly mad and vicious , with global crises, nationalism and despotism on the rise (Erdogan, Putin and Tangerine Nightmare, for example).

To bring change, we need a political party. Which existing party would openly support our claims? None. Would we found our own, monothematic party, with all that´s needed like money (lots of it), a program and foremost, faces people can and will remember the next time they stand in the election booth? Who would commit social suicide? Who would definitely ruin his or her life extensively and will be known as ""the animal fucker"" advocate ´til the end of his life? 
A monothematic party usually doesn´t last very long in parliaments, the Pirate party being one of the examples for that . Strong in Germany and other European countries a few years ago, but only for one election. When we talk about change, we have to respect the DEMOCRATIC process. Like it or not, it is a fact that laws against ""zoophilia"" are what the people want. I doubt there will ever be a majority that marches the streets around your parliament, waving signs with slogans like "" animal sex is human right"" or something similar. Most people are GLAD these laws have been introduced. To turn around a majority of people 180 degrees from what they´re thinking is wishful thinking, at best. Especially when the group of people trying to influence public opinion does everything to alienate Average Joe and Jill with irresponsible actions that harm society in whole (fencehopping, animal porn distribution etc...). The ""normal"" , democratic process to change laws will not succeed when you don´t have the ""political climate"" to support your claims. The ""summer of Love"" of the 70´s was a political singularity, a once-in-a-milennium incident, fueled by the Vietnam war and , more importantly, the then independent media coverage of it, showing absurdity, cruelty and suffering instead of a glorious fight of ""our ""heroes. Compare it to today´s ""embedded journalism"" and you see what this was and will probably be a singularity for the next 500 years to come. 

The people are against us. What other ways do we have? We can hope for science to come up with my ""UAHT"" , the universal animal-human translator. To convince the majority, this is nothing less than obligatory and the only way accusations of rape will disappear once and for all. Only when an animal can communicate its wishes and desires clearly, saying ""I want to have intercourse with my human"", only then a majority of people will change their minds and make change possible.
What else is there for us? Let´s see...lobbyism, clandestine lobbyism like what the multinational corporations do. We simply don´t have enough wealth and influence for that. 
Some of us might even think about becoming dictators, taking over their country, issuing decrees that wipe away any of these ""unjust"" laws. But dictatorship is Janus-headed, unhinged power quickly brings out the worst in everyone. It´s not just a coincidence that there hasn´t ever been a ""dictatorship of clemency"" yet, power corrupts...do you want to live under a dictator who ""allows"" fucking animals, but shits on basic human rights? Are you willing to pay this price?

What else is left? Challenging the laws via lawyers may look like a promising way to get things done, but this is also nothing but an utopian fever dream. Our worldwide community of beasties and zoos has made the mistake of putting the most unfavorable picture of us out there, establishing the image of zoophilia = animal abuse for centuries. There´s a reason zoophilia is a synonym for fucking animals now. Voices like mine aren´t heard, more porn with clear signs of abuse is uploaded every day, our public image completely shattered. Where are the pictures showing the love instead of the sex? Haven´t seen many, to be honest. To influence the public image, you have to play the game according to THEIR rules. You have to respect the fact that poly crap, mixed ""zoophilia"" (animals and humans), ""fuck parties"" and ""making it possible for a ""zoo friend"" to scratch one entry from his/her ""bucket list"" undeniably send out the message "" They call it zoophilia, love for animals, but it´s neither , it´s not about animals, it´s about human selfish desires, and it´s not about loive , it´s about sex and the itching in the groin"". 

So, is there anything else left? Not to my knowledge. Public opinion changing? Forget it, not with what our community presents itself in the internet. Science? Hell, when the best we have is often cited, but rarely understood Hani Miletski ""study"", science is kind of a dead end right now. Legal actions? See ZETA and their attempt to challenge the German law. And the BVerfG was VERY kind, even made it clear that the law has a loophole in it that allows judges to acquit ""zoophiles"" when punishment creates more harm than it prevents.

I appreciate your desire to ""legalise"" my orientation, but I also see that we´re not living in the times for that right now. 
As hard as it is to swallow for you, but we have to learn to live with the laws, have to learn how to minimise the damage they CAN do to some of us. We have to prioritize PRIVACY...common sense is self defense. We have to be patient and wait for another of these moments like the ""summer of love""...wait for another of that tremenduously rare moments when everything seems possible. Timing is vital. Our enemies outnumber AND outgun us by 1 to a million, maybe even more...we have to instrumentalise guerrilla tactics, hit and run...and we have to wait for that one moment in time and space...this moment when one good punch thrown at the right spot topples Goliath. Unloading all our ammo into a concrete wall that´s 5 kilometers thick is stupid...
Patience is needed as much as awareness of our real situation , without any of this ""zoo is the new gay"" sermon, without furor. Snipers, Ninjas and Saboteurs, that´s how we should deal with the current situation. 

And while we sit and patiently wait for OUR chance, for the next singularity opening up to place this one, gamechanging shot, you, Egoldstein, should be thankful for your Finnish prime minister and his sturdyness against Op Beast´s blackmail attempts. Be grateful that you´re one of the ""lucky"" three countries in Europe that hasn´t introduced ""anti zoo"" laws (yet). You should hope that incidents like the one with the intoxicated ""pig lover"" from the article stay rare, hope that the lack of ""anti zoo"" laws won´t turn your country into a safe haven for animal fuckers and pornographers from around the world, undermining the trust your government places in the rationality of Finnish zoophiles (although....I´ve met two Finns during my IRC times...they can easily count as top ten material of the most fucked up people I´ve ever met).

Please do yourself a favor and THINK things THROUGH before making any claims and demands. All those ""zoo advocates"" screaming ""justice for zoos"" usually quit thinking after their three word slogan is exclaimed...think ahead, think outside of the box. And maybe you´ll finally come to the conclusion that a) the current situation isn´t as bad as many depict it, at least in some parts of the world and b) my proposals aren´t as retarded as they seem at first sight.

Are you not aware that hackers and modders cannot join private sessions, and thus can't mess with you there? Are you even aware private sessions exist? Do you play with a crew?

As I said before, there are ways around these assholes. It sucks you have to do it, but if the game is worth playing, it's worth spending a little extra time isolating yourself from the kinds of players you don't like.

If you bothered to try to understand what people were saying about Islam you would see that they always speak of doctrinal or cultural aspects of the religion - totally irrespective of the race of the Muslim people. It;s the left who are the racists here. The right don't automatically associate all Muslims with Arabs. YOU do. Your assertion that people speaking about Islam are in fact doing so to attack Arabs is YOUR racism.

The right understand very well there are Christian Arabs or minority other religion Arabs in the Middle East. It was the right who wanted the Christian minority in Syria rescued from sex slavery and murder. The left didn't give a fuck. Why? The left unashamedly hate Christianity.

Stop trying to paint the right with your own ignorance. The left can't comprehend Islam is not a race. I've been told by many leftists that Islam is a race because it's a ""minority religion"" and ""mostly non white"". The first is a lie, and the second is only true outside Europe where most Muslims are white if you consider eastern Europe. So what? Neither make Islam a race. I've also been told by several hard left nuts that Islam is a race because it's persecuted in the West. That's a lie. You don't have special protections for Islamic practices like gender discrimination or hate speech against gay people if you are ""persecuted"". Secondly, there are religions far more ""persecuted"" in the West which are in no way considered a race of humans. Scientology is banned in Germany. Does that qualify it as a race? No, that would be ridiculous. Just as declaring Islam a race is ridiculous."

Do they work in insurance? Do they really have any real idea about what they are talking about? The answer is no. If they worked in insurance they would tell you what I am telling you now, your boyfriend was entering traffic. Your boyfriend's duty owed was to be aware of the current traffic while entering and to accommodate the other drivers while entering traffic. He breached this duty. Therefore he is at fault for this. It does not really matter that the other driver changed lanes. They were currently in the flow of traffic which he was entering.

"> Lotteries are designed both to have a winner

No, not necessarily. It's immaterial though.

> The odds of opening 400 and not winning anything are probably exponentially lower than the odds of winning the lottery itself.

Source...

And even supposing they were, that doesn't necessarily mean anything. People have won lotteries five times in a row, that is the definition of exponentially less likely than winning the lottery and it's clearly a possibility.

> And again, the odds of not finding such a prize in 400 tries is very likely lower than the odds of winning the lottery itself.

No. The odds of any one person not winning a prize in 400 tries are pretty low. The odds of some person, which is what is relevant, not winning a prize are nothing remarkable. You don't understand the crux of the issue is an informational bias. There are millions and millions and millions of people buying lottery tickets every day, some in huge quantities. Only one of them needs to get supremely unlucky to show up on reddit.

"There's nothing to disagree with here. You're confusing a type system (which is where strong vs weak and static vs dynamic come in), a construct that's more aimed at the developer to prevent errors, with actual data types_, constructs that are aimed at a much lower level. Case in point: Assembly has plenty of data types (SBYTE, WORD, QWORD, etc) but has no type system whatsoever. You can have a strong, static type system but represent your data types with all the common sense of a potato.

The way JS handles numbers is just straight up dumb, and has nothing (directly) to do with its choice of typing discipline (see PHP, a language that somehow manages to be even more loosely typed than JS and yet represents data types properly under the hood. Or see Java, which also can't handle large numbers as primitives because of the way it represents its data types under the hood, but goes the infinitely more sensible route of providing builtin BigInteger and BigDecimal objects)."

If you mean that rule 5 can be agreed upon that makes it subjective then your just wrong blatantly so.

"The vast majority of those 300 million+ guns will be broken, rusted out or otherwise unusable within 10 years, and you can accelerate their removal with generous tax credit and buyback programs for turning them in. And the same thing is true of high capacity magazines. Eventually, they'll break and have to be replaced, and if the only legal thing to replace them with is a low capacity magazine, well, that's what law-abiding gun owners will use, and we'll reach a point where even criminals will have a hard time getting ahold of fast-reload weapons with high capacity magazines because there won't be very many of them left around anymore. You don't see many holdups with Colt Peacemakers anymore, after all. A policy of restricting reload times to 10 seconds or greater and banning the manufacture of high capacity magazines isn't one to create a difference tomorrow, or next year, but it will have a difference 5, 10 and 20 years down the line.

Your mistakes with thinking that more concealed carriers will be a solution are (at least) two-fold. First, correlation doesn't equal causation. Even if I bought your assertion that concealed carriers were less likely to commit crimes than police officers, the reason for that is because the process of getting certified to conceal and carry already weeds out those inclined to commit crimes. It doesn't change the people, it self-selects. Pushing more people through the process is just going to make it more likely that concealed carriers commit crimes. Second, putting more bullets into a shooting situation just increases the chances that innocent bystanders get hurt. The goal is to get an active shooter to stop shooting, not get everybody else to start.

The situation in France was a failing of local security forces during a celebration. More concealed carriers there would have been unlikely to stop that tragedy, and would have a much greater chance of making it worse by having more innocent people get caught in the crossfire. That said, lone-wolf terrorists and crazy people won't ever be stopped from trying to kill a bunch of people, and sometimes they'll succeed. The goal should be to make it as hard as possible for them to succeed keeping in mind that perfection is never going to be attainable, while minimizing the risks to everybody else. Concealed carriers don't minimize those risks, they exacerbate them.

The reason gun control discussions aren't fruitful is because recreational gun collectors/users value their own access to their preferred form of entertainment and dubious security over the lives of other people's children and grandchildren, and will appeal to the most spurious rhetorical fallacies to support their preferences. From an appeal to futility (there's too many guns with those features to get rid of them all! Yes there are a lot of them, but we'll never get fewer of them if we don't do something to stop their proliferation), to the perfectionist fallacy (killers will still be able to kill people! Yes, they will, but it'll be a lot harder for them to do that and the incidence of occurrence and deadliness of those incidents will be reduced), to the legalist fallacy (It's my constitutional right to be armed, so it's not wrong for me to want a 100 round magazine for a semi-automatic weapon capable of being reloaded in half a second that can fire three rounds per second. Yes, it is your legal right, but being currently legal doesn't mean that it's moral nor that it should be legal.)

It doesn't surprise me at all that you haven't experienced this kind of harassment for yourself, then. Lots of gamers use characters of the opposite gender, so having a female toon doesn't mean anything to most people. In my experience, the default is just to assume that the other player is a male (just like on Reddit) until proven wrong, and text comm is not going to prove them wrong. Which is why hearing a female voice over a microphone is oftentimes a catalyst for negative reactions, while text communication is not because it doesn't inherently reveal gender in the same way.

"I have to take issue with your argument about ""no genetic basis for inherited immunity"". 

First, I am an actual PhD in microbiology (you can look at my admittedly brief history of posting to see a post I made a month ago talking about the class I'm teaching.)

Secondly, this article in PNAS discusses an inherited mutation that confers a survival advantage in people who's ancestors survived multiple rounds of small pox.

>The high frequency, recent origin, and geographic distribution of the CCR5-Δ32 deletion allele together indicate that it has been intensely selected in Europe. Although the allele confers resistance against HIV-1, HIV has not existed in the human population long enough to account for this selective pressure. The prevailing hypothesis is that the selective rise of CCR5-Δ32 to its current frequency can be attributed to bubonic plague. By using a population genetic framework that takes into account the temporal pattern and age-dependent nature of specific diseases, we find that smallpox is more consistent with this historical role.

Translation: smallpox mortality selected for a variant gene (called CCR5-Δ32) that confers a higher rate of survival in individuals exposed to a virus that uses that portal of entry - as does smallpox (and HIV). That CCR5-d32 allele is found only in populations in Europe.

That is how evolution works - selective pressure (increased mortality of a particular genotype) increases the prevalence of resistant genotypes in a population. It's not about the ""superiority"" of Europeans relative to the Native populations - it's about who's ancestors survived repeated waves of contagious disease. 

As a specific refutation of your point, consider this from an article in The Atlantic, discussing Thomas Mann's book 1491

> Roughly speaking, an individual's set of defensive tools is known as his MHC type. Because many bacteria and viruses mutate easily, they usually attack in the form of several slightly different strains. Pathogens win when MHC types miss some of the strains and the immune system is not stimulated to act. Most human groups contain many MHC types; a strain that slips by one person's defenses will be nailed by the defenses of the next. But, according to Francis L. Black, an epidemiologist at Yale University, Indians are characterized by unusually homogenous MHC types. One out of three South American Indians have similar MHC types; among Africans the corresponding figure is one in 200. The cause is a matter for Darwinian speculation, the effects less so.

As OP correctly noted, everyone has an adaptive immune system. Our adaptive immune systems, however, adapt to selective pressures just as do any other genetically-based system. A less diverse set of MHC genes (one of the key features of the adaptive immune system) indicates less adaptability in the face of challenge by potential pathogens.

There are also modelling studies that confirm exactly the opposite of the opinion you stated, that resistance to disease cannot be inherited. This Science Daily article summarizes a recent paper looking at the effect of selection on inherited immunity.

>Schliekelman used mathematical models to calculate the possible effect of “kin selection” on natural evolution. “Natural selection is typically seen as ‘survival of the fittest’, but in this case it might be more accurate to say ‘survival of the fittest families,’” says Schliekelman.

Yes, it's a mathematical model, but that's how a lot of epidemiology and evolution works - it's necessarily large-scale.


Finally, consider the extensive evidence from modern-day contact between immunologically naive native populations in the Amazon and Western diseases such as measles, influenza and even the common cold. The death rate for influenza in western populations is 0.1 to 0.2%, or less, and death is largely limited to the very young and very old. Mortality due to influenza can be 20-30% in Amazonian indian tribes, with no prior or historical (ancestral) exposure to the virus.

In short, OP, you are misapplying the legitimate language of cultural conflict to questions of science. ""Naive"" in an immunological sense is not equal to ""naive"" in an ethical or experiential sense."

The people that hire the factories are mostly in the west and the factories are mostly in the south and Asia where there arent many people with white skin. The white supremacy comes into play when the northern white people take this attitude like ""oh isnt it so great that these wretched poor people in south america (or where ever) finally have these shiny new jobs so they can pay for things and have shiny lives just like where have in america? Didnt we do such a nice thing?"" when in fact the situation on the ground is that the factory workers used to be farmers and other people carrying down traditional forms of labor and subsistence which all got royally shat upon when the factories opened on their land. Now the white people are getting rich and living lavish well endowed lives off the labor of these poor culturally disenfranchised peoples of color suffering the injustices of a world set up to only value them enough at a rate 65 cents an hour. 

This isnt even to mention that every time these unfortunate people try to do something as absurd as pass land reforms or get their government working for the people and the corporations from the north fueling ""development"" the leaders of populist movements tend to get assassinated by the military or the CIA. 

You've beeb misinformed because youve been told that these people are better off in factories working in jobs for transnational corporations becausr thats the lie that you personally live in.

"> There are a multitude of Palestinian solidarity organizations that not only provide material aid to Palestinian refugees, but promote the cause of Palestinian liberation and occasionally even send money to Palestinian resistance organizations.

>Also how disconnected are you from the Palestinian resistance movement that you think the peak of its action is petitions and demonstrations? You know theres actual armed struggle going on, right?

I know all this, and my point is anarchists can participate in it without reference to the question of statehood. What action does specifically reference statehood? Only the ""politics of demand"", which can be coupled with armed struggle but isn't necessary for it, and is very alien to how anarchists practice direct action.

>Not really. What neocolonialism has done is distort their development so that it fits in with global value chains. This requires a degree of keeping capitalism underdeveloped, retaining pre-capitalist social formations like feudalism in the countryside. While the cities may become incredibly industrialized, agriculture is held back, and the state becomes a tool not just of the capitalist class, but of the comprador capitalists who act in service of global imperialism.

This is a huge oversimplification and very much feels like an attempt to fit contemporary developments into old theoretical frameworks that don't suit them (feudalism in agricultural relations, really?). But it at least demonstrates an awareness that globalisation is happening which your previous post didn't. Really, saying contemporary imperialism blocks ""developments towards industrialisation"" just suggests to me that you haven't actually read much literature on modern geopolitics and are still trying to understand them from the perspective of Lenin's work on imperialism, which, aside from anything else, was written to describe a very different global socio-economic situation than the one we face now. More to the point I have no idea why you would say that if you apparently knew globalisation is leading to huge industrial growth in urban centres of the developing world? And must have therefore also known that industrial manufacturing is the backbone of many developing economies???

>But trade can exist in non-exploitative contexts (or at least, non-imperialist ones). Socialist states don't have to completely cut off from trade, but when that trade benefits imperialism, its a necessity that they do. 

Sorry, you can't have capitalist exchange without capital. And you especially now can't have global capitalist exchange without global capital, not in a world where global multi-nationals are bigger than the states in question.

>Where did I ever give off the idea I'm advocating reform lol

Oh, I didn't mean to imply that you were. I was just trying to appeal to your better instincts as a socialist.

>What Lenin was doing in What Is To Be Done? is not advocating for the dominance of the intelligentsia, but criticizing the socialist theoreticians (which were, and to a degree still are, largely petit-bourgeoisie) before him of not being able to work with the working class. The text is also very contextual to the time it was written and isn't exactly universal in all aspects.

Right then. So what did he mean by this?

>We have said that there could not have been Social-Democratic consciousness among the workers. It would have to be brought to them from without. The history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness, i.e., the conviction that it is necessary to combine in unions, fight the employers, and strive to compel the government to pass necessary labour legislation, etc. The theory of socialism, however, grew out of the philosophic, historical, and economic theories elaborated by educated representatives of the propertied classes, by intellectuals. By their social status the founders of modern scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, themselves belonged to the bourgeois intelligentsia. 

Seems like a pretty universal statement on the historical laws that govern class relations and consciousness, if you ask me. Of course, there are a tonne of other passages from Lenin's work where he was more vague (perhaps deliberately) as to whether ""'proletarian leadership"" means the leadership of the proletariat or the party that represents the proletariat, but given his overall argument in ""What Is To Be Done?"" and how the USSR actually turned out... I think it's pretty clear what he meant.

>Lmao I never argued for class collaboration. Class collaboration implies the liquidation of the proletariat and its political bodies into the sphere of the bourgeoisie. What matters is the class in command, and that should be the proletariat.

And my point is that the viability of ""proletarian leadership"" within liberal institutions such as the nation-state is not very good, especially when this necessitates cooperation (what you might call collaboration) with capitalist classes, which always leads to the submission of proletarian interests to capital. This is something any socialist should be able to see."
"A little harsh, but I think I need to hear this. I'll address your points in order. First, you are saying that I do not understand the community. That's exactly why I posted this, so I could better understand the needs of DNs. This is the beginning stages of the idea and the business model is not set in stone. I am looking to launch in May/June 2016, so I came on here to get feedback and tweak my idea. This is a process. 

 Accommodations: Depending on locations I will stick to apartments/houses.

 Commitment: I have received this comment a lot and will probably change it. I initially did the 4 month minimum because I wanted build the community aspect of the experience. If people are switching in and out every month they are not building lasting professional or personal relationships which is the biggest need I am trying to solve. Also, I am a business man. If someone really wanted to move on or was having a miserable time I would let them leave without a ding. I am going to make the 4 month minimum a recommendation, so it doesn't sound as strict.

 Things I am not considering: I am offering dedicated work space in a co-working office/area. It doesn't sound like I am making this clear enough and will update the language. Local staff, laundry, events etc are all things I will look into. Thanks for the ideas.

 The 5k is steep. I know. I wanted a security deposit in case something happens and also to keep people from treating this like a vacation. I am looking at it as if your'e renting an apartment and put down a security deposit and first months rent. I will change this to 4K down and this includes first months payment and 2K is held as security and returned later. 

 Price: I came to the price of this service by considering my competition's price and also the research I did on the what it will cost me to provide these services. Here is the breakdown: Hackers 2K per month (Does not include travel to the next location) RemoteYear: 2K/month + 3k down payment to reserve your spot. 

Here is my breakdown of the major costs: Co-working space: ~$100 to $650/month depending on location. Accommodations: ~$500-$1,000/month depending on location. Travel to the next location: Depends on mode of transportation and the destination. Within the region shouldn't be too expensive, but outside the region can be up to 2k. Looking at these costs please explain to me how I am making $625/month per person? I don't think I am being greedy trying to make 10-15%. 

 Competition: They are going to a place off the cost of Valenzuela, so of course they are going to be able to get more. I will be losing money going to places like Croatia, Prague and Tokyo. So, I will need to make up that lost money when I go to SE Asia and South America. 

 Your last point is a good one. I have been looking into going on one of these trips to experience it first hand. Also, I am a trying to bring on a partner that is a DN. He is a friend of a friend and travels 6 months out of the year. 

Even though some of your comments were pretty harsh thanks for the tips and recommendations."

">I sure hope the four of you have been engaging in an intellectual exercise

You're damned right it's an intellectual exercise. You've been attacking people for immoral thought, but when asked to identify your moral stance, you gave such a wide window (12 is too young, 25 is old enough) and couched your beliefs in so many qualifiers as to render your actual moral stance unquantifiable. Can you see how, if, for example, you were a politician, news coverage would be dissecting your statement by saying that:

>""Triquetra4715"" says that 12 is obviously too young, but he/she leaves any older age open to interpretation. He/she gives two indicators that (in his/her opinion) qualify an individual for reproductive self-determination. Neither of these indicators would preclude a 13-year-old from becoming reproductively self-determinant. Therefore, Triquetra4715 has undermined their original premise that a 16-year-old does not have the right to reproductive self-determination.

I'm not trying to put you down, just trying to show that your own views are strongly informed by cultural norms: in short, you have grown up in a culture where adults become self-actualized at 18 years of age.

"> What third wave academic feminism tries to do is dissect the subtle societal reasons for why this happens. And based upon the examples you gave, these are issues affecting primarily men of color. So, why is this so? This is where the concept of intersectionality, which is the defining feature of third wave feminism, comes into play.

You can put this spin on it to make it sound like anything about academic feminism is objective and rational; but the reality is that these arguments are primarily used to justify prejudicial, stereotyped, and bigoted attitudes about people. It is an attempt to make radicalised feminism into a mainstream viewpoint. 

And it also brings in the absurd idea that people who are in some way oppressed (intersectionality) are inherently better people than those who are not; that the validity of one's personal views and attitudes is inversely proportional to their perceived ""privilege"" level. 

>And they're crazy, but they're singular examples. Feminism isn't a monolith.

Workplace deaths, victims of violent crime, and suicide are not racial issues. However, they are gender issues. 

It is inappropriate to suggest that these problems ""primarily"" affect ""people or color"" (as a way to suggest that other victims don't matter?). Historic racism and the resulting poverty and population density are the primary persuasive factors in causing violence here; which can be seen among impoverished, urban populations even among fairly homogenous societies. 

The attitude that people of color, and Blacks in particular, experience these problems disproportionately because they are victimised is...shall we say, problematic? A collective sense of victimhood already permeates American Black culture; and this attitude of victimhood brings with it a rationale to both absolve individuals of the need to feel personally responsible for their course in life, and also provides reinforcement for a sense of entitlement, the idea that they are owed something. It makes possible a line of reasoning as follows: ""I am poor, and I am black. Therefore I am poor because I am black; and Since I cannot change my skin color I cannot change my socioeconomic status."" And also ""Because of the history of discrimination against people like me in this country, society owes me something in compensation."" 

While the ethical and social-justice ramifications of this are worthy of consideration (and perhaps reparations would in fact be justice for Blacks in America?), they are not relevant to the greater society as a whole, for two reasons. These two reasons are basically core values of the United States, and are two attitudes which have remained definitive of American values most consistently since the founding of the nation:

1) Nobody is really entitled to anything except their human and legal rights as defined by the Constitution.
2) Everyone is responsible for themselves individually. 

If anyone acts otherwise, its because they want something from you. Remember that. 

Most social welfare programs in the US primarily benefit racial minorities, and women benefit substantially more than men. People see this as a move towards social justice, but from a political standpoint, is anyone entitled to benefit from this redistribution of wealth? Probably not. Which means that politicians chose to do it. 

Are politicians altruistic? No. Corporations, Lobbyists and Unions fund politicians campaigns...make sure they keep their jobs. This form of legal corruption demonstrates whom politicians are beholden to. They need money to get votes; but there are other ways to get votes...such as buying off the voters with massive government benefits that will be paid to them. Social welfare programs in the US are nothing more than a means to achieve political power. Altruism has no place here. 

Thus, the front end of Feminism, while it may come from an altruistic origin, does not in practical application operate based on altruistic principles. IT cannot do so and function in a political environment where altruism and the public good are the absolute weakest lines of persuasion in the manipulation of political influence. "

Ahem.

You seem to be terrified of the idea of people who are different coming into your culture. What's so scary? What do you think is going to be lost in Europe by Syrians et al coming into the country? Are you afraid that Europe will lose its bitter secularization? Its contempt for the Church? Its misguided feminism? Its free and easy attitude towards permissive sexuality and contraception? Its gleeful embrace of gay marriage? What precisely about Europe do you think is so precious that these migrants would threaten? 

Pope St. John Paul II saw more common cause with devout Muslims than secularized Europeans - however abhorrent the theology, at least it acknowledges a God in heaven, a divine law which he has handed down for men, a proper place of honor for the family, and a sense of the sacred and the holy. The presence of some genuinely god-fearing people in Europe (even if their theology is wrong) might prove to be some valuable leaven for the apostate masses of Europe.

> I'm absolutely for helping victims, but the way in which we help matters, and we can't just ignore the consequences of such helping. When we don't, we're often not helping at all. 

This reminds me of something the late Dr. King said about the parable of the Good Samaritan: 

> You know, it's possible that the priest and the Levite looked over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around. Or it's possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking, and he was acting like he had been robbed and hurt in order to seize them over there, lure them there for quick and easy seizure. And so the first question that the priest asked, the first question that the Levite asked was, ""If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?"" 

> But then the Good Samaritan came by, and he reversed the question: ""If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?"" 

People - children, even - are literally getting their heads sawed off right now. We must rescue them first, and we can deal with their oppressors once the innocent are safe. We must attend to the wounded man on the road now, or he will die."
"> to get what he wants, he depends on unions

Did he say that? I didn't read the whole thread but I doubt he said or implied that.

I don't depend on unions. My job isn't unionized. To get what I want, I depend on my education giving me access to a better-paying, white-collar profession.

If some mafia guys showed up where I work and announced that our office was going to be unionized, and uh oh! a couple of people mysteriously had their knees broken when they opposed unionization, I might be upset. If you had the gall to tell me that instead of being upset, I should just go work at Walmart I might respond as he did. I might point out that I don't want to work at Walmart.

Walmart has minimum wage jobs. They're minimum wage jobs not because Walmart lacks a union, but because they're jobs that any idiot can do. I make a pretty good living, and I do not ""depend on unions"" for that living.

But again, I didn't read the entire thread so you may correct me. I'm just explaining how I would respond to the same thing he responded to."

A ""This Product Contains GMO"" (or anything similar) doesn't do this though.

Right now, with the current GMOs on the market, there isn't a reason to worry about your food. Are/can you be concerned about pesticide residues? Sure, but that pertains to all of modern agriculture. I'm still using the same herbicides, insecticides and fungicides on my peppers and cucumbers (well, there are actually a couple new fungicide formulations available for my cucumbers now) that I was using 10, 15, 20 years ago. If there was a Bt-expressing pepper plant, I could stop spraying insecticides (which would be great!).

>Because everything else uses natural reactions in the process. Scientifically tampered ones are a different thing entirely.

You have no concept of the hundreds of years of scientific research that has gone into the development of agriculture and plant/animal cultivars then. Thinking that ""scientific tampering"" is worse/lesser than a ""natural reaction"" just shows your ignorance, and I feel sad for you.

"Man, I loved your comment. No sarcasm here - I love it when people actually take the time to write like that.

I'll try and be brief:

- I disagree with your first paragraph. Too subjective so not worth arguing back and forth

- Your 2nd paragraph obviously has a lot of truth to it, but then again my words weren't exactly thought out poetry. The part of it that I felt was important enough to apply, still does. He was complaining that he had to explore his way into a dungeon, and I find that pathetic. Go play Tetris if you don't like a regular RPG open world. I also don't understand your ""Who is this everyone else"" question, it would be the WoW players from the past years who haven't cried about actually having to find a dungeon portal.

- Your 3rd paragraph is disappointing, because I think the meaning of ""responding"" is fairly obvious there. But since it apparently requires explanation (based on more replies), it meant a response to the content of his post, not just a reply per se. Is this farfetched? I didn't think there'd be confusion behind that bit in particular since the alternative is contradictory.

- Stuff about 'responding anyway' aside, I'm not sure I follow you in your 4th paragraph. If I acted 'the same', that means I was a hypocrite. How so? Also, everyone's behaviour is more validated for themselves than other people's. That's logically redundant, as I see it any way. How else could you ever criticize anything? Also, what is the problem exactly with 'broad statements'? If you can't base them on some actions, then you can't make them at all. It's not like you can have access to all actions.

And I can assure you I wasn't deflecting - I've just seen enough people calling others 'rude' - specifically that word - and realized a vast majority aren't worth the time trying to reason with. People who use that word, especially online, tend to be extremely sensitive, anxious and - worst of all - self-centered. They feel personally attacked by words and actions that could not care any less about them in the first place. I'm pretty sure I'm entitled to having this opinion, and that it is a valid one regardless of agreement on the behalf of others.

- at this point I have to add that I was typing my response as I read your post, and that your final paragraph puzzled me quite a bit. So you'd read my words on the 'respond' issue after all, but either did not understand them or just assumed I was lying my way out of a blunder? Either case is disappointing, I suppose.

I also wasn't trying to justify anything. I was implying he was perfectly aware of what I meant by not responding to that other person, but instead chose to pretend he didn't in order to try and get momentum in his criticism of me.

As for the rest of the paragraph, I am at a loss for words since I honestly do not understand where you're coming from with most of it.

All in all, pleasant exchange of words!"
"> Actually if you get government resources, you're the one that has to justify it to me, the taxpayer.

I have no idea what you're talking about.

> No, it isn't, you just don't have an answer. It's actually remarkably simple/intuitive. Here we have an institution which obviously exists because of how humans reproduce, and you can't think of WHY we would define it as being between the two sexes? Seriously?

Marriage, the institution, has existed in many forms and for many reasons. Used to be, women were treated like property via marriage.

And yes, why define marriage as being between the two sexes? Answer that for me.

Why does it matter how marriage is defined? What exactly happens when we redefine it? Will couples stop reproducing?

> I said it's not feasible. It would be costly (on a national scale) and intrusive to test for fertility anytime somebody wanted to get married. You would have people disputing the results as well because people who are determined to be fertile sometimes end up producing children.

Oh, so it isn't very important then to prevent infertile people from marrying. So why is it important to prevent gay people from marrying?

> Yeah I don't think you understand what I said. The whole point is that gay marriage is in the spotlight. People are considering it, and when considering it, you have to... you know... actually considerate it. If infertile marriages were currently in the public spotlight, people could make the case that their lack of fertility is a mark against them receiving benefits, and they would have a point.

Why would they have a point? What's the point, precisely?

Comment 1
""One of the most discouraging things to me about the terrible reasoning at TTM, and among truthers in general, is the heavy use of what I think of as ""laundry list"" reasoning."" --my comment--I am explaining my frustration about the reasoning in TTM, which I think is bad in general, what can I say. And I mean ""in general"" there are exceptions of course, and I do read some posts on TTM that I think make perfect sense. I have a specific argument I am making about a rhetorical strategy, employed by many truthers, where somehow every piece of suspicious evidence, apparent discrepancy, mistake, or lie by someone on the prosecution ""side"" in the Avery case is used to add weight to an alternative suspect, whether or not the evidence says anything about the reasonableness of that particular candidate.

Comment 2-
""I've tried to follow Foghaze's incomprehensible gibberish, but the most I can glean, and also from KZ's tweet, is that the accepted evidence that calls in to question TH's last location is this.""--this is from a discussion about theories about TH's last locations, based on cell phone tower data, that touched on some of Foghaze's recent lengthy and hard to parse posts on her cell phone theories. While perhaps not phrased so diplomatically, I seriously cannot make heads or tails of Foghaze's conspiracy theory laden explanations.

comment 4
""Wow, you are delusional. What evidence do you have that SAIG a handful of people with multiple accounts?

""The level of cognitive dissonance over there is truly amazing. They are decrying an unfair rush of judgement against against Avery, who has a ton of obvious evidence against him.

"> But one, he already had political experience.

Also, TBF, he hadn't even completed his first term as a US Senator when he got elected. I'm not sure how much weight I put on his political experience.

Also, if political experience does matter, he should have been crushed by McCain, which tells me that noboyd voted for him based on his experience.

>Two, he had real aims that were set in reality.

I guess. I mean, I'd say that he mentioned things that at least seemed possible although I'm not sure if specifics that he gave seemed practical or likely to work.

I mean, he advocated a health care system with guaranteed coverage, pricing that couldn't be changed based on an individual's heatlth, and no individual mandate.

Seriously, how in the fuck do the first two without the third? The first is obviously going to increase costs like crazy. If you can't make the sick pay more, as seen in the second part, you have to force healthy people to sign up to subsidize the costs.

Since his plan didn't do that, it was never something even remotely possible.

Sure, the idea of universal health care seems set in reality on the surface, but anyone that actually did the research you want them to would know it was bullshit.

>Three, he was able to win against McCain who is a respectable politician...

This should be an even clearer signal how fucked the average US voter is. I mean, I can understand someone like Clinton losing to a guy peddling not much more than hope and change.

McCain losing to that though? If that didn't wake you up to what Americans really value, I'm not sure why the Trump election would be different.

>(who was hindered by Palin, I admit. Who looks like a really good choice compared to Trump, btw.)

That's some revisionist history, IMO. 

He picked Palin ~2 months before election day. At that point, the election was pretty much already decided. Sure, maybe it increased the margin of defeat, but he was going down at that point no matter what. 

>I'm not able to help a person who has a higher education and far more experience than me and who is able to afford high class advisors and still makes mistakes like that.

"As GunnerMcGrath wrote, ""To steal is to unlawfully deprive a good possessor of property of that property""

Intellectual property is .... wait for it.... PROPERTY.
If a person or group has a patent on that property and you take it without permission, then you are stealing it. You have some pretty bizarre reality of your own, claiming that because there is no transfer of money when you duplicate information that there is no harm. If you duplicate information without paying for it, then you have deprived the owner of money. By saying no transfer, no problem, is effectively disregarding patents which would allow any company or group or individual to copy information and products from anyone without reprocussion. This would limit investment to large enough groups that can control products, which is why we have patents.

>Considering there is no historical Islam in Britain, and that the main centres of the Islamic world are on another continent, there is nothing strictly logical about the presence of many Muslims in Britain.

Why not worth it? Your defense of that statement is logical nonsense. To say they have no history here, despite them in fact being here, does indeed imply your view of Britishness must have some static, historical (your own words), quality excluding Islam. I asked you to date that historical quality and argued I can redefine the nation on the basis of what break points I chose. You weaseled, denied making that point (that Islam is not historical to Britain). Your incapacity on the point and weaseling made me realize there's nothing to add further.

For what its worth, your point about Anglicanism being a native process might hold, although then if you read my links about CUKC citizenship, to redefine citizenship/britishness to include the colonies by an act of parliament, was a native process also...

A lot of conservatives voted Hillary or abstained. Trump won because of the electoral college and gerrymandering not because of libertarians.

> Is it maybe that actually the practical libertarian position is to enrich themselves by slashing taxes on the wealthy and cut benefits for others (who, incidentally, don't particularly look like those libertarians either)

The leading libertarian who got the farthest in the last election was Austin Peterson. He calls for a 1% across the board cut in government spending. That's hardly a radical self enriching position.

> while not giving a single fuck about the civil liberties of those folks that, again, incidentally don't seem to look like them?

Libertarians believe in civil liberties they just don't believe in giving the government money and power to create civil liberties. A government this is bloated with military contracts and special programs creates enormous inequalities in society.

It's not that this would ""ruin the fun of killing noobs"", that does not reflect my reasoning on why implementing a speed boost would be disastrous for starve. It is that newer players would have a significant speed advantage over other players who have survived for more than 10 days. Lower ranked people are already capable of killing full gear players, especially when they team up. A couple of fresh spawns with stone swords can take out a full gear player. This is not a problem though because the higher level player can use walls to escape if he is close to dying.

If this speed boost were added the leader would be the one struggling to escape, since the attackers could just boost into him or boost around the walls. Plus, random players watching the leader being chased would be able to join the fight much easier now by boosting in.

Touching on the flawed reasoning for adding the speed boost in the first place...

>""but if another player decides to kill you, there's very little that can be done in terms of escaping, yet alone retaliating.""

This shows a lack of knowledge in starve's pvp options, which is surprising seeing as it is not that advanced. If you are playing a skilled player who has full gear while you only have gold, then it can be challenging to escape, but not unreasonably so. A few well placed walls allow for successful evasion, and if the top player is unskilled he can be killed by using bandages, retreating to heal, and then attacking again. Plus spikes can still get the job done too, it is just harder to kill with them than before."

I am only saying that if it visually overrepresented the absolute numbers of Russians in Estonia, we could debate whether this is a problem.

> it was a Soviet government-organized Russification policy to swamp Estonia with Russians. Please learn your history before you blabber and defend a sick regime like that!

I am not defending the regime—what it did was completely wrong. I am saying that you do not undo wrong by doing more wrong.

A similar thing happened in the Czech Republic after World War II. Germans living in the so-called Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia (who have lived there for generations) were expelled (and many of them killed) just because they were Germans. No-one cared about whether they supported Hitler or fought against him, whether they had anything to do with the war or whether they even wanted to be part of Germany. Czechs hated Germans, so it was the ""right thing"" to expel all Germans from our land. It was an insanely racist policy on the Czech part.

Even now most Czechs would tell you that it was the right thing to do, because they ""were German"", the ""occupiers"". I am sorry fellow Czechs, but that's a typical example of racism.

> Russians being here is a result of racism from the Soviet Union.

Yes, as a result of racism of totalitarian leaders. But most ethnic Russians in Estonia had nothing to do with the racism. They are normal people who spent their entire lives there and just want to live in peace.

> so many hostile foreigners

And that's the root of the problem. For you, Russians are just ""hostile foreigners"". But most of them (like most of the people in any developed country) just want to live a normal life.

You could be a bilingual country profiting from having Russian speakers in terms of trade, with a constitution that makes sure that there is never going to be any kind of russification of the Estonian majority. But you choose to discriminate the minority instead and make them feel unwelcome in the country they grew up in.

> And Russia still has leverage to sometimes get their word in, so that useful idiots like you could quote the misleading and factually incorrect reports.

Neymar at 21 had a worse season than Mbappe at 18 in his first season in Barca. Brazil league is very good but no way close to the competition in Europe and CL. Also he played in their provincial league too which is probably as bad as 3rd level competition in Europe. 
Hazard at 18 had 6 goals and 4 assists! Better than Mbappe my ass! He also didn't have better stats than Mbappe neither as 19 yo, nor as 20 and 21 yo. He has also never shined as much as Mbappe in CL in his whole career. 
Leo Messi as an 18 yo had 9 goals and 8 assists. At 19 he had 17 goals and 4 assists and at 20 he had 16 goals and 16 assists. He wasn't as clinical as Mbappe was when he was 18 though it's pretty clear that the chance of Mbappe reaching Messi's level is pretty slim and close to 0. "

Not really: no. Here is the specific statement:

>>This is how Bronze Age local war gods behaved. Not as the result of ontological proofs, but as sometimes befuddled sky wizards.

Bronze Age: ""The Bronze Age is the period 3300-1200 BCE when objects made of bronze were in use. Many writers have linked the history of the Levant from the Bronze Age onwards to events described in the Bible. The Bronze Age and Iron Age together are sometimes called the ""Biblical period""""

War God: ""Yahweh, prior to becoming Yahweh, the national god of Israel, and taking on monotheistic attributes in the 6th century BCE, was a part of the Canaanite pantheon in the period before the Babylonian captivity. Archeological evidence reveals that during this time period the Israelites were a group of Canaanite people. Yahweh was seen as a war god, and equated with El. Asherah, who was often seen as El's consort, has been described as a consort of Yahweh in numerous inscriptions.[1] The name Yahwi may possibly be found in some male Amorite names.[2] Yahu may be found in a place name.""

You said that these are tired /r/atheismrebooted claims, but they are actually the scholarly consensus as documented in Wikipedia and elsewhere. If you are so far down the rabbit hole that you plug your ears when the scholars speak then this conversation has a 99.999% chance of being futile. I could have the same conversation with a Muslim fundamentalist and he also would deny any scholarship which was inconvenient to his point.

I start from a different place. I sacralize truth. I will burn any belief on the alter of truth. One of those beliefs was my childhood Christianity. 

Yes: my arguments will be old. Not tired, but old. Christianity has a 2000 year tradition of offering inadequate responses to the simplest questions: 

 • where did God come from (no I do not accept bullshit about Yaweh being a necessary being)

 • why does God not speak simply and clearly in a manner that everyone can understand, as he did when he spoke to Moses and Noah (the free will rebuttal to this makes no sense)

 • why did God not directly write a simple and clear book of instructions instead of a meandering, confusing, self-contradictory mess which looks even less coherent than the Koran of the Book of Mormon to an objective reader?

 • why did God create cancer, tornados, AIDS, hurricanes? (As is typical you answered ""why not"" rather than why)

• why does God need ""pets?""

 • why would morality consist of a pet obeying its master?

 • why does the Bible contradict both science and archeology?


 • why does the Bible contradict common sense? ""How do you know that Harry Potter is fiction? Because there is a talking snake in the first few pages."" I could list hundreds of ridiculous things in the Bible, from God sending bears to maul children to Jesus cursing fig trees. It is a hilarious book of myths.

And so forth. It would be a total waste of time for me to come up with new arguments when these ones have no convincing response yet.

>What do you think I believe in regards to authorship of the Bible? It was inspired, the authors were inspired to write this, and as our theological deductions have progressed we can come to understand the nature of God.

There is no convincing evidence that the Bible was inspired. Quite the opposite. It's first chapter reads exactly like the creation myth of the Haida or any other pre-scientific society.

>Throughout the entire Bible God speaks using rhetorical devices. When we do so, it's usually to make a point, and this is what happens in the garden, because as we'd previously seen Adam had sinned. Adam had destroyed his fellowship with God and He was pointing this out to him.

You are starting from your conclusion. ""God is omniscient, so whenever he asks where are you he must be speaking rhetorically."" This is incredibly intellectually dishonest. I approach it the opposite way. ""There is a being. The being asks where other beings are. Therefore the being does not have omniscience."" That's the objective third party reading of the text.

If I read the phone book with the idea that it is the word of god, I can find any message in there that I want. That's what you are doing; imposing your theology on the text to avoid grappling with the clear and true meaning of the writers. Just as it would be a waste of time for me to try to convince a paranoiac that there is no message in the phone book...

>Yes, the problem of suffering. Are you serious?

Why would I not be serious? Your church has failed miserably at solving this problem for 2000 years.

> Where in the Bible are we told that the purpose of the universe's existence is to merely provide a comfortable home for God's pets? 

Exactly! Now you are catching on!

A pet owner who does not do everything possible to relieve extreme suffering on a pet's part would be evil. In fact, to knowingly inflict pain on a pet would be not just illegal but immoral. And yet God in enter cancer and tsunamis. So he is immoral. So he is not perfect. So he is not the God predicted by Christianity or the ontological proof. I can imagine a greater being: one that does not invent and then unleash smallpox.

> Perhaps the repeated reminder that this creation is temporary might shed some light on that.

No it does not. It is a total non-sequiteur. Suffering happens in the present moment. An omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent God could achieve his long term goals without inflicting suffering in the present. The fact that he cannot figure out how to do so demonstrates that he lacks at least one of those traits.

>Mmm, yes, the problem of evil. Shocking.

Your rhetorical tricks just weaken your point. Yes, these are old arguments. And yet you still have no logically consistent response to them.

> This ties in with my previous explanation, and the question is, why would God remove these catalysts? That doesn't sound like freewill when we can't do anything to the contrary. 

What are you talking about. I could murder someone right now. But I have no inclination to do it. What kind of twisted definition of free will are you using whereby the fact that some people have voices in their head telling them to kill, or over-active violence modules in their brain gives those people MORE free will than me? 

According to your bizarre theory, the fact that I am not attracted to the opposite sex constitutes a lack of free will, but the temptation of the homosexual constitutes a presence of it. This is exactly the opposite of any logical or common sense position. The presence of faulty (from a Christian sin perspective) brain modules represents an INFRINGEMENT of free will. My non-violent nature allows me to have greater free will than people that I know who are the opposite.

> The purpose of creating a temporal existence is to eradicate these evils and to give agents the ability to come into union with God, to do so merely removing the temptation isn't going to do well in the long run, people would have to learn that those activities are bad and repent (change of mind).

Not a word of that makes the slightest bit of sense.

I am not attracted to having sex with children. You are saying that my lack of temptation is ""not going to work out well in the long term"" because I ""won't learn that these activities are bad and repent?""

According to you I have been deprived of an educational opportunity?

"I get that you're trying to help, but it's clear you haven't studied linguistics and don't know what you're talking about.

This is universal grammar. It's a major theory in linguistics. It is not the same thing as syntactic, morphological, and phonological differences between languages.

> Pope Francis even made allowances for European politicians who have completely closed their borders to immigrants, saying that politicians have a right to exercise prudence in such decisions.

> “So what do I think of those who close their borders?” Francis asked. “I think that in theory no one should close their heart to a refugee, but those who govern must also exercise prudence. They should be very open to receiving them, but they should also calculate how they will be able to settle them, because a refugee must not only be welcomed, but also integrated.”

> “And if a country is only able to integrate 20, let’s say, then it should only accept that many. If another is able to do more, let it do more,” he said. 

Look at that! Turns out the Pope didn't actually say that nations are obliged to take in every single person who tries to emigrate. Turns out, he was using one of the central stories from the Bible to remind us that caring for strangers is important in Christianity. He has also taken in refugees himself.

It is important, however, that you are not viewed as expressing negativity, but reporting on things that ought to be done for the good of the company. You could also try to get a discussion with management about apparent culture of dereliction of duty within your team and/or suggest that they start requiring some accurate reports from your team on percentage availability of critical services during business hours and progress on some major projects such as ""Phasing out old versions of Windows server"".

 If you're talking about leaving, then you have already given up.

Ultimately; you don't need a whole lot of buy-in from colleagues, you need buy-in mostly from management, as in it would be best to have a meeting where management would tell your team that failing to update systems is unacceptable. 

Things that need to be done to monitor critical infrastructure and achieve basic visibility should also definitely be reported, as IT cannot efficiently do their job proactively and keep the business running without them.

"I agree with you. Want to know why many Republicans got in line and voted for Trump even if they didn't like him? To protect the Supreme Court. They knew that the next President is likely to decide the SCOTUS for the next generation; whether it swings left or right. 

But our side? Nah. We're too busy playing purity politics. Too busy looking for a candidate that 100% fits what we want and believe. Nevermind that Clinton had the most progressive and comprehensive policy platform of any Presidential candidate to date. She was too ""establishment"". Too this, too that.

These people only thought as far as tearing down Hillary Clinton & the Democratic Party. They lacked the foresight to see the consequences to the things we all actually wanted to accomplish.

There's this thing called ""strategic voting"". It's a concept some of them may want to learn for the future. They could have had 80-90% of what they wanted, while holding Clinton's feet to the fire to push her farther left....now we all get 0% of what we wanted. 

The worst part is, in re-building the Democratic party will likely move towards the center. Not farther left. In fact, campaigns tend to pivot towards the center going into the general because the majority of the electorate is in the center. 

This was our shot. Our opportunity. But some of you didn't fall in love with the messenger. So you screwed us all.

For one thing, FPS is an umbrella term to describe the mechanics of gameplay - namely the viewport(first person) and how the user interact with the world(shooting). There are endless possibilities to explore within the FPS genre.

Its entirely possible for two games to be FPS games and not directly competing. Its also possible for two games to be FPS and directly competing. The descriptor is too broad to really tell us anything meaningful about the games.

The BR game style is different. Its very very specific. If Epic had just made a shooter game there would almost certainly not be an issue - because the game wouldn't be competing directly with PUBG. They didn't just make a shooter game. 

They made an almost exact gameplay replica of PUBG whilst also supplying an engine to PUBG.

I didn't realise I was talking to someone who is smarter than Isaac Newton. And Aristotle. And Erasthonese. And Pliny et. al. If only we had you 500 years ago. I look forward to your PhD thesis on the topic.

As I said you sound dangerously like how a Trump supporter sounds, and there are a lot of parallels. Let me make a guess... you don't read Christian books or websites, instead you spend your time reading Dawkins, Hitchens, listening to things like ""The Scathing Atheist"" and spend time watching Penn Gilette and Dawkins on youtube. In short, you are living in an atheist echo-chamber. No wonder you are so abrasive and aggressive with your views.

You mention Popper et. al. yet they are a very recent addition, coinciding with a general drop in the teaching of philosophy, making views like his (that have been around since the Greeks) float to the surface. Popper even said himself that he had no time for metaphysics... well no wonder he doesn't understand religion. That would be like asking someone who has never studied Physics to understand the Standard Model. It would sound crazy to them. Now imagine how String Theory or Quantum Chromodynamics sounds to someone without the prerequisite years study.

And before you pull out the tired trope ""well philosophy is nonsense"", reflect on the fact that mathematics is a subset of philosophy. Philosophical proofs have the same logical force as mathematical ones... and a rigorous study of metaphysics has the existence of God pop out surprisingly naturally. As long as the prerequisite study to understand the arguments has taken place first.

Yes many religious people are only following what their parents told them to do... but does that make religion itself unsound? There are equally many people who like and trust Physics, yet would have no clue how to prove the Biot-Savart law.

Embark on a period of serious study yourself, at least a couple of years. If you are so sure of yourself then what do you have to lose? You will come out the other side knowing more than you do now and that is always a good thing. Or you can return to the echo chamber. "
"> Thus why I said ""usually.""

If you agree that this was an exception, then it probably wasn't the best place to take a stand on this.

> ""In no way""? No way at all? Wow, you have to be kidding me.

No, you're just not very good at detail, especially when you're ranting. Your assertion which I confronted was specifically about ""parroting the brainless Shareblue/establishment narrative"".

What u/Uhillbilly does is neither brainless nor parroting: he selectively picks small nuggets from what you claim, perhaps correctly, is a ShareBlue-compromised site to use to denigrate Trump and associated minions and/or Republicans in entirely appropriate ways which do not support (other than by being to a reasonable degree true) the enveloping ShareBlue narrative's propaganda.

I don't waste my time paying close attention to ShareBlue's crap, but my impression is that its 'narrative' includes considerably more than merely beating on Trump and his flying monkeys - e.g., RUSSIA!!! (with all its accompanying detail like its having cost Hillary the election as 'proved' by all 13 of our infallible intelligence agencies - or at least a dozen members hand-picked from 3 of them in the best Cheney tradition - even more solidly than than Trump's treason which only has the support of mostly retired members of those agencies who can afford to shoot off their mouths without much fear of consequences but of course that's surely sufficient, its 'invasion' of Ukraine, the careful avoidance of inconvenient facts such as our contribution to its 2014 coup using neo-Nazis, drastic NATO eastward expansion after the agreement that this would not occur...) and I suspect more than passing mention of how fanciful progressive proposals are, pleasant as they may sound.

ShareBlue has its filthy fingers in a whole lot of pies, but the only pie u/Uhillbilly is interested in is the Trump pie and as noted he nibbles fairly selectively even on that one.

> I have no problem with that, I feel the same way.

Then that's one less obstacle to clear.

> Not from my perspective, or anyone else paying close attention to everything associated with ""Russiagate""

Your perspective is seriously warped in this area: nothing whatsoever that u/Uhillbilly posted in your list had anything significant to do with 'Russiagate', which though it began as a CYA effort to cover Hillary's incompetence is now primarily concerned with genning up fear and loathing toward Russia to benefit the general neocon agenda, the MIC, and curtailment of civil liberties and touches upon possible Trump collusion only relatively tangentially as a two-fer.

> The content, and sheer amount of it at times from certain places, is what I have an issue with.

I'll suggest that the latter is what dominates your reaction, and there's a very simple way to test that: imagine that you had no idea where these memes came from and how that might have affected your reaction (it might or might not have made any of them seem funnier to you, but I strongly suspect that your strong negative reaction would have been significantly moderated).

I'll also suggest that you might have been a great deal less picky about whether they scrupulously held to the absolute truth rather than improvised around it for humorous effect (it might be a useful exercise for you to see how much more stringent u/LoneStarMike59's work is in this area: I certainly haven't looked at it with this in mind so it well may be, but my guess would be that he's often willing to stretch a bit in order to improve the joke).

> You must be easily amused as I didn't find any of the posts humorous in the least. ""All but one"" being ""at least modestly funny"" makes no sense to me as there are two serious ones (contraceptive and immigrants posts) I can't understand seeing any humor in at all.

Wow - you must be great fun at parties. I can see humor (at least if one includes irony, which may explain why you don't see any humor in the two 'serious' posts you cite) in just about anything (which some people might consider politically incorrect, not that I give a damn), though I do differentiate based upon how well it's presented (which is why I liked the two 'serious' posts the best).

> Not when it's warranted.

> And especially not on the occasions when no one else steps up to challenge illegitimate/unsupportable Shareblue-friendly garbage.

And when would that be, exactly? In most such instances where u/Ignix has spewed his spam the comments it responds to seem to have been appropriately down-voted and often responded to individually (i.e., in a manner that addresses their specific improprieties).

> Where the fuck did you get me saying we shouldn't criticize Trump?

That was the only rational explanation I could come up with for your diatribe. I hadn't at that point realized that you were suffering from the same ShareBlue Derangement Syndrome that u/Ignix has contracted. Perhaps we should all learn a new language so that we can avoid being contaminated by using any of the words that the ShareBlue sites use.

Well, I've got more important things to do than continue this. Hope you get your mind back soon."
">You've made this assumption absolutely without any reason.

I have very good reason to make the assumption. Namely, almost no one disagrees that there are objects which exist objectively. Subjective idealism is an extreme minority position in philosophy and certainly not a common sense view. But even if the comment was in favor of subjective idealism, that would still make subjectively existing objects a subset of existing objects, just no longer a proper subset. Thus, I maintain my position that I have in no way ""given a counterexample for a subset of his claim without saying anything about the rest"". I gave examples of objects which are thought about, but have no existence regardless of qualifiers attached and subjective existence is a subset of existence.

Actually, I will note at this point that you seem to have given up talk of the subset relation completely in your most recent comment. Is that because you realized you were wrong or you got hung up in my one assumption and forgot about it?

"The article provides a very simplified and missing history of Intelligence that stops short of Alfred Binet. That would sort of be like me writing an article criticizing Psychology and stopping after talking about Freud. 

The article dismisses the past 90 years of research and changes made to ways intelligence is measured. The article ignores that there are numerous tests used to measure intelligence. The article ignores that most psychologists do not consider IQ to be dogma or a measure of one's ""self-worth."" 

The article doesn't provide any meaningful sources to back up huge claims like this:
>Since then, intelligence testing hasn’t gotten a lot better. The tests have gotten less culturally biased and less dependent on language skills. But they depend ultimately on the same assumptions: Intelligence is something that can be measured and quantified. 

There are actually studies done within the Psychological community looking at race and IQ tests. I think you would be surprised to find that not only do most psychologists agree that some of these IQ tests favor privileged groups, they would agree that a measure of intelligence does not capture everything that a person has to offer.

"> As a colored person myself, you are completely wrong. The ""joke"" always served the purpose of mocking those who were and are being brutalized by the police. 

I will absolutely not doubt your personal negative experience with the meme, which is very unfortunate and I can do nothing about. However, if you google ""stop resisting,"" the vast majority of results aren't showcasing black people at all, they're showcasing police brutality.

The top linked youtube result is """"STOP RESISTING!!"" Cops going crazy"" vs a white dude, the top Google images are an incapacitated white man with a gun pointed at him, a cartoon of Lady Justice being beaten by a cop, a bunch of protestors of mixed races being detained by cops, an image of a cop beating a black man with the text ""The decline of civilization will be carried out by those who are just doing their jobs,"" a (fake) image of a cop beating a white child, an image of a cop pepper-spraying a white woman, a cartoon of two cops deciding whether to shoot a puppy or beat it with nightsticks first, etc. Absolutely zero pro-authoritarian imagery. Don't take my word for it, google it for yourself.

Again, not trying to diminish the impact of whatever you've come into contact with, but I think your experience has been very polarized. In my experience, I have only ever seen the ""stop resisting"" meme used to deplore the kind of abuse of authority that made it infamous. Just because some asshole somewhere is using this meme for evil doesn't mean we can't use it for good. Apparently, white supremacists loved the Angry Birds movie and wanted everyone to see it. That doesn't mean it's theirs now and we have to stay away.

Actually, there are already quite a few references to Orisa's cop-like behavior in the game. For one thing, her Halt emote/victory pose is very reminiscent of street cops. Her ""No parking"" line is pretty clearly representative of cops, and ""for your safety, please move behind the barrier"" sounds like a very cop thing to say as well.

Modern was a solution to the recurring problem of people wanting to be able to play with lots of cards, but not the really broken early cards. Standard was created so you could play competitive Magic without Power. After it rotated far enough away from the old cards, Extended was created so that you could play with the earliest blocks and still play without Power. Then Extended also rotated away. Overextended would have been patch number three, and it wouldn't have stayed interesting for long. (Extended sucked from the first time it rotated. Everyone knew this. There was not much reason to think it wouldn't happen to Overextended.)

The choice of where to put the startpoint for Modern was obviously up for debate, but the basic idea of a non-rotating format that didn't start at the beginning was rock-solid and a much, much better idea than creating yet another rotating format that didn't actually solve the problem it wanted to.

And of the points they could have placed the start, this was the only one that was intuitive and excluded sets on the Reserve List. (Starting at the first sets designed as a block, Mirage, would be the other potential Schelling point.)

Or the other, very similar question, why is God not held to the same standard of good / evil as every other being? Why does he get to allow (or occasionally directly perpetrate) evil actions, and yet remain blameless?


It's not even necessary that you answer the questions (and I actually would rather you didn't, as that would just be a further step down this tangent), because I simply don't accept any definition of evil that does not include some of God's actions as evil.


Rather than have you (or anyone else) argue with me and rehash millenia old arguments, I'd rather you just see it how I see it, even if you don't agree (although I find a disagreeing viewpoint rather ridiculous, although coincidentally, one that I used to hold myself as a christian)"
"Let's see if I can explain this in terms Trump supporters can understand. 

NK has been on a nuclear path since the 1960's when it became clear that any country without a nuclear arsenal was up for grabs. The USRR was expanding like crazy and the US was starting wars in Southeast Asia one after the other. 

NK is about the size of Indiana and its GDP (that's size of economy) is smaller than Vermont (the smallest economy in the US).

If you are scare of that, I guess all the bravado about US might is just a sham. 

The US has more than 37K troops in South Korea and the ability to destroy that tiny country with conventional warfare at ANY time. 

There's ZERO need for nuclear bombing anywhere in the world. 

Now if you want to understand fault, here's a very long history lesson for you. I'll give a cheat sheet: Things always get much worse with NK after some (R) idiot enters the WH and fucks up diplomacy. 
___________

The NK nuclear program can be traced back to about 1962. After several failed tentatives to get the USRR and China to help them they finally began to operate facilities for uranium fabrication and conversion, and conducted high-explosive detonation tests during the REAGAN administration.

During the Clinton administration the US started a framework facilitate the supply of two light water reactors to North Korea in exchange for North Korean disarmament. Such reactors were considered ""more proliferation-resistant than the existing North Korea's graphite-moderated reactors"".

During the BUSH administration the agreement fell apart (when Bush famously coined the idiotic axis of evil) and not only NK stopped collaborating with the US, they also withdrew from the NTP (Nuclear Proliferation Treaty).

On October 9, 2006, North Korea announced it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test. Again, during the BUSH administration."

Nope. It's just that every class who contests against him has been nerfed since launch.

You can care about women's rights and issues without buying into an ideology like feminism. 

>That said, I do think that they can coincide with one another

I don't think they can. I think feminism's core belief is Patriarchy, and that's a half-truth which nothing but more half-truths can spring from. Feminism is built on the belief that society benefits men at the expense of women, and the reality is that gender roles benefit those who obey them and punish those who don't; it's omnidirectional. Most feminist issues happen just as much to men, or similar things happen to men, but the issues are framed as if only women suffer. This blinders-on thinking is what separates feminism from the MRM. Most of the time, I see MRAs acknowledging female victims but saying male victims exist too.

In order to coexist, we would need a Women's Rights Movement similar in structure to the MRM; upfront about its goals without any dogma. Also, without pretending that their movement is about ""equality"" while only ever taking action on behalf of one side.

>I've never really experienced oppression just for being a man.

You probably have, but were told it was normal. Though it's possible you haven't. I've compared men and women's problems to the death of a thousand cuts vs. a dropped piano. Women's issues tend to be the constant awareness of small things that erode your confidence and personhood. Men's issues tend to be a big horrible thing that falls in your lap all at once.

This is hilarious to me. Your complaint was roads are expensive. But now that we've shown roads are cheap, your complain is that roads are too cheap? Would you prefer we spend more money on roads?.

Michigan legislators purposefully starve Michigan infrastructure of funding (this is true across most everything, including roads, transit, schools, etc). So Michigan builds roads to 20 year standards (instead of say, 30 or 50 year ones), to save costs. Michigan could build better quality roads, but no one is willing to pay for it, 20 year are considered 'good enough' 

That is not my opinion -- that all comes from MDOT itself, in the PDF I linked to in the previous post.

">Sun Tzu claimed he could create an army out of this ruler's harem.

You actually have the story/parable reversed. In the ""job interview"", it was the king who (paraphrasing) said that if Sun Tzu was as competent/badass as he claimed to be, then he should be able to train the king's harem into a company of soldiers. So it was the king who forced him into that position. Sun Tzu specifically appointed the king's favorite concubines as the commanders, and they were the ones who were executed. This was done over the king's protests, as Sun Tzu indicated that a king's orders (you know, the whole ""turn my whores into warriors"") were paramount, and thus illustrates another, oft-overlooked point: that a king should not carelessly throw away the lives of those under his command.

Incidentally, this story was recorded by ""historian"" Sima Qian, who was born about three centuries after Sun Tzu died. I'm pretty sure you can figure out how I feel about the veracity of this story. Either that, or you believe every word of what Marco Polo said about China.

>Another is putting troops on ""death ground,"" which is in the Art of War. 

Wow. Not only did you take what he said out of context, you just pretty much demonstrated what Sun Tzu cautioned against too.

""Death ground"" is the ninth of nine tactical scenarios that he said all battlegrounds could be generally classified into. He did point out that when facing almost certain death, soldiers would fight harder. He also did say that it may be tactically advantageous to put troops into a situation where fighting was the only choice that could be made, as (here's your context) desertion was a very serious problem in those days.

What he did not advocate was always intentionally throwing your men into hopeless situations, as doing so would be ""mass suicide"" (see: whore-iors). That would run entirely counter to what he said just a few maxims before about watching out for the well-being and morale of one's troops and that they should not be overtaxed."

This doesn't mean people don't still have a reason to run the raid. Lots of times people go back and try for achievements equal to ""flawless raider"" or try the raid with a smaller group of people or only using certain types of guns or no-exotics.

It is still a viable way for people to get gear on their way to 32, learn mechanics and working as a team if they just got the game, and the only way so far to get elemental weapons which still kick more ass against shielded mobs then the new buffed up guns.

$1000/month for food? There are (presumably) 3 of you, and one of you is a small child (because otherwise the $2000/month you pay for childcare would be a complete waste). When my family had foreign exchange students living in the house there were a total of 6 of us, all pretty much fully grown. My parents paid $600/month on food for the 6 of us, and it's not like we didn't eat well. We went out to eat usually once every other week and everything.

$4000/vacation. WASTE OF MONEY. My sister and her husband went to san fransisco and stayed in a beautiful home for an entire week and only spent $1200 total. Most of that was for airfare. They considered this splurging.

$400/month on gas? What the fuck? I commute an hour to work and an hour back 5 days a week, sometimes 6, and have a $150/month gas budget. That is straight up nonsense. Either that brand new car you are paying for is a fucking gas guzzler, in which case you are an idiot for wasting all that money, or that's a straight up lie.

$250/month on clothes!?!?!??!!?!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK!?!? I don't even spend $250/year on clothes.

$400/month on Children's Lessons? How many things are they learning!? I took Guitar and Piano lessons when I was in high school and only paid $120/month total. All you have to do is research good places that are cheap, and they are everywhere.

So, let's talk about the savings you could be making.

Stop eating fucking caviar ($6000 saving)

Don't waste shit on vacations ($6000 saving)

Get a different fucking car ($2800 saving)

Don't buy new clothes every fucking day ($2500 saving)

Learn to fucking research before just paying ($2500 saving)

All that adds up to almost $20,000/year you are wasting. And you would STILL be living an incredible life in a $700,000 house with a brand new car, having your child going to meaningless lessons, paying for someone else to take care of your child, going on 2 awesome vacations a year, and maxing your 401k contributions. 

You know what you could do with that $20,000? You could live an ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE. This may be hard to understand for you, but people live with multiple children (like 4+) on $20,000/year, yet you have to fucking complain about your god damn perfect life making 10x that much when you don't even work 1/10 as hard as they do because you don't understand the meaning of a dollar."

"I think it's going to be interesting to see how long people play the multiplayer. The game is in a weird spot between old-school arena shooters and modern shooters. The arena-shooter fans already dislike how the game plays, and I really don't see there being enough unlockable content and ""progression"" to keep all of the modern-shooter fans playing for too long.

"Well, I don't think anyone confuses rape lit for something desirable. It makes no attempt to normalize that behavior. FSOG attempts to normalize abusive behavior within the context of BDSM. Bodice rippers don't get this kind of attention because none of them have exploded in such popularity, garnering attention from people who would never read about BDSM or even just plain vanilla bodice rippers. Had any of them been that popular, and populated with abusive ""heart throbs"", I'm sure it would have gotten similar attention.

I don't think getting the word out about FSOG is the same about bitching about genocide at Thanksgiving, because there are plenty of people who don't know that Grey is romanticized rapist and whose behavior is not only not acceptable writ large, but also not acceptable in the BDSM community.

All I'm saying is that the book is the shit, the author very likely didn't know the relationship she was describing is actually horrendously abusive, and that people should let people know just how shit the character of Grey is. No book burnings, no doxxing, none of that. 

Feel free to protest at the theater if you like, but I imagine a more effective way to do it would be to hand out pamphlets citing examples of Grey's abuse from the book/film with an accompanying description of how that behavior constitutes abuse or rape (from a reputable source, like RAINN), and end the pamphlet with some contact information for places people can reach out to (help hotlines, websites, women's shelters, etc).....rather than screaming SMASH THE PATRIARCHY WARRRRRRRRRRGHLLLLLLLARGBLEBARGLE"
"> Potential and kinetic energy are not the only kinds of energy, in fact they aren't even real forms of energy in the first place.

So potential and kinetic energy aren't really energy? Please read up on this topic.

> Your examples of the moon and space shuttle are oversimplifications that you might find in a class room.

But this is a classroom -- it must be, because you don't understand the topic. You think the energy of motion isn't ""real"" energy.

> In the real world they are much more complicated.

Yes, true, but since you don't understand the simple version, it's too soon for the complications of the real world.

> We weren't talking about energy in the first place anyway. We were talking about acceleration.

Yes, a distinction without a difference. Please read the following points:

 In Newton's First Law, motion changes because of applied accelerations.

 Accelerations require force.

 Force is the time derivative of momentum.

 Momentum represents potential energy.

With me so far?

> An object in circular/non-linear motion is accelerating due to a force that is preventing it from moving along a path of linear motion...

That is not acceleration. An acceleration involves a change in potential energy. Rotation doesn't involve such a change, and linear motion doesn't either. Rotation is not acceleration.

>> Only to start or stop the rotation. In the absence of friction, the rotation itself doesn't require any kinetic energy.

> No. The entire time. If that force is removed the object would resume a path of linear motion...

If you have an weight rotating on the end of a string, and you cut the string, the weight's motion changes from rotational to linear with no change in energy.

If you have a weight moving in a linear path, and you hook it with a string, the weight's motion changes from linear to rotational with no change in energy.

The fact that a weight is rotating doesn't require more or less energy than a weight moving in a straight line. Consider this:

 A weight rotates at the end of a string with some potential energy e, a consequence of its mass and its rotational velocity (its momentum).

 The weight is released from the string and travels in a straight line, maintaining all its potential energy.

 The weight is captured by another string and commences rotating with the same rotational velocity that it had during the first rotation.

The rotational velocity and potential energy of the second orbit is identical to that of the first -- no energy needs to be added to or removed from the system.

> or in the case of an object in orbit under the influence of gravity it might cause the object to fall into the object it is orbiting.

So according to the above, if we have a weight suspended over a planet, not under the influence of gravity but held in orbit with a string (let's say the planet isn't massive enough to sustain the orbit), and if we cut the string, the object will fall onto the planet?

 An object that is traveling in a straight line continues to do so because of inertia (Newton's First Law), with no change in energy and no accelerations.

 An object that is rotating continues to do so because of inertia (Newton's First Law), with no change in energy and no accelerations.

With respect to potential and kinetic energy, the two cases are equivalent.

They put out a statement, ""After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.""

In addition, the Climategate 2.0 emails clearly show how there is much uncertainty and doubt within the climate community about the science, doubt which is never shown publicly because a few ringleaders control the dessimination of information.

The climate community is not operating as a scientific community, sir. It's acting as a political one. You can't ignore the evidence of this forever.

> ""The main statement publicized after the last IPCC Scientific Assessment two years ago was that it was likely that most of the warming since 1957 (a point of anomalous cold) was due to man. This claim was based on the weak argument that the current models used by the IPCC couldn't reproduce the warming from about 1978 to 1998 without some forcing, and that the only forcing that they could think of was man. Even this argument assumes that these models adequately deal with natural internal variability—that is, such naturally occurring cycles as El Nino, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, etc.""

> Yet articles from major modeling centers acknowledged that the failure of these models to anticipate the absence of warming for the past dozen years was due to the failure of these models to account for this natural internal variability. Thus even the basis for the weak IPCC argument for anthropogenic climate change was shown to be false.

You do know that the naturally occurring form of a substance is vastly different than the artificially processed form, right?"
"> and judging it based on who is willing to accept fast food in place of the cash they asked for is a pretty shitty way to go about it.

As I said: I dont bring cash with me. I figure that if Im serious about this, I should plan how I intend to help. And I've decided that the most reasonable and economical use of the resources I have available is to create care packs with food and dental goods (because who on the streets wants to spend $8 on dental care) and space blankets (because the weather is an actual threat). 

I can get that stuff at prices the homeless cannot-- I can get food in bulk and divy it up, and I can work with my dentist to get free dental care packs, and I can get bulk pricing on space blankets. THat means my $10 is going to hook 5 or so people up with care packs rather than one person.

At the end of the day, as a Christian, I think I will be accountable for how I live my life and how I used my resources. I think that means I should think about this carefully, determine what I have available to help the poor, and determine the best way to allocate that. I dont know that you or the homeless guy is really in a position to judge my finances or how much excess wealth I have. I could share for instance that I am in the middle of renovating a house that is in extremely poor condition (black mold, bad gutters), and that Im not exactly rolling in dough. Giving $10 to homeless people in lieu of food would mean that 2-3 people a month are getting handouts. Instead, I can budget for 30 or more care packs with that same money.

So if they find that patronizing, Im sorry. But since its my money, Im ultimately the one whos gotta make the calls on how its used.

>Helping homeless people is the default for moral behavior, and choosing not to give is immoral.

You really arent in a position to judge the state of my finances, nor am I prepared to share an accounting sheet with the amount I contribute to charity with you. I also dont think you're in a position to make that kind of absolute moral statement, because every situation is different and many shelters recommend that you not give money to the homeless.

>But labeling everyone who gets offended at your patronizing attitude a ""scammer"" isn't helpful.

You misunderstand if you think thats what Im doing. Im recognizing that free money handouts creates the worst kinds of incentives for folks who might be so inclined, whereas food handouts have substantially less negative incentive attached to them. 

>Wow, that's an incredibly privileged view of the situation. You know who in our society has the least ability to just ""go somewhere else""? Homeless people, of course. You may not be aware, but there are many areas prohibited to them. 

Im well aware of that problem, and of the problem of hostile architecture (benches with spikes so they cant sleep). And I think I could word that better but it seriously stinks to spend a significant amount of time and money on this problem and then have people get indignant that the time and effort I put in wasnt what they wanted.

I have no intention to go into the sum total of charity I offer; I dont do it so I can boast, or others can recognize me, or because I think I have to do it to be a good person. I do it because I care about the people, and want to help them, and that means that if you reject what Im offering my only feeling is (on a good day) that Im sorry I couldnt help you.

But it is my personal belief that handing out money has way more downside than up in most situations, so I simply dont do it. I dont think it helps (most of the time), I think its liable to create problems for me, the recipient, or society, and that there are way more effective ways to use that money."

There is not morality going away with religion. America is just doing the best it can do to uphold societal standards that ensure a quality of life. If religion being removed from schools, same-sex marriages, or abortions are your idea of morality being removed. I'd say that it is society maturing and growing up to deal with real issues.

The fact ahsoka left kanan alone with maul shows they were trying to make out kana an maul are at least roughly equals.

>Oh really? Frame calcs are inaccurate? Hmm maybe instead of doing that I should do what you did. Blindly assume the bolts shot at Ahsoka are bullet speed ""just because"" with no basis whatsoever. Except I won't because that's stupid. Why would you assume that?
Without frame calcing you have absolutely no basis as to the speed of the bolts. So what do I do? I measure how long it takes for the bolts to cross a particular distance over a particular time. It's simple math. There's nothing fancy done. If it takes a second to cross 5 meters, then it's moving at 5 meters per second. Of course there will be variations but all you need to do is take it like any other form of data. Average it out and discount outliers to provide yourself with a good estimate of the speed.

jesus dude didn't realise i'd hit a nerve... the fact it's simple maths and your finding an average is irrelevant as there is no way the animator measure it at all they'll just have it move across the screen at whatever looks best depending on how far the bolt is travelling ,the angle its moving in relation to the ""camera""and how far away the bolt is in relation to the ""camera"". they aren't going to try and keep them at any sort of consistent speed as long as it looks okay. Just because we have no official answer on how fast blaster bolts are compared to bullets in sw doesn't mean we should jump to some completely unreliable method. It's not like blaster bolts have to be even close to the speed of a bullet for anakin to be able to easily block the bullets one man can fire at him. Anakin stops blaster fire form 100s of droids at once regularly, he has precog, he has way beyond peak human speed and agility. It's absurd to think he'd be overwhelmed by just WS firing bullets at him.

>That's not a valid excuse. If force users have not shown to be FTE, then they're not FTE simple. You can't say ""oh they can move x speed but they slowed it down for us so we can see it"" without a basis. And as far as I know, there is no reason to assume that Star Wars battles are not in real time. I know that characters like Vader and other high-tier force users have moved FTE to other characters briefly but that doesn't mean they're always fighting at that speed.

Because the algorithms used only reflect what the humans behind them choose for them to reflect..and part of that is bias.

That bias can be seen in both YouTube and facebooks algorithm, that removes content deemed “hateful” or “problematic”.

This becomes a problem, because if the bias of the person running the algorithms decides anything that opposes there views falls into these categories..it gets censored.

This is just a personal observation, but from what I can see there is an incredible level of cognitive dissonance occurring here. I'm starting to think that people's pride is just too wrapped up in this whole thing to look at the rather alarming writing on the wall. 

These are guys who are old enough to have voted for Reagan and are proud to tell me so. But when I bring up Donny's somewhat alarming ties to Russia, they turn my own rhetoric on me, saying that I'm bigoted and afraid of a foreign power, even though I'm simply trying to connect the dots between what they once believed and what they are currently professing. 

But think about it this way; if you were part of what you perceived to be a political revolution, but it was slowly revealed that you were conned, it'd be an incredibly hard thing to accept. Duped by a spoiled brat with a bad comb over and a spray tan. A guy who embodies all the qualities they claim to hate about my generation (never worked with his hands, owes his success to his parents money, self obsessed social media diva) just got them all rallied behind him. How stupid would you feel if you were tricked by that guy of all people?

It doesn't matter what he does at this point. These guys were all about that wall. Trump slowly came to realize what a horrible idea that was. Backed down. They shrugged. Drain the swamp? He puts in Rex Tillerson as his pick for Secretary of State? No problem!

And on and on the dance goes. I understand why this is happening, but I don't know if I'm willing to forgive it at this point. I want to be rational. I want to understand the needs of my fellow citizens. But at a certain point, this tide of hatred and ignorance is going to become too much to bear or sympathize with. At some point this fight is going to stop being metaphorical. "
"As has been stated multiple times, the links I posted were to make the point that many studies in fact do exist and it took less than 10 seconds of typing to find that jumping off point.

I would consider the top reply to actually be spoon feeding which I have stated I won't do (I also noted a hint of snark in the reply, may just be me).

And just for the sake of spoon-feeding you guys info, protein S100B serum levels have been linked to ""neurite extension [...] and axonal proliferation"" and ""over the last decade, S100B has emerged as a candidate peripheral biomarker of blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability"", all of which are indirectly related to nootropics.

Also, Google Translate works relatively well."
"Why would you steal, destroy, or kill? Why not work for a living? Or are you so used to your violence that other's lives, liberty, or property don't matter? 


Entitled? You're a fucking joke! I've worked for EVERYTHING I have! I don't need to send out armed goons to collect my income for me. I offer individuals a service/product that they can chose to buy from me or not. 

Provide others huh? I employ over 40 people. Who do you provide for? 


If the tax feeders want revenue they should offer a service/product that individuals can chose to purchase if it fits their needs or not if it doesn't.

">She's not flaky. Have been in her position and made the same assumption (except mine was a third date).

She is, and so are you.

Or better, she, and you, are not interested in actually meeting someone. No, you're not. If you were, you'd not just cancel like that.

Just like guys, you need to take some risk. If i text you the day before, or the morning of the day we're supposed to meet, and you cancel on me, it's done. You're not seeing me (again).

Why? Because I'm clearly still interested - I didn't change my plans - But you're not. And sure as hell I'm not chasing someone who doesn't want to be chased. 

The lady who will actually be interested in meeting me will be enthusiastic about me not canceling. And so will I."
"I hope you realize that even when passing, you're not allowed to exceed the speed limit. So unless the person is right next to you, it's impossible to block the passing lane. Of course the entire concept of a passing lane is made up and there's actually no such thing as a passing lane. The left most lane is designed for through traffic, not for passing.

This is reddit though, where everyone is under 30 and no one knows the actual rules of the road let alone how to drive safely."
"Ahh, the good old ""it's your fault be tougher"" talk. I've had it so many times already. People like to believe in some kind of social darwinism world where everyone suffers only because they deserved it. I'm going to repeat it, though i don't think it will do any good.

First of all, shut up. Don't assume that i'm an incel or some shit just because i'm not fucking manly Dan.

Second, i'm gonna repeat it again. Fighting back doesn't work. It was proven a thousand times already. Most of the time it only makes situation worse, because you've raised the stakes. Also, authorities will fuck you up for it.

Finally, what makes you think that i haven't told anyone or haven't fought back? I did. I was telling everyone there fucking is. I fought back. I was beaten and humiliated, but i didn't let it get to me. I was fighting again and it always ended the same way. No one was helping me. No one was reacting. Everyone were looking the other way. When i fought back successfully, i was reprimanded, punished, shouted at. And more importantly, it haven't stopped anyone. When i snapped and went apeshit, it didn't scare the bullies, it didn't alert the others. It didn't work. 

You seem to think that your experience somehow applies to everyone else. I'm not going to pretend that there aren't people who had it the same you had. But there are far more people who had experience similar to mine or worse. It's all documented. It's researched by psychologists. I'm not just pulling shit out of my ass here. It's really easy to google. It's fucking awful, really. 

It all happened a long time ago. I try not to let it affect me, but bullying leaves huge nasty scars on psyche. And you can't just become tough and shake it off. Psychology doesn't work that way. Fixing it requires a lot of time and qualified help. I certainly don't want to remember all that only to argue with some dude on reddit, so i'll stop. You may think anything you want about me, but you won't change my mind. "
" You have demonstrated that you know nothing about the game. Nothing I said was incorrect based on that small gif that was provided. If the replay as a whole was there then it would be easy to say ""he should have done X,"" but since it wasn't I can only speculate. The only thing I know for certain was that zerg wasn't spending his money and thus didn't have enough units. I'm high diamond and I have played high diamonds and I can tell you High diamonds don't bank money like that. So the only one providing logical fallacies (be careful because you might hurt your self using big terms like that) is you. Besides you missed the entire point of my post which was making fun of the zerg player for blaming his entire loss on blizzard buffing the mines. If you watched any starcraft at all then you would know that there is such a thing as ""The mistake that cost him the game."" It happens all the time: Hellions get surrounded and killed by ling and he cant stop the all in. Blink stalkers snipe medivacs because the terran tried a doom drop for no reason, making too many drones after scouting/not scouting something. It happens all the time and casters talk about it after games. You hear it all the time ""X was really the moment that cost him the game. If had done Y instead he would have been fine. There was really no reason for him to do X."" Everything I am saying is coherent, but you are just not grasping any of it and then saying it is ""dumb shit."" It is very clear that you don't know much about the game because if you did you would have a solid argument, and you do not. (ps there is really no argument because as I said before I was making fun of the zerg for blaming it all on the mines. So I am not even sure why you are trying to contest anything)"
"But you ARE here to debate the morality of eating animals, when you ask why we should or should not eat an... animal. I'm sorry if you're mind is made up and you don't want to hear debate on the matter, but maybe CMV isn't the subreddit for you then? Cats and Dogs are animals and a debate about whether or not to eat them should be FULL, not artificially limited. Afterall people die every day, we could eat them as well, but we don't. The ethics and morality of eating people is something we take seriously, despite the fact that they are 'going to waste'. 

And you continue to go on about 'wasted' animals, when you've already delta'd somebody for explaining that isn't true. Again, very disingenuous.

And I think you need to realistically consider that if we make it a culturally customary practice to eat cats and/or dogs, that you've got to expect that people wil be more inclined to kill these animals for food. "
"At my time of comment it had no downvotes. Thus I've changed the quoted comment to a more appropriate one. I honestly don't care about karma, what I'm concerned about is that this is a perfect microcosm of the way in which the communities surrounding popular anime force out dissenting opinions."
