"> theories are constantly growing and evolving and self-correcting

Why would theories self-correct if they were already correct? They must have been incorrect previously, right? You don't take alter something that's already correct. You alter it because it was incorrect or wrong.

> when part of a theory is shown to be incorrect

> There might be some small piece that's incorrect

You said that. Not me. Not James-Cizuz. You said that parts of theories could be shown to be incorrect. So what should we call something that is, at least partly, incorrect. Surely we can't call it correct--not if it's partly incorrect. Say, here's a crazy idea, what if we call something that's incorrect--get this--WRONG. The two words are synonyms after all. Then it's all agreed: you said theories can be shown to be wrong and that's what James-Cizuz said. And now you don't have to be a condescending ""member of the scientific community.""

Just to drive this point home, let's take a look at the definition of ""wrong"":

> deviating from truth or fact; erroneous

A theory which is shown partly incorrect certainly deviates from truth. Therefore, by definition, it is wrong.

"> I think the whole point of this discussion was that acquiring wealth, no matter the form, is human nature. Stockpiling crops as insurance against a bad season is literally the manifestation of self preservation you find in all of nature. My comment was a joking rebuttal to yours.

Except the purpose of stockpiling grains was not to ""acquire wealth"". It was to ensure they didn't die during a bad harvest. Making something to use is not acquiring wealth. Wealth is measured by having an abundance of commodities. Having grains that are going to be used is not an abundance, it's a safe keeping. That's like saying a doomsday prepper is building wealth by keeping corn seeds in his basement. It doesn't work like that. 

>So why did you mention the following?

Because having an excess of something is not human nature. It's something that the elites of society do, and that people of the materialist culture of modern society do. That indicates that it is aristocrat culture, and bourgeois culture, not human nature. For something to be human nature, it has to be a defining feature of human action. But your proof of that is ancient grain stockpiles, which were not a source of wealth, but a safekeep. Wealth in those days was measured by owning land. 

>I don't need a wikipedia copy and paste of capitalism. 

It's not a copy and paste of capitalism. And apparently you do need it because you think that ancient grain harvesting was the same as capitalist materialism. 

>You proved my point for me. Even if capitalism isn't the right argument, you successfully rebutted yourself.

Why does everyone on this subreddit think they can just say, ""you are wrong because I said you're wrong, even though I didn't provide any logical arguments.""

You condescend to someone saying that this daughter is a bad person for making her mother suffer like this because you're assuming that the daughter's situation is neither her fault nor within her control to escape (due to mental illness, etc.) since you know someone for whom this is the case.

>Most pro-lifers would not be against abortion in the extreme case of an ectopic pregnancy, or for that matter in any situation in which the life of the mother were actually involved.

Dude, I have demonstrated that their policy positions are driven by this. 

>Pro-lifers want there to be no abortions, period

Bullshit. First off, if that were true, they wouldn't have so many abortions themselves.

Second, they rushed to the polls in 2000 and 2004 to vote for the candidate who would stop the steady decrease in abortions and would enact policies to keep the abortion rate artificially high. 

If they were really didn't want to have any abortions, they would think that fewer was better than more.

>I don't know what pro-lifers you are talking about who would prefer a woman to die from an abortion than not get pregnant in the first place. 

I didn't say ""die from an abortion"" I was talking about deaths from childbirth and ruptured ectopic pregnancies. Your Freudian slip reveals more than you realize about your side's position.

But do you really claim not to know about this? How can you expect to be taken seriously? The pro-life community's opposition to birth control even in places like Ghana, where 1 in 7 pregnancies ends with the mother's death is pretty well known. If you are really not aware of this position--you probably shouldn't be setting yourself up as the arbitrar of how the anti-choice community feels about women, and should accept that those of us who are actually educated on the subject know more about it than you do.

>I'm sorry if you've had a bad experience with a particularly nasty set of people, but that is not what the pro-life movement is about.

Wow. This is really insulting and condescending. This isn't about my personal experiences at all. It's about your side's policy positions, which are hostile, even deadly, to women. I'm sorry that your opinion of women is apparently too low to address this in any way other than insulting and trivializing me. (""Silly little woman, she had a bad experience with some nasty ole people, so she thinks the whole world is like this."" Never mind that that the silly little woman keeps referencing policy and public statements, not her personal experiences--just ignore any facts that get in the way of the stereotypes your crowd likes to spread about women).

>Which brings us back to my point that this is about life, which you have never responded to. 

Because you aren't being honest. I said I would respond to this when you were honest. 

All you have done is 1. pretend not to know that the pro-life crowd in general opposes birth control 2. pretend not to know that they vote for a party that calls for no exceptions to save the mother's life and 3. insult me and trivialize my concerns.

Even if we put aside your behavior in this thread, and accept your claim not to be driven by a desire to hurt women or exercise unreasonable control over them, the positions of the anti-choice community as a whole would show you to be the exception rather than the rule.

When you are honest about that, I will talk about the issue of when life begins, and when the mother's rights vs the child's rights becomes an issue. But not while you're still being dishonest either with me or with yourself. There would be no point in having such a discussion under those conditions.

>Yeah absolutely let's nerf a mastery just because of one guy. Absolute genius.

Never said that now did I. I said I wanted consistency across the champs. Many are able to proc it with one spell MF and Panth are two of them, which shouldn't be happening. You're sitting here complaining about it being one of the reasons he's strong right now and yet when I give a solution to said problem you shove sarcasm in my face. It's not like he's going to stop procing it all together, He just won't be able to E through a minion wave and proc it. 

>By all means then please count these dozen or so reasons, then remember that Riot also nerfs according to winrates. 

Riot can nerf however they please, doesn't necessarily mean it's the best route. Hell.. One of the biggest problems in the game right now is the Flash/Mobility, but instead of addressing it they nerf/change/rework everything else instead. easier course of action sure, but not the best. Seems like many people that build this new Ghostblade and new Blackcleaver have had a higher win-rate because of it, but it couldn't be that the items are too strong.. could it?

>Oh boy here we go.

Yes, Here we go. Given counters and you come up with more sarcasm and condescending tones. All of what I listed are counters to Panth. A counter doesn't need to directly counter someone from minute one though. Many champs still need to play it safe for the first few levels or until after a key piece of gear. Doesn't make them any less of a counter though. Panth still has a strong early-game kit so if people fail to play safely around it they're going to get fucked, plain and simple.. counter or not. It's almost as if you haven't laned against half the top laners. 

>You do realise that timeframe is literally a single second right? Panth can easily burst down any squishy unless they have defensive items in a single second without worry. The fact that you think Panth cannot quickly burst down squishies just shows that you don't know jackshit.

Panth does damage, but I think you're completely overestimating the damage he can do. If I'm fed, 10 kills ahead, 50CS ahead, yeah I'll fucking wreck squishes, but so will any other assassin that's that far ahead. I also never said he couldn't burst them down, he can, but he can't do it nearly as fast as someone like Zed can, nor as safely. Sorry if that was too hard for you to understand originally. 

>Oh yeah, every toplaner, midlaner and jungler in the game have a 3.6 Bonus AD scaling spammable AoE ability.

>And has 65 mana cost. In 0.75 seconds. Have fun trying to disable a Panth in 0.75, because unless you have an instant CC, you wont. Even if you do you'll already be dealt crazy high damage. Oh, and in lane he will always do this through a bunch of minions. So good luck getting through them too..

I like how you pick and choose what to respond to, yet forget what your original statement was. 

First you complain because the spell has low mana cost. Everything in League has a low fucking mana cost, get over it. Second, You're complaining about the damage he can do in 0.75 seconds. There's a dozen champs out there that can kill you in a second flat if you slip up. They're called Assassins. Get used to it. Third, You complain that CC is pretty much useless against him, well it's not. Knockbacks and stuns both stop his channel, and some can be reliably cast before half the channel is up others can be primed, ready to go when he tries to engage further minimizing the damage you take. Then you complain that he can poke you through minions.. Well.. So can many many other champs in League. 

Like I said originally. I don't get what your point is, if there is one it's poorly made. All I'm reading is complaints from a bad player that regularly gets stomped on by Panth. Even when the complaints that you have are common elsewhere in League too and not unique to just panth. 

>Are you sure you are talking about LoL right now?

I'm talking about LoL, you seem to be talking about Hello Kitty Island Adventure - Hand Holding expansion though. You know.. the one where Riot comes and saves all the Kittens from the big evil Pantheon

>Quite the opposite actually. I got 20 games with him at the end of last season and preseason, with only 5 of them being losses.

Not sure if bragging, or just trying to throw more win-rates in there for good measure. Also have to laugh at the 20 games part. Good sample size. 

>Okay this is the point where you pretty much admitted you have no idea what you are talking about.

>Minus 0.6 bonus AD ratio. On a spell with........ 3.6 bonus AD ratio. Literally 1/6 of it's damage. Also the base damage nerf is minimal. It's only 40 damage less at max rank. With the ratio and the base combined, that's literally less than a fraction of it's damage.

So I don't know what I'm talking about, but you do? 

1/6th nerf to anything would be quite a strong nerf. 17% damage reduction(rounded up of course). Hell, they even chopped off an extra 40 damage late-game too. It doesn't seem like much until you consider that Pantheon only has two AD scaling spells, the base damage on his shield is incredibly poor and his R is gimmicky at the best of times(rare to ever deal full damage to any one target, mostly used for purposes other than the damage). 

>In fact, I'm %100 sure that the ult nerf will hurt him more. His Q is already strong in lane. 

What Ult nerf? You mean the love tap it got? Yeah, big whoop canceling an ult will lose you 100 mana and give you a 30 second cooldown. That's just devastating right? In all my years of Pantheon I might.. MIGHT cancel an ult once per round. You only really use it if you're pretty sure you want to use it anyways. Not a big deal tbh. 


Yes, he's the only Champion with such a high AD ratio, but other champions have other spells that have higher base damage, or more reliable damage output. 

>Also, something you said previously, you are correct, they don't want him to be played toplane. Because Panth's harass has no counterplay currently. It's a skill that ""You click, something happens, there is nothing enemy can do about it."". It's the same reason why Riot reworked Shen and Ryze. 

Exactly why his Q needs to be changed to a skillshot. Even I find it stupid. Obviously it would need higher AD ratios if it was a skillshot, but if it was significantly harder to use it would balance out. Better than point and click. 

I'd like to also point out, since you like to keep coming back to it. Panth does indeed have a 3.6AD Ratio. Panth is also lacking in the ultimate, and W spell area's though. One deals very little damage and scales off AP, and the other is an ultimate, where more often than not you're not using it as a damage dealer since it is unreliable and gives enough fair warning that most people can make it out, or almost out of it taking significantly less damage. So yes, he has high ratios on his TWO spells because he needs to have high ratios on them in order to compete. How do you think Zilean would fare if they did something similar to his bombs? He's only got one AP scaling damage dealing spell.. what would a 17% damage nerf and base damage nerf do to him?

I'd be fine if they decided to add in an AD ratio on his W. He is bashing you with a shield. It only makes sense. 

>You forgot about a couple dozen quotations around the word math.

The """"""""""math"""""""""" shows a 8 damage increase on his E in the Jungle. Everywhere else, it's nerfed. Is this going to affect his clear speed? Not really no. Even though that seems to be where they want Panth to be. 

>Please, you obviously don't know what you are talking about. Read the patch notes again and educate yourself.

It is short, but there are times of chaos. You have 10% of the grip if you hold the leash halfway down. You can have the handle in one end and shorten it with the other, but not easy with 2 dogs.

Afterwards, several objects can be linked together and to external libraries. You don't have to run the compiler three times in order for it to fix up the internal references. Moreover, if I change code in one module, I can then just relink instead of recompiling all the code. To your point: all the different stages of compilation (lexing, parsing, rewriting, code generation, linking) are loosely coupled. Back to my actual point: nothing like this is possible with TeX. It would be great if I was writing a book of several chapters, and touching only one source file would not require reparsing all the other chapters' sources. TeX has workarounds for this like `\includeonly`. This is a sign of the poor design of TeX."
"> ""High crimes and misdemeanors"" does not include anything and everything that offends Congress. 

Yes it does.

>Andrew Johnson was impeached for violating the Tenure of Office Act by removing his Secretary of War, not for ""being obnoxious."" 

Read the tenth article of his impeachment before you get so condescending:

>Making three speeches with intent to show disrespect for the Congress among the citizens of the United States.

And read about impeachment of judges. 

Impeachment is a political process that can be used to remove anyone that offends congress. And it has been used that way. 

Nevermind that Trump admitted to obstruction of justice on national television. "
">Ha I am a nurse and have done a good amount of OB. If you think the doc and OB nurses are not praying right along with the parents when it all heads south, you are fooling yourself. There are skills that the OB team brings to the table but when you start having late decelerations or any other indications of fetal distress & worst case demise, faith and furthermore hope that faith brings keeps you there.

Great, as a nurse perhaps you can tell me what did god actually do then? Also, if I read that correct you seem to be implying that medical professionals without religion would give up on a child sooner. Is this your intent? If you didn't believe in god, if you believed that this life was the one and only life and that if that child died that was it, would you be more inclined to just let it pass? I would hope not.


>As a matter of fact, when it is the worst case scenario and everything has gone to pot in the worst ways imaginable, having that hope to hold fast makes more of a difference than anything else really. I've seen it for the families that must now overcome tragedy, for nurses and staff that are devastated by the loss, and for those that are knowingly in the very twilight of their own existence. That faith gives hope, and the hope gives a strength that I can only pity someone to be with out in these types of circumstances. Grace is the result, in tragedy, in joy, it is grace for which I am most thankful.

Well. There are a few things about this bit. First of all hope. Hope is the desire or expectation for an event to occur. You certainly don't need a supernatural belief to want a child to live instead of die so you must be talking bout an expectation that something will. That brings us back to my previous question what did god actually do? Do you know if intercessory prayer has been demonstrated to be more effective than random chance? We know people pray for things all the time and do not receive their request so how do you know that hope is justified?

If someone needs faith to desire a good outcome, to work towards a good outcome or make the best of a unpleasant situation i don't see that as a strength. I see it as a weakness and that faith as a crutch supporting it. So please I neither need nor desire your pitty and frankly its pretty condescending.

"You appear to be labouring under the misconception that your way of using reddit is the single correct way to do so, and any restrictions it places on other ways are immaterial. Allow me to convince you otherwise, because you are open to hearing new concepts:

I subscribe to 72 subreddits. You may subscribe to less, but this is where I'm coming from. I will never have time to visit the home page for each of those subreddits to get the content that has been posted by using filters. Your response to my statement that it is onerous to customise each subreddit and visit each in turn makes it fairly clear that you're not considering this case. During the week, I seldom have time to check more than two subreddit main pages, though I follow the material on the front page on mobile a couple times a day. On the weekend I may have more time, and PC access, but I also have other demands on my time then.

> Well, there you go. It's not that your content isn't there. You just want it on the front page. The front page is meaningless. Everyone wants their content there. But it's not important. You use the filters and you get the content you want. That's why they exist in every subreddit.

This statement is... well, it's pretty dismissive. And I really don't think you have made any kind of substantive argument for why ""the front page is meaningless"". Let me make a counter-statement: if people use a specific view to consume reddit content, then it is not meaningless. Because reddit is a content sharing and discussion forum - that's really it. And this is part of its core purpose - to share content. So ignoring the front page because it makes your position of ""filters fix the content imbalance"" untenable is fairly disingenuous. It is the only practical means I have of accessing a collection of content from the mix of subreddits in which I am interested, which makes it pretty darn important to me.

> Yes. Lets do that. Enlighten me. I would love to be convinced that people who are already engaging in the use of the internet to find ""in-depth"" conversation can't be bothered to use the very obvious filters on the side bar.

Now you're just being condescending. That's really not helpful at all, but I hope that it at least made you feel better.

> Agreed! But the solutions are there. They're not hidden. Everything you need to get the content you want is right....there. It's plain as day. By all means, shoot me any great arguments for how moderation can aid it. So far all I've seen is people wanting to be on the front page. That's it...Nobody needs the front page to get their content. If you have a compelling reason or even a solution to make everyone happy, I'm all fuckin' ears, my friend. I'll preach the solution from now on. But again, everyone is just bitching about wanting front page, which is not important at all to getting the content you want.

Solutions are great, but we need to state the problems first. Creating solutions before we actually understand the problems and their root causes is a fantastic way to miss the point and make everyone's life a little worse, and everyone more cynical about whether the problems can really be solved. That is the entire point of this discussion! It's clear that people aren't agreed on what the problem is, or even if there is a problem, so we really need to hash that out before proposing any kind of action, because we can't target the action to a problem that is poorly defined!"

">This is a conversation after all, please feel free to express how you feel.

That's a comma splice. I normally wouldn't point that sort of thing out, but since you care about punctuation, you might want to learn about that.

As for your original comment: you pointed out the EU comparison. I indicated in my first reply that, yes, there IS a similarity (you can look at my first response to you; it's all right there). However, I also let you know that a lot of people directly equated the USA with the EU. In fact, that is what prompted me to edit my original comment in the first place so as to indicate that there are some pretty substantial divergences between the USA and the EU.

Thus, I was not saying your comment was wrong, as you seem to think. I was saying that you are entering into a debate that you didn't understand and didn't bother to research, and thus your comments were at best trivial. If you don't believe me, put in the time to reading a bunch of other responses, and you'll see how many people say that the situation in the US is the same as the EU. As I have said all along, this is true. But similar and same are two different concepts.

Thus, my irritation with your responses is--for the last time--not that they are wrong. It's that they are redundant, obvious, and display an ignorance of the purpose for which I qualified my original post. In other words, don't be so eager to teach until you're sure you understand. It comes off as condescending and ill informed, and it prompts people to give you dismissive replies and downvotes."

A parent earning something doesn't mean the child did too. When they get that inheritance it is no different from unearned income.

I dare you to find me a study proving it. If:

>it's a finding that has been established over and over, across many studies, in both specific and general populations, using a variety of techniques and methods.

that 'people with problems who get therapy do better', it should take no time at all to find these studies you bullshit of.

Or you can be like every other reddit shit talker and say 'there have been studies' and then not link to them because there arent any.

Either way, you should know your grasp on both English and the concept of peer reviewed science seem to be entry level at best, because anyone who has taken a 101 level class in either psychology or any sort of science knows what a ridiculous and impossible to defend/prove statement you made. 

You didnt even define 'problems' in the slightest sense. If Im having problems cooking my steak to medium or seasoning it perfectly, how in fuck is a therapist going to help?

Next time you want to be condescending maybe try learning a bit about what youre talking about first. You should start with the scientific method because clearly youre not familiar.

">Should they be paid more as now they're working harder to counter balance higher volume? Yes. But that's not really what I'm saying here. Kiosk stores don't destroy jobs. Period. 

No, not period. Because there might be more people eating at McDonald's, but where are they coming from? Research suggests people are eating less fast food, not more. That means McDonald's is servicing more people with less jobs and since demand is also going down that means other places are losing people if it's not McDonald's, which I would say has been more my choice to go on the odd occasion I do eat fast food because the service has become better.

Here's a tip when you're discussing something with someone: just because you don't understand someone doesn't mean they're wrong. Don't be condescending and end your replies with ""Period."" as if you're so fucking smart no one else could think of something you can't.

>""The law"" is kind of an abstraction

That is precisely my point: it has no power beyond people's willingness to uphold it. It is upheld by the people of a state. It is not upheld by children's service agencies, but by the people who work at and believe in children's service agencies.

>""our civilization is based on the right of each individual to secure his right to life, and it is this mutual recognition which is the reason why we cooperate on things like rule of law.

Actually, what that sounds like is Thomas Hobbes, and really the more relevant thinker along the lines of the higher order rights of humans which exist in a social context would be Rousseau. But you meant to imply that reflections of political philosophy in popular culture imply their falsehood? How does that work? 

I am glad you helped a little old lady. That is awesome; I like to help people when I can too. But do you know why we can do that? It is because we typically don't need to worry about getting killed for our food or possessions because we have established a society which protects those interests for us. 

We come from scared little mammals which showed up after the dinosaurs. Civilization is a coping mechanism: it allows us to thrive in an otherwise largely hostile environment, or at least in an environment which doesn't really care whether we live or die. But what civ does is allows us to care about others, and to provide for the common good.

Now, this is a great idea, and certainly a great reason why humans have done so well as far as thriving is concerned. But it does not and cannot supplant protection against the immediate dangers which still exist in the world, and this is why the idea that one can or should allow some outside entity (CPS, was your example) to be the main protection of their interest in staying alive is a bad one.

I am neither angry, nor jaded. I am looking at reality and pulling from it. If you really think that the law is always going to be there, or that you can place your trust in it wholeheartedly, I am saying that you are deluded and have been lulled into this state by the unprecedented stability which you have experienced in your lifetime. Yes, it is awesome that I don't need to fight and scrape to feed myself and my family, but I am not going to pretend like this is anything but flatly unbelievable, extremely fragile, and that I am incredibly lucky to be alive to experience it.

">Jill Stein holds absolutely no chance of winning this election

Nobody with any kind of sense of reality thinks she will win, but there are still many reasons to vote for her including getting her into the debates, or the green party in general, and getting her/the green party public funding so that we can have an alternative to the two biggest shit shows in America right now.

>or whether they just like to think of themselves as progressive. 

This seems like a really easy way to just dismiss people you don't agree with, like the purity tests the Hillbots have been complaining about from us Sanders folk. Progressive goals/values aren't tied to one party at this point, and the democratic party have shown that they don't necessarily value progressive values, just progressive voters, and I say this as someone who not only supported and donated to Sanders but also as someone who has been a Dem since '98. 

>A vote for Stein is half a vote for Trump if you believe in progressive values. 

This is a shitty way that the two parties always use to push people to vote for one or the other of the two parties, it's a scare tactic, is it true, yeah if that voter's alternative was Clinton, but if they're Bernie or bust they're voting for someone other than Clinton no matter what and they can still hold to their progressive values by voting for Stein, they don't owe their vote or allegiance to anyone who they don't feel deserves it, and it's patronizing to push otherwise. 

>Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton because he understands all of this. You cannot simply wish us into a different political system, and you certainly cannot change our political duopoly by voting for someone who is not a serious candidate.

Just because Sanders threw in the towel for the compromise he negotiated shouldn't mean anyone else has to, Sanders always said ""not me, us"" it was never about him it was always about us, I wish him the best of luck and anyone else who supported him should as well. However that shouldn't mean we have to be fucking lemmings and vote for who he tells us to, especially when that person has a mountain of evidence pointing to the fact that Hillary and the DNC fucked us over. Overall it's up to us, not up to some guy on the internet saying because we're not voting for Hillary we're not ""progressive enough"" what a load of shit.

Also saying someone is not a serious candidate is pretty damned condescending as well, she put her money up, she's getting her message out there, just because she doesn't have however much money the DNC and wealthy ass donors backing her doesn't mean she's not serious, she's ran for the last few elections regardless of knowing that she will most likely lose, if that's not serious I don't know what is.

">Again, he was our terrorist, is that more clear to you?

It was never unclear to me, and if you don't see the irony in Israel's canonization of a terrorist, then we have a fundamentally different view of irony that no back-and-forth is going to address or resolve.

>Okay, history lesson. Lehi members joined the Herut party which was part of Jabowtinsky's idealogical movement like them. As such they were, for the first 30 years of Israel's existence, part of the opposition. They were not incorporated into the government, they were voted in during the late seventies. Before that they were ostracised from government positions by the left wing coalition. Is that clear?

You don't need to give me a history lesson (I have a BA in this subject), and you don't need to be condescending - especially when I've been nothing but polite. It's unnecessary and it's rude. I'm perfectly familiar with the history of the Lehi and of Revisionism in general. Your summary underlines the basic point I was trying to make - that members of the Stern Gang were incorporated into the GOI at its highest level, and that saying they were ""forcibly disarmed"" is at best a partial truth. 

As for Bernadotte, I really don't see the point in this back-and-forth. As was demonstrated by the fact that he was shot to death by a gang of terrorists for doing his job, being a diplomat during this period was not exactly as risk-free as you seem to be suggesting it was. I suspect that if he hadn't been a negotiator over the fate of the end of the Mandate, you wouldn't be attempting to minimize his role. Maybe he'd even be one of the חסידי אומות העולם. Frankly, I'm kind of sad that this conversation has even turned to this level - it's a distraction from the original point, which was that even if Bernadotte didn't accomplish much, he was still a noncombatant who was murdered for political goals, which is the main point. By participating in this argument with you, I'm validating the idea that somehow the worth of his life, or the acceptable nature of his murder, is dependent on how many Jewish lives he saved or how much danger he put himself in. I hope you agree that that's a pretty sad idea, but whether or not you do, I'm not going to continue lending credence to it by discussing the details of Bernadotte's career in connection with his death. 

Perhaps I wasn't clear enough. The comparison I was trying to make was not between Amir and Shamir, but rather between the assassination of Bernadotte and the assassination of Rabin. Both men were killed by ideological fanatics who thought that it was acceptable to murder noncombatants in order to further the goal of retaining more territory under Israeli control. My initial point here was that there was a certain irony in Israel - a nation that has been a victim of terrorism and makes a point of fighting terrorism very aggressively - mourning a PM who was, himself, a terrorist. You acknowledge that Shamir was a terrorist, and if you don't see the irony in it, then I don't think we have much more to discuss. "
">I think we make a mistake, though, and as a society and certainly as, as individuals, when we take what is today accepted as right and wrong and go back 100, 200, 300 years or more and say what those, you know, what Christopher Columbus did was wrong

That's a cute notion until it's used to completely miss the moral lessons of history. It's nice to say we can't judge the past because it lets you have heroes from the past, but it makes us far more susceptible to present-day wrongdoing. We can contextualize the past while recognizing that the things these people did are wrong, and in fact failure to do that may make it more difficult to stamp out harmful ideologies carried over from that past.

Perhaps there's always a certain fear in that sentiment about our own actions being judged in the future, but I honestly find that comforting. I want future generations to look back in disgust, I want them to strive to do better than we have.

So, yeah. Christopher Columbus was a greedy, genocidal monster and we shouldn't be venerating him. Robert E Lee felt very conflicted about fighting a bloody war to enslave people, and there are lessons to be had there about how there is no honor in supporting atrocity out of duty, but he wasn't a hero and we shouldn't be venerating him.

"> Only people have beaten all these games without any gear or stats whatsoever...

Indeed, people have. Likely people who made it through at least once with gear and stats, to learn what they were doing. You don't 'git gud' through repeated failure, you git gud by practicing, and this is the sort of thing that makes it difficult to practice.

> Also there exists A) Consumables which reset this and B) a covenant which make them always respawn.

Which are a) consumable, and b) must be found. I figure if I could make those things happen reliably, I'd be good enough I wouldn't be so worried about running out of enemies.

> If you don't enjoy the game why are you playing it?

I'm not. I think I gave it a fair attempt, and I think I might have a better chance at actually getting somewhere now that I know some things about it. But I gave up at the first real boss. Thought I made that clear.

> I'm sorry but why does the game have to spoonfeed you all the information and the mechanics?

As opposed to... what, exactly? I'm not suggesting spoonfeeding, exactly -- I'm suggesting not being quite so deliberately obtuse.

Do you really, honestly think that putting a couple of numbers on the screen, with no explanation whatsoever, and relying on players noticing that those numbers go up when they consume a ""Humanity"" item and go down when they ""Restore Humanity""... do you think that is a good thing? I'm really curious how you figured that one out, if you did.

It really doesn't seem to me that this sort of reverse engineering is what makes Dark Souls good. But, I mean, good for you if you do:

> The first time I played Dark Souls I fatrolled, thought it felt wrong and opened my stats menu to look for some hint of why. There I found a stat named ""equip load"".

> So I messed around with my equipment (because equip load probably have something to do with equipment right?), found out that having less bulky gear on makes me roll faster and went on with the game.

Yep. Good guess. I assumed I'd have to actually sell off some equipment, or store it in a box at a bonfire, because that's what would physically make sense, and because many other games do it that way.

But the way you describe it, even here, does this really add much? Surely there's a way to make it slightly clearer without stooping to Skyrim's ""You are over-encumbered"" flashing on the screen, right?

> ...maybe you should keep to, I don't know, God of War maybe, where you get a flashing button prompt when you have to do something.

And this is the condescending bullshit OP was complaining about. It's hard to talk about game difficulty, when the response is essentially to be talked down to and told ""You suck, it's not the game's fault."" It's possible the game's not for me, but I still think my experience highlights some actual problems -- I think there are ways to make the game more accessible without making it easier. And it really doesn't seem like the majority of Soulsborne players are actually happy about these games being inaccessible."

"> There is a lot more to sex than shoving in a large duck. 

Yes there is, but that's not the point. This is /r/smalldickproblems, not /r/ImAnAllAroundBadLover. This subreddit is for problems specifically related to small dicks, as in piv sex. Penis in vagina. When you start talking about other things like being an all around better lover (which is definitely important), it's a cop out and it's rather condescending. We're talking specifically about piv sex here in this subreddit. We know we can be masters of oral, exploration, and communication, but that's not the fucking point. So all the 'advice' you women give in all of your threads is kind of irrelevant because we're talking specifically about penis in vagina sex. 

For most women, piv with a small penis is almost always lackluster compared to what it could be with a man size penis. As I said before, it's not even a quesiton. It's just the truth and we all know it. If you prefer small dicks, you are an exception and part of the minority. We're not saying that larger is better, we're saying that smaller is worse

> There are women who will want a large size

But more specifically, most women don't want a small size. Most women want at least average, that is, man size, not child size

> The point is that the size of your penis does not limit you sexually

It does, seeing as most women don't prefer small dicks because they're simply not as good. There's much less of a choice of women for small guys so small guys just have to take whatever they can get. Also, I think it's a little different for you now that you're older. Young women have a different mentality than older women "

If you're going to make reference to a group that supposedly has superior qualifications to make a more informed judgment, you cannot have that group anonymous. You continually do this. 

The ""4 out of 5 dentists"" argument is fallicious, plus it's ""4 out of 5 surveyed"" which without the details of how the survey was taken, is meaningless, just like your ""majority of scholars"" claim.

In another dialogue with you, I cited Dr. Robert M. Price as a reference of a qualified scholar who questions the historicity of Jesus. The guy holds 2 PhDs including one on the New Testament and has written dozens of books and is widely respected by both theists and non-theists. Your response was to summarily dismiss him as some kind of ""fringe"" without any further explanation. Your claims are without foundation. You engage in hit-and-run ad hominem attacks and then post condescending monologues about how you're so better-informed than everybody else it's not worth your time to debate. With all due respect, fuck you.

If you had dropped ranked flex, that underlying purpose (that you had contradicted a true statement with a false one) would not have existed. Sure, you may have been missing 3v3 normals, but the true driving force behind the comment would not have existed.

I only got ""spun up"" when you mocked me (as you described it), and then started with that condescending ""champ"" and ""buddy"" garbage, and when you implied that I fabricated that hawking quote. Those things are very confrontational. Don't behave that way, and then pretend to be surprised and amused that you've ""spun me up"".

You could have simply asked for the context to the hawking quote- that would have been polite. You chose not to be.

You could have avoided the condescending language, but you chose not to.

You could have chosen to have a conversation that didn't start right into mockery, but you didn't.

The government still owns everything, they just do so through the mob of nomenklatura who the public utilities were sold off to for bargain basement prices in return for an oath of fealty to the corrupt Russian government. That has naught all to do with capitalism. 

You're right, I was rather snidely mocking your own way of arguing. Sorry, but your condescending tone is bringing out that side of me. 

So, you're willing to say that it's the oligarchical dictatorship that's to blame for their problems now, not capitalism... but you won't say the same about when they were under supposed socialism/communism, huh? Or do you think they're still ""secretly socialist""? Go to r/conspiracy if that's the case

You're making excuses because it's inconvenient that even slightly socialist governments have had successes. 

>They most certainly did not. Rampant poverty dominates the USSR to this day, and China has only come out of their poverty tailspin since the introduction of some actual capitalist economics. 

Once again, I was just illustrating that your life expectancy argument isn't a particularly good one. You seem to be disregarding it too, now that I've used it against you. Rampant poverty dominating Russia? but... they're capitalists now! What happened? Why didn't McDonalds solve their hundreds of years old problems?

Once again, China has implemented capitalism in a very limited way. They've done a smart job of it, actually, by keeping it's dirty, greedy hands away from a large portion of their industry.

>The poorest places on earth are those that have not been touched by capitalism, not those which have. 

What? Are you talking about... undiscovered tribes in jungles or what? Yeah, I guess you could say the Native Americans or aborigines were poor until they found capitalism... I guess. Of course they were then raped, murdered and had their land stolen... but they did get the concept of money and private property, so I guess there were ""richer"" that sense.

Everywhere with any degree of civilization has been affected by capitalism, and the poorer places are exploited to maximum effect if they have anything of value for capitalist pirates to plunder.

Are you serious? Almost all products have some form of planned obsolescence in place. You, in fact, have acknowledged that to some degree already. This is horrifyingly wasteful, and it doesn't ""drive"" progress, but retards it. You do not source your claim about cars, but even if it's true (I should say that I really doubt it is) one exception does not nullify the waste and damage done by planned obsolescence.

It's not ""willful ignorance"" to not interpret the Bible literally. Feel free to take everything said in the Bible literally, and to feel that contradictions disprove it, go ahead. Don't think of that as anything more than an opinion though, and that anyone who disagrees with you is an irrational fool.

> Science does not need to disprove religion any more than it has to disprove that there are invisible flying monkeys all around us

When people compare religion to magic, I get the impression that they don't really understand religion at all in the first place and it drives me from expecting any productive conversation. I've learned recently that I do very much enjoy discussing religion, but only so long as the other party is not condescending. ""Magic"" is an immature worldview that closes off your mind, with no attempts to understand or appreciate the world. Again, trying to gain understanding the world is not mutually exclusive with religion. It's not the 16th century, no ones closing their ears to scientific findings. Perhaps where you live many people do take the story of creation literally, but in my area, little (especially the old testament) is seen that way.

From my perspective, I see evidence of God in the world itself. In nature and in parental relationships. I was basically and atheist/agnostic for a solid 2 years. After all, I had grown up in a Catholic school, which is essentially a bubble, and wasn't used to even the basic challenges of faith (I do wish the church brought them up more, it makes for interesting discussion within the church...the problem being that if you disagree you might as well start a new church as you are not a ""true"" Catholic then). But as of recently I have been leaning more back towards faith. If I do come back to faith, I know I'd have a much stronger foundation to it. If God were to provide the kind of evidence you are asking for, then it would make the concept faith meaningless in my opinion. So feel free to ignore it, I won't blame you. That's simply a different world view. You could show a religious person all the science involved in nature, parental relationships, ect, and it wouldn't change anything, as the two are not mutually exclusive.

Which isn't to say that first-year economics texts are infallible, but you don't seem to be making any kind of an argument as to why they would be wrong in this case.

Excuse me but having faction independent play and flying mounts, the ability to receive emails are far from cosmetic. I don't know how much experience you have with MMO's but having a flying mount is a vastly different experience than not having one.

Also those were merely a couple of examples, I could have written more but I had already written a novel so I thought I'd cut it short.

Thirdly, they weren't complaints. I was merely making a couple of observations as I already said.

>You didn't have any problem with story or quest integration.

None that I mentioned, besides all the ones I did mention.

Again, those were only two examples (and they do effect gamplay), I could think of tons of ways that they could have been more innovative on this game. They chose the safe route, and that's one way to go. But the game that figures out how to change things up and does it really well will be the one that ends up being the next WoW. Star Wars was one of the few licences that could have done this and they missed the boat.

>There are no flying cars on Hoth, please don't pretend to talk down to me Wolf. The only things that can survive the intense cold on Hoth would be space grade ships or speeders, not casual flying cars like on Coruscant.

Ok, show me where I said that the only type of flying vehicle I would want is a casual flying car like on Coruscant. Obviously, you would want to have different vehicles for different occasions. I would have no problem having to buy a cold weather flying vehicle to fly on Hoth.

>My post was nothing against you and I wish you hadn't felt the need to insult my intellect.

Excuse me if that does not make me go out of my way to be polite to you. If you wish for civil discourse, fine. Don't act like a dick and you wont get treated like one.

>You going into an MMO with no prior knowledge of what that game is going to have or realistic expectations shows that you are clearly not the targeted crowd. Anyone that doesn't research a product that would potentially require hundreds of hours of gameplay doesn't really get to criticize said product.

What a load of horseshit. I challenge you to find any quote from the developer that even comes close to backing that up. That is just fanboy speculation.

>Also you said you want to role play a character, not play black and white roles? I'm sorry MMOs might not be for you.

I addressed this in my op. That kind of thinking is stupid. Simply because no other game gives you this freedom, does not mean that people don't want it. Again, you aren't the only gamer out there, and I know a lot of gamers feel like I do.

>And in an established universe like Star Wars you don't get to have the option to do whatever you want as there are already established rules in the universe. Next you are going to tell me you want to be a Rancor Jedi Knight because, damnit you should be able to do what you want.

Nice straw man you got there. Sure, I was arguing for something as stupid as a Rancor Jedi. All of my suggestions make sense in the lore, as well as gameplay wise.

"> Also not true. Sané was over 2 years older than Sancho now when he made his league debut for Schalke.

Sane made his Bundesliga debut on March 21, 2014. He was born on January 11, 1996. That is being at the age of 18. Same age Jadon will be next season. That was my point. 

Our coach has come out and said young players will be involved in the USA tour but they are not ready for more due to no B-teams. That doesn't instill me with much confidence that he plans to use any of them. Considering Navas is being given a contract over Maffeo, and considering Kelechi wasn't given time like Rashford was to have some bad games after stellar first seasons, really puts doubts over youth integration at City. Especially with Pep spending the GDP of Zimbabwe again. 

The choice Jadon has to make is whether to move to a club where there is a clear path to first team and or stay at City, probably be the best paid teenager in the world and try to impress on loans. 

I mean we can make excuses and rationalize every decision, but the objective view is we haven't brought an academy player through for ages. We keep spending huge every summer. We binned off our star prospect from last year without giving him chances like Rashford was given. Youth integration is not a key aspect at City.

">Locally-grown, seasonally appropriate are just buzz words. There are millions of tons of corn grown ""locally"" in Iowa, so what?

I'm speaking in simplified terms. I am referring to growing crops that are bred in particular regions for robustness in their climate. The corn grown in the midwest is not a 'local' crop, but one bred for specific commercial applications, not regionally-appropriate genes.

Food crops are currently selected for their ability to be shipped over long distances, for example. But often these breeds are weaker than ones developed for a region over generations, meaning they need more chemical inputs. THAT is what I mean by regionally appropriate food. You either know nothing of the subject, or are just being a dick.

Also, you;'re simply wrong:  http

You're being condescending and intentionally re framing the debate. The economic argument for buying food from a local farmer is to support local farmers, which allows them to continue growing food, even as land prices around them skyrocket and subsidies prop up their huge competitors.

"It's depressing that our team relies so heavily on a player that has massively declined, and no matter what won't be benched because he's captain. 

> Don't talk about the players if you don't remember that time.

Wtf are you on about. Don't even start acting condescending because you don't grasp my point. My memory stretches back further than 5 years. Giggs and Neville don't play for us now, why would I be depressed right now about the fact that they declined if it doesn't currently impact the team? It was sad at the time to see Neville decline as well because it negatively affected the team, but I'm hardly sad about it now am I?

Regardless, when Giggs and Neville started to decline, they were benched and weren't played every minute of every game. Neville was phased out while Rafa was being phased in, Giggs was used more sparingly. Giggs also never declined anywhere near as hard as Rooney (Or at least it seems that way because we weren't as reliant on Giggs because of how good the rest of the team was). He was still able to have a big impact on games up until he retired. United had plenty of options and Fergie wasn't afraid to bench either of them. 

Watching old Rooney videos is a depressing reminder that he has declined, but despite that he will never be benched, regardless of how he performs, which hurts the team. It's not the same situation at all."
"> Are you seriosuly saying that wearing mens clothes makes her a little bit trans?

No, not at all. She's not transgender at all as far as I know. She just has a more masculine gender expression. This is exactly why how you feel and how you dress/present yourself can be separated, and should be in some cases. You're the one suggesting that she's a little bit trans, not me.

> How do you decide whether it's the sex or the gender that is wrong? Science or feelings?

First of all, you're using the term ""feelings"" to belittle very real psychological issues. Don't do that, it's condescending and ignorant.

But to be more clear, gender dysmorphia is better described as your sex and your gender disagreeing with each other. And since it's easier to change your outside to make your inside feel better, then we say the sex is ""wrong"". Really there's not a right or a wrong. And that's where the other genders on the spectrum fall in. Someone who is born male, feels female, but expresses male, might not feel like they shouldn't have a penis. This is where you get terms like bigender, genderqueer, intergender, etc.

Think of it like a video game with a character customization screen like Skyrim. Among all the usual sliders for things like hair color, eye distance, etc, there are sliders for each of the following attributes:

 Sex

 Gender

 Gender expression

 Sexuality

None of those sliders determines the position of any of the other ones, and you don't get to decide where any of them fall when you're born. And in the game, the programming is set up that when you, as a born female who feels male, go to a merchant and buy an outfit, let's say the one that's called ""blacksmith's gear"", it automatically makes it a dress. But you don't want to wear a dress, you want to wear pants. That would suck for you. And you can't just change your gender, that was determined for you before the game even started. So what do we have to do? Change the programming."

Me not sharing your opinions about how great the lore is (which is also an opinion, not a fact) does not make them magically false. However, the notion that JRPG fans don't know how to play a WRPG is genuinely false, and it's incredibly condescending of you to believe that people who don't like something you don't like ""don't get it,"" when believe it or not some people just don't like those types of games. It's not a matter of ""understanding"" or whatever the hell you seem to think it is, it's a matter of taste.

"> This is an attempt to discredit Wade because he waited a long time to report it. This is a common thing to do. The reality is, people who haven't been abused or groomed have a real trouble to understand the behavior of victims. It's common for people in Wade's alleged situation to perceive their abuse, not as abuse, but as normal. These children weren't forced into sexual situations but were coerced and they willingly performed sexual acts. In that way, there is the element of abuse victims not seeing themselves as victims. Often, a big life moment that occurs in the victim makes them re-evaluate their past, in this case it was Wade's baby boy that was born. He had a nervous breakdown as a result.

The fact remains, he waited too long. He asked for money and went for that instead of justice. There is no justice in suing a dead man. There's no way of ever knowing and going after someone who cannot defend themselves, well...there's always a chance it could've happened but we'll never know and YOU need to stop acting like you do know. 

It pisses me off how all three accusers primary objective was money. Not jail time, no, they wanted cash. I get that damages are probably best amended by money but it's not like Robson would be broke, he has had a very successful career.

> Again, I can't stress this enough. We shouldn't believe Wade 100% yet, but don't dismiss him because his behaviour doesn't match with what you consider to be a reasonable person - if he has been abused then his behaviour is prone to be different.

I'm basing it on the fact that MJ has always had a huge target on his back because of the money he earned and his gentle nature (as well as his naievity from lack of normality in his life). That would've been like lions to a gazelle. 

> Okay, point taken, but Wade slept in MJ's bed - Beyonce isn't sleeping with her potential stars. Also, Jordi Chandler and Jimmy Safechuck were not performers - amongst others.

Other people who slept in his bed testified in his defence at the 2005 trial. I know it was wrong of MJ to do that, I'm not denying that. I'm just saying, it's not outlandish for a celebrity to be associated with child entertainers and/or sick kids. That's standard.

> Again, this is a common issue. Your only source of information, or your main source, is the potential culprit himself...MJ!

In the interview I linked, he mentions Barry Gibb and says Gibb wouldn't mind and he wouldn't care if his kids slept in the same room/bed as Gibb because they're close friends. Don't you think if Gibb had been against that he would've said something? Again, Macaulay Culkin testified in MJ's defence, and he slept in the bed. Also...his ex-wives? Don't you think THEY would've said something? Lisa Marie said she would've killed him if she had any inkling or knowledge of anything sinister occurring. Both his ex-wives defended him and continue to.

> Consider his excuses for his plastic surgeries, him claiming he didn't bleach his skin, him claiming he's not anti-Semitic yet he did hold those beliefs (there's a reason he wrote ""jew me)"". 

What he does with his skin is nobody's business to begin with. He had vitiligo, which runs in my family, it does make your skin go completely, stark white. He had it in patches all over his body so if he needed to use creams or whatever to even it out, so be it. That's his choice. The problem with the bleaching theory is it was used to discredit him as an African American. The media went on for years about how he hated being black and was ashamed to be a person of colour. There was this awful underlying impression that he was a jealous black man wanting to live the rich white life of luxury. It was used to make him look lesser than white people and to turn black people against him. When I was 5, I asked my grandad if he liked MJ, first thing he said was ""No, he's black trying to be white"". The media bullshit worked so I completely understand if MJ felt the need to deny that when it was used against his racial identity. 

> Why don't you look at the evidence in the 2004 trial? Why don't you hear the accounts of the various people who worked in neverland? You would do yourself a great service if you did. Honestly, read some of their accounts - not just MJs. Read what happened in the Chandler case. He was sleeping in his bed all the time!

Why don't you quit with the condescending tone? This isn't my first day on the internet. I have read everything. Why do you automatically believe Chandler btw? Have you read about Chandler getting caught spying on MJ while he got changed? Being unable to correctly identify a birthmark on MJ's privates? The fact that his dad (the accuser) killed himself a couple weeks after MJ died? The fact that Chandler got a restraining order against his dad?

> My multitude of evidence doesn't pertain to Wade. Since the mid 80s MJ has had a string of boyfriends, always boys aged 8-13 who he was very very close with. I mean that's a fact you can't deny, he was always close with boys of that age, never girls. Ask yourself how a family who aren't that wealthy could get $20million from a man who can afford the best legal team on the planet (Jordi Chandler). You don't pay out that much and choose not to clear your name for no reason.

Michael was an overworked, abused boy. Not only by his father, his brothers too. When he was a child, he had to sleep in the same room as his brothers while they had sex with groupies. He talked about warning girls away from them knowing they were just going to one night stand them. He talked about his dad beating them up if they got their dance moves wrong, scaring them with masks and about finding his sister unconscious from a possible beating in the bathroom one day. He talked about his father making fun of his nose, saying ""That's not a Jackson nose"" which is what caused MJ to get such drastic surgery on it. Joe Jackson has fully admitted to all of the physical abuse, saying it was to ensure they'd be successful. Michael spoke at length his entire life about not having a childhood and wanting to recapture it. He had the money and power to do so, so he set about recreating a young life for himself. It's not normal, not saying it is. But it's what he felt he needed to do for himself to feel more normal. The boy friends were part of that. They were the kid friends he never had when he was a kid, because he was too busy performing for us. 

> You don't pay out that much and choose not to clear your name for no reason.

He actually wanted to fight the first one. He was going to until his lawyers basically closed the door on that. It's why he insisted on fighting the next one, letting it play out in court in front of everyone. 

> I mean, do some research outside of these MJ fansites - they're incredibly biased. Remember, no one knew MJ, you think you did, but you didn't. You knew a part of him, the part he chose to display. Don't discount that he could exhibit these criminal behaviours just because he's a great singer and a great dancer. He didn't give the world all of his personality.

Same to you. Don't demonize someone just because there's a whole lot of people wanting to paint that picture. You know as much as I do, not more.

You haven't provided any credible sources. Your opinion goes in direct opposition to a US court AND the FBI. You discredit pro-MJ sources because they tell you what you don't want to hear.

>The dictionary exist to sort words out, not to give authoritive guidance on their subtleties.

I just wanted to mention this part because I found it amusing to proclaim an overall purpose of the dictionary and to claim that it isn't ""authoritive"" when that isn't even a word. And yes, the dictionary is certainly an authoritative source of sorts. I don't know how you can claim that without even providing a justification.

>In the case of racism, we all understand, that the term ""racism"" was popularized as a description of nazi politics, and the way it ideologically motivated by a belief in racial hierarchies.

Racism as a concept predates the Nazi party by many centuries and the word itself traces back to the 19th century.


>Even if today, you can find dictionaries that for brevity's sake define racism just as ""negative beliefs about a race"", or somethig like that, it is undeniable that the term is dripping with a heavy accusation, that the one called ""racist"" is about to bring back the Bad Old Days.

>Having two superstars means a lot less when around half the league has at least one. At this point, we have to look at everything else.

I disagree with this. Top 30 players of all-time are better than the average superstar. You're basically saying, this team has two superstars (but they're actually better than the average superstar), but everyone has at least one, so those don't count. I don't follow.

If we use Bill Simmons' all-time rankings for the sake of argument, there are 4 of top 40 players of all-time still playing in the Western conference--Duncan Kobe Nash Dirk. Two of them would be on the same team. TWO! I think you're letting the outcome of the current season influence your rankings too much. Everyone is in their prime now. Did you know Boozer's prime is statistically almost a wash with LMA and Blake Griffin? Jeremy Lin's Linsanity numbers were 27 and 8. That supporting cast is not as weak as it may seem."

The majority makes the decision. If the majority doesn't partake, it's because they might be ambivalent? What they actually are is discussing this in the background, debating this everywhere. The narrative is shaping - and the overwhelming one is that the protesters are idiots, violent and unreasonable. They are protesting something that is impossible, zero fees. This narrative is being driven by the universities and the media. You've fallen prey to not thinking for yourself. You laugh at my viewpoint that the chaos is where change happens, so you're a traditionalist? You, as the majority, is not capable of discussing the nuance that is that the feesmustfall is part of a larger anger towards the state - but hey, I don't use my brain - honestly.

> How pathetic is it that they have not fully stopped the violent protest? surely the silent majority are the majority right?

Donald Trump uses that same language. Pathetic! Sad! They haven't stopped the protest because the protest is gaining traction. Non-violent protests don't work in this country. Why are you so angry?

> So this is undemocratic and mob justice rules, and you defend it.

I defend change and democracy. I don't defend them. I don't defend violence. What I do defend is an overwhelming and massive voice against people who are literally protesting and creating a paradigm shift around the idea that the state is all-powerful. They are chipping away at a state in dissaray and doing more for change in this country away from the ANC than anyone else doing it quietly. They are creating a consciousness that includes fighting for what you believe in.

> Yes a blame silent majorities. We held the nazis accountable yet they only had 25% support... think about it please.

Majorities (and in the context I used it) are silent until they are driven to stand up. My rebuttal was for Keegan's discussion that the majority of protesters support the minority that are violent, I was making the point that the majority are silent and not protesting at all.

You can be (like me, a lot of the time) a bit of a condescending asshole - but at least don't look like a total moron while doing it. You can't call me an idiot when you are so obviously driven by the current narrative being peddled that you look a bit like a sheep. So, fuck you. I don't support Rhodes Must Fall. I don't support Fees Must Fall. I don't support the neo-Black Lives Matters wannabe dickheads that all seem like dropout BA department idiots.

"Native user interfaces are possible and they have been for months. The complete API is not yet wrapped, but a non-negligible portion is, and it is more than enough to do full user interfaces, and significantly more than the pre-configured dialogs you claim. UiFacade is much more than a pre-selection of dialogs, fullset and fullquery are very, very powerful, and allow you to do much more than just pop up dialogs.

You can invoke arbitrary intents. AndroidFacade and CommonIntentsFacade have a lot of interesting items as well.

I have built full applications in SL4A using Python, something which you seem to have failed at doing. In fact, I spent a while actually getting SL4A's API to work within the PGS4A, so that I can interface with OpenGL and with native APIs simultaneously. 

Additionally, any features which are not currently part of SL4A that you need can be accessed fairly easily by either wrapping the Java calls in SL4A, or alternatively, you can use the ctypes into a C JNI to make calls. It's not necessarily pretty, but most things are covered fairly well by the features which SL4A provides, and things that aren't are often well-received and implemented quickly by the developers.

>you gotta do what you can to draw attention to yourself.

That is true, and trust me, I am doing just that as we speak. How can you argue that relying on brand loyalty will lead to stagnation when you openly admit you have none? Brand loyalty is something you should rely on. I've spoken with CEOs of many billion dollar industries, and they are all concerned PRIMARILY about their brand's image and loyalty. Because if there is a big enough slip, it will damage the brand. 

> even big name brands release promo art and dedicate time and money to drawing in new consumers by appealing to them through design and advertising.

Now that is confusing a marketing strategy with branding itself. Every business will need to advertise, and those are simply effective ways of doing so in this industry. Art and music are used to enhance advertisement, but it does not constitute a brand. There are two questions I suggest all RPG Makers ask themselves to establish a brand. 

What does my game mean to a player? Think back to your most favorite game you have ever played. What did that game mean to you? Your players will eventually be faced with that same question. You will establish your target market with the answer.

How do I want to be known? The answer to this question is the promise you make to your players. Do you want to be known as the guy who turned standard RTP into a work of art or just another would-be developer who spent years on a game nobody will play. What will people think, when they think of you?

Basically, I took issue with 5% of your original argument, and you're acting like I said the whole thing isn't true. The reason that I'm ""only focused on what I wanted to see"" is because I don't take issue with anything else you said. Only that one specific point. "

You keep repeating this condescending remark over and over as if you think you're proving something by it. People aren't all blind followers and you're not the only one with a critical mind. Many prophets of god were born into the religion of god and that fact doesn't make islam any less true.

It is actually choosing one sect. You now become a scholar and clearly see which ones are fabricated and which ones are not. What's the name of the sect you're making up?






>Why exactly?



Because the shia split so many times over choosing their imams each timr the previous one died. And shia came to the hadith compilation and criticism much later and that lost time meant they had no authentic narrations going back to the prophet and the earliest 3 imams. So they became satisfied with narrations going back to only one later imam and they took the doctrine of infallibility and divine inspiration to insinuate these imams actually present a link back to the prophet.







>Which is passed down to them from their fathers a generation by generation, if I'm going to trust absolute hearsay from Sunni books, which had a variety of people each with his own personal motivations, why shouldn't I trust what has been passed down through the generations? That's why I use the tools and methods mentioned above to determine which is most likely true, including cross-examination with various sects.





Go read about hadiths and stop relying on weak ones from other sects.







You still haven't provided which sects you think have authentic hadiths better than sunnis. Which sects you think have better aqeeda or tafsir. You seem to not be able to find any because sunnis are on the right path but you can't help yourself but invent your own sect and adopt new age atheist arguments.

Looks like you spend quite a lot of your time on Reddit, judging from the amount of people you try to ""help"" by being a condescending dick. What you fail to realize is that Reddit isn't the only place where you have to use grammar, and saying that you don't want to focus on your grammar is literally saying ""I don't want to become smarter, I've got shit to do."".

"> I'm not sure this explanation was warranted, as he was just saying he generally solos using the pentatonic scale. For instance, in D minor, he's using D F G A C. This is the basis for his solos, but he also finds that if he does add anything to this set, the added notes tend to be E and B, thus giving you D E F G A B C, or D dorian. If he were adding Bb instead of B natural, then he would be using a D minor scale. See how that works?
 
Of course I understand how that works, no need to be condescending (although I've been called condescending in this thread, so perhaps I shouldn't be allowed to make that judgement). Clearly you can be in the minor pentatonic then add the two pitches 2 and 9 semitones, i.e. a major 2nd and 6th, above the tonic, and, without switching tonics, you'd be in the Dorian mode, but it's highly unlikely that's what the OP's doing. Almost all pop music that uses the pentatonic scale is minor pentatonic over minor diatonic framework. I'd bet that he's not going modal (in his solos, while the backing track is almost certainly minor), and that he's actually just going to the corresponding minor scale or something close to it. (Edit: Even if he was by some strange chance playing only the Dorian mode, that in itself is a huge red flag that he doesn't understand modes.) 

> -adding notes to the pentatonic scale absolutely gives you other scales, one of which is the dorian mode (add major 2nd and major 6th). To accentuate that, you'd want to make sure the harmony that you're playing over uses the same scale, thus giving you an available chord base of i-ii-III-IV-v-vi°-VII, though v is rarely used and would most likely be changed to V.
 
In the Dorian mode, obviously the triads available are i- ii - III - IV - v - vi(dim) - VII. This is trivial. It's the same triads that are available in all modes, just with the numbers rotated so that the Dorian tonic triad is the first degree. 

Then you say the v is rarely used, and it's best to substitute a major chord there. This is just terrible advice. It shows very little actual reflection into when and why musical rules were developed, if those rules are still worthwhile, and what the Dorian mode is. 

Think about why you believe a major chord should be substituted on the fifth scale degree. By doing that you've essentially just changed the Dorian structure to that of the melodic minor, so a better, more-general question to ask yourself would be, why did western composers of the not so distant past almost always alter the minor scale to the harmonic and melodic minor, and how much does this ""why"", even if foolish, still affect our current understanding of music theory? 

In my opinion, your insistence on a major chord rooted on the pitch a perfect fourth down from the tonic, the altered minor scales, and unfortunately many commonly held harmonic and melodic beliefs still held in the music world today are all relics of painfully simplistic, obsolete music theory from the 17th century. 

Once the modern western musical system had been fully adopted, and diatonicism, the most stable 7 note spread, came to dominate all music, the major and minor modes stuck out as the most exploitable (and I mean that in a good way). They both are centred around the identically stable and most stable triads, i.e, the major and minor chords, and have at the most consonant interval from the tonic triads, both ascending and descending, the same triads, i.e. major chords for the major mode and minor chords for the minor mode. This creates a very simple way to define tonality in these two modes: begin and end on the tonic triad (simple repetition of the tonic is maybe the easiest way to imply tonality, one that works equally for all scales and modes, and is used constantly), after playing the initial tonic triad move in some fashion (initially the requirement would have been:move immediately) to one of the other two triads of the same type, then resolve back to the tonic. 

Further, it seems that early ears insisted on the most obvious melodic resolution, which was, once you leave the tonic, the only way to build momentum back towards it was with a leading tone, preferably preceded by a run up of tones (as in 2 semitones) from either the fourth or fifth scale degree (our triads that pivot to the resolution after all) to create a sort of tone-gallup up to the leading tone, which only then do we arrive at the small interval of the semitone. Run as fast as you can to the tonic, slowing down only at the last second! 

Since compositions seemed to require this leading tone melodic resolution, and the harmonic resolution of a like triad either 5 semitones up or down from the tonic, followed by the tonic triad itself, the minor mode can no longer fulfill all the resolution requirements. The major mode still does, but only one of the two resolutions includes a leading tone, the V-I resolution. IV-I no longer is viable. 

But composers also saw that the minor mode had exploitability similar to the major mode (but different). The solution, instead of learning new ways to imply tonality for this distinct mode, was to instead alter the minor mode to be closer to the familiar, safe major mode, so they could more or less operate in the minor mode just as they did with the major. Hence the melodic and harmonic minor scale. 

(Now I'm not saying the melodic and harmonic minor scales are bad, although they do create imbalances in the scale that have to be acknowledged and addressed when composing in them, but they are hugely overstressed even today. We still haven't thrown off those initial tonality defining requirements.)

How long was music almost exclusively composed in the major and altered minor modes? A comically long time. 

Of course, these rules have been softened or totally abandoned over time. We no longer insist on a leading tone for resolution, allowing for the natural minor mode, and four - one cadences. We no longer insist that resolution must come from a like chord, so leading tone resolutions can come from VII(dim)-I, iii-I, etc (though these all have strengths and weaknesses of their own, e.g., in the iii-I resolution only one note moves, the other 2 remain the same, making it feel very still, and not very pronounced). We don't have to start and end on the tonic. etc, etc. Pop music doesn't really care about cadences at all most the time, choosing instead to create tonality through repetition. There have been some attempts to exploit the other modes, particularly in jazz and exotic (Non German!) music. Atonality took hold for a while, most popularly with Schoenberg's 12 tone system, but the parameters there, while they produced some novel, interesting music, were comically restrictive. 

But even as we abandon our initial restraints and open up to more musical possibilities, we are still affected by these early rules, be it consciously or subconsciously. Sometimes when we're not careful we show a heavy unjustified bias in favour of them. 

When you told the OP to use the Dorian mode with a major chord on the fifth scale degree, you were essentially telling the OP, ""here's the Dorian mode, and how you use it is you alter it to be a mode you already know how to use, namely the raised 7th degree makes Dorian the melodic minor, which really, if we're going to be honest, is a scale that was created early in western music's history, in an attempt to make the minor scale work more like the very safe, familiar major scale. So just play Dorian like the major scale. Play safe, don't get hurt."" 

Let's actually play in Dorian. No cheating. Let's find new strengths in the mode that are unique to it, and exploit that. This is actually something that nobody does. Even many of the so called great composers weren't willing to really dig into and analyze the unknown. So what are some unique features of the Dorian mode? One that jumps out to me, is that it is the only perfectly symmetric mode in diatonicism (a feature you're destroying with the V chord), i.e., ascending from the tonic is intervalically identical to descending from the tonic. This symmetry can be exploited easily. In Dorian any set of notes played melodically or harmonically, has an analogous set of notes that are intervalically identical and directionally opposite, which you find by reflecting the notes through the tonic. This could create a strong sense of Dorian. Combine that with the tried, tested, and true tonality creating technique that works for any scale or mode of just playing the tonic a lot, preferably also starting and ending on it, and boom, you're playing in Dorian for real.

">Well...i say things whether its politically correct or not...but people simply have temper tantrums and respond with hatred quite a lot even if what i am saying is indisputable fact.

Its not indisputable fact if science is never on your side.

>For example, i have often taken issue with the idea that white people have 'privilege' or that black people are still oppressed. Many liberals will try to offer the difference in wealth as some sort of evidence that black people are oppressed.



White people still have privilege. Print identical resumes differing only in name and a white guy gets more calls back than anyone else. They are still overwhelmingly in positions of power, and until recently overrepresented in most movies and other forms of media. If a black man and white man do the same crime, the black man will do more time or have a more severe sentence. 

Black people are to this day dealing with the consequences of redlining, voter id laws and manditory minimums just off the top of my head. Sure people dont have seperate drinking fountains, but that doesnt mean 500+ years of discrimination just vanishes in a generation.


>My response, naturally, which i consider to be totally reasonable...is that black people have on average 15 less iq than whites

> Any individual black person could be the most brilliant and civilized person in the nation...individuals imply little to nothing about averages

IQ comparisons always come out. Without fail. And here you go and contradict yourself almost immediately. Does your calculation of racial (geneticists dont think race is a biological construct btw) IQ mean something for every person in the race or not? Whats the value of an average if it says nothing about any black person you meet on the street? Or does it only explain the behaviour of the ones you dont like?

These comparisons are only ever used to psuedoscientifically explain why blacks are inferior and less sucessful, and no amount of mental gymnastics can change that. By contrast, most social scientists are turning around that calculation on its head to point out environmental factors, or studies around discipline as real indicators of future success.

...they drop out of school far more often than whites...they commit crime more often than whites..they have children out of wedlock more often than whites...none of this is behavior is good for building wealth 

Wheel out the Stormfront copypasta why dont you?

> and none if it is the fault of white people.

Im all for not blaming white people for all problems of black people, and i think black people take it too far sometimes. But to say that society pre 1960 has no blame for the plight of black people today is ludicrous.

> Until black people overcome those issues that they have in their own community, we cannot expect that black people will not be underrepresented in any real meritocracy or in equal opportunity.

This is patriarchial and condescending tripe. How much of a burden it must be on you, a white man, to point that out while offering no constructive criticism. ""Sorry, You all have 15 less iq points on average, and all of your problems are your fault and yours alone."" 

> Many people seem to think that such facts imply that all black people are horrible...which is totally false.

">Learn to love yourself instead of hating others

Let's examine this inflammatory and condescending prescription in context of the person delivering it:

 I am not from somewhere people make excuses for their lives, making mistakes continuously, and telling everyone that it is not their fault.

 It is her poverty. It is her low IQ. It is everything except her fault. 

 Trump has a wife who lives in the white house, and even paid off a pornstar! How long would it take you to make that kind of money? Imagine how easy it is to spread your legs and make a few thousand!

"The topic was enemies needing more skill to bring down.

I feel like, as the game stands, we do need more enemies that are hard to bring down. I do not feel this fact is inherently tied to damage mods being a part of the game.

I expressed that I believe (and I still do, in spite of your continued attempts to persuade me otherwise) that damage mods are unrelated to this aspect of game design, and changing them is only tangentially related to enemies which require more skill. I further expressed that I do not believe that a solution to needing enemies which require skill to take down can be reached without ever touching mods, period. 

Popular consensus doesn't make you right, appeal to majority, aka a logical fallacy.


>Like I've said before (please try to listen this time), when people talk about damage 3.0 and what changes they would like to see, it encompasses more than one issue. So, it encompasses mandatory mods, enemy scaling, and skill based gameplay. It is not only one issue. 

I have listened to you enough, and your condescending attitude has earned you a spot on my blocked user list. I've tried to explain to you multiple times that I don't feel this is a problem to solve, it's fine as is, and is unrelated to core issues in the game. You disagree, that's fine. Being a condescending jerk is not. 

The core issue is that enemies are easy to kill, and require little skill. Changing the damage mod system does not change this at all. Freeing up +1 mod slot by any means of rebalancing doesn't change this at all. 

Could they be removed in a theoretical huge revamp? yeah, sure, but it doesn't address the core issue, which is easy to kill, no skill enemies. People will just use... lets see, Ember, Ash, Saryn, Excalibur, Valkyr, Atlas, Nidus, Equiniox.... pretty much any frame, and spam abilities, if enemies don't die to weapons easily.

Oh, but weapons will still do the same damage? Then it was change for change's sake. I feel that the raw damage mods are nice from a player progression standpoint, and serve a valid purpose in character progression, One which outweighs any negatives associated with being down one mod slot. Whether or not you think they're bland or should be baked-in somehow, that's unrelated to the purpose of damage 3.0. Removing them is entirely irrelevant in terms of fixing the game's end game skill cap issues.


Having one more mod to customize with isn't going to suddenly make grineer soldiers any smarter or harder to kill. What solves this problem is new and interesting enemy types which require different tactics to take down.

Regardless of what you think on the matter of ""mandatory"" damage mods, the fact is changing this system would be for it's own sake - there's a reason DE has actively stated they're not pursuing their removal anymore, and are instead focusing on mini boss enemies- because it actually solves the problems that the much-touted ""damage 3.0"" was intended to fix.

">Having 3 dump stats is a pain in the ass to RP and it's obvious cheese most GMs don't want to put up with.

I mean even one dump stat is a pain in the ass to roleplay (for instance, who wants the character with a 5 Charisma), but if you're going to rp them, then rp them. It's up to the player to RP any strengths and weaknesses they have. And maybe it's just me and my groups, but we don't care about having 2 or 3 dump stats.

So are you telling me that I lost the Ordinality by writing out what the stats were, or are you trying to insult my intelligence by trying to point out I spelled Originally incorrectly?

If oppression is the issue, why is this issue being responded to in kind with oppression? And how exactly would a full face veil ban address the issue of patriarchal dominance in someone's private life?

The truth is that this has nothing to do with women's rights, and everything to do with making conservative-leaning Danes feel less uncomfortable about seeing people in full face veils in public life. It's pandering to a crowd that want to limit freedoms for certain minorities and nothing more. 

This is a non-issue in Denmark. c. 200 people wear the full face veil in a country of over 5 million people; there are far more efficacious ways of improving the quality of life for women who may, or may not be, oppressed than by passing draconian laws telling them they aren't allowed to wear what they like.

It's completely reasonable for players to want an explanation from a developer on why a feature has been removed

So you mean they agreed with CA and didn't offer any protest, and so they were reacting appropriately for your liking?

>When Jack explained it here on Reddit, the reception was a bit more critical

Yes, and as we all know potential customers should not be critical of a product.

>what if CA streamlined all features so we only have 1 building and 1 unit in future games'.

I literally never saw this argument in my entire time here. I genuinely think you're strawman-ing this, or taking something one person said and conflating it with the entire community response.

>Others in a knee-jerk reaction felt that this was a betrayal of the community, or that Thrones was already the worst game in the franchise. And finally, a couple of people decided to call for boycotts because these were 'dark times for the TW franchise'.

These reactions were not because of the removal of one feature, but because of the myriad of removed features that occurred in Thrones of Britannia, and because of CA's complete refusal to acknowledge any of the criticism as valid.

>Today, we criticize games after we hear about them from someone else, almost espousing the ideas presented by certain critics - who are, more often than not, fellow gamers like us.

Critics reviews have only come out in the last 24 hours.

>In effect, this leads people to believe that 'removing features in order to focus on new ones' is a bad thing - even though the Saga-series is considered an 'experimental one to look into other areas that TW can delve into'.

The problem is that this ""focus on new"" features really just means adding three or four new features and removing a dozen others. It's really just taking one step forward and two steps back. I don't think any of these features were good enough to justify removing a dozen other features, most of which worked fine in previous titles.

>The moment the average gamer feels that certain steps are easy to do, even though they are not - whether it's due to the game's engine, or programming issues, or the game's overall direction - the average gamer then sets more unrealistic expectations layered on top of the other.

You're treating CA like they're babies. They are not clueless interns scrambling about trying to understand how to do things. They're professionals that have worked in the industry for years. They know how to code and how to design things and how to work with engines. And again you ignored the point I made which is that we aren't even asking for a bunch of new features; most of us just don't want to see older features being thrown out.

FOR MONTHS we have been providing a considerable amount of feedback about what we think does and doesn't work, and where we'd like the series to go, or how CA could change certain things, but here you are saying that ""Actually, guys, all of that feedback is bad and done in the wrong way, because you're too stupid to understand how games are made and are being unrealistic"". How dare you? We are all fans of this series and potential customers of the product CA are releasing; we all have the equal right to have our voices heard. It isn't up to you to arbitrarily decide if our specific feedback is good enough or not. A lot of people have very reasonable feedback, but you're instantly conflating them with the more unreasonable feedback (which is a lot rarer), just because, let's be honest here, it seems like you don't think CA should be criticized, because literally everything you've said in these comments suggests an unwillingness to criticize because every single time we try to do it you'll just say ""Well you're not doing it right"".

>Here's a topic about how to provide constructive criticism for developers as written by an independent developer. Notice how it also points out how we should assume certain changes are difficult, and that we should not get stuck thinking of the 'why' (things happened).

Don't lecture me on how I should or should not offer constructive criticism. I'm a person and I'm allowed to have an opinion and voice it. How dare you condescend to me so much that you're suggesting I don't know how to do it properly, just because you disagree with the content of what I'v said?

">No, their is no reasonable way that April 26 + ""about three weeks"" + ""two months"" = before early July. 

So says you, which isn't a convincing argument given that early July is vague, it's not clear whether two months refers to the meeting with the Russians or the meeting with the Australian diplomat, and you are still making the assumption that the diplomat came forward after WikiLeaks published the emails (rather than Guccifer) even though that is not specified in the article.


>The clear reference to WikiLeaks only further clarifies that

And yet it isn't stated directly.

> the FBI opening their investigation in response in late July only clarifies it further still.

It doesn't clarify anything other than it happened after the time frame for both events.

>I'm well aware that perceived credibility here is more based around contributing to the prevalent narrative than in providing accurate information.

That condescending attitude is pretty unearned when your entire argument is based on your personal inference of a timeline that is not supported by the article.

>The articles reasoning, that the FBI's decision was based on the Aussie info and not Steele's is not supported with any evidence.

Except of course their direct sources, who briefed them on the matter.

"> their season is over unfortunately

Oh yeah, real unfortunate. Is it really unfortunate? For Pats fans? Who's condescending again? "
"Your summarization of my 'main issues' is entirely faulty. I didn't have 'main issues'. I asked for two definitions and evidence for an assertion you made. I then took issue with your response; as part of that taking of issue, I made a few statements which I have backed up.

I never 'dodged' your question about naming a branch of science separate from philosophy. I named ALL OF THEM. You then responded by defining philosophy so broadly that it literally encompasses all of human thought. By that definition, of course there so such thing as a branch of science separate from it. But, crucially: I do not accept your definition of the term.

So, let's be clear: I did not dodge the question.

Here's another example of where you stretch a definition to implausibility to try to remain correct: you say

>there is no predictive difference between Keppler's heliocentric, elliptical model of the solar system and a sufficiently tuned version Ptolemy's geocentric model

as if 'sufficiently tuned' wasn't a gigantic fucking caveat that you NEVER DEFINED. 'sufficiently tuned' in this context could mean anything up to and including 'redefining geocentric to mean heliocentric'. Basically, you just used a broad deus ex machina term to make a sentence mean the opposite of what it should and tried to use that as evidence that you're correct.

Then you go on to say that you 

>never said that atheists need to believe in 'a metaphysics

but in your first comment I quote you as saying:

>it is a positive assertion of the belief in metaphysics

about atheism (or rather your incorrect estimation of what the term means)

So, actually you did say that, which is why I asked for proof.

As for your (once again, needlessly condescending) deigning to finally provide definitions of the two terms, we're not presently discussing the terms themselves yet. we're still discussing the fact that I asked you to define them and how you responded. Now that you have finally defined them, the conversation has moved far beyond them. I'm not prepared to debate those terms with you because we haven't even established a proper format for discussion. 

If we can't come to an understanding of the terms 'atheism' and 'philosophy', then a meaninful discussion of them is impossible.

We've now established that you're using a nearly theological definition of phiolosophy that makes it so broad it applies to everything every human has ever thought about, and I dispute that definition. 

Tabling that, we move on to your definition of 'atheism':

you say:

>I have no idea why so many atheists get touchy when their system is labelled a 'belief'

we do because that's a deliberate misdefinition of the term. Etymologically speaking, atheism means 'the state of not having a belief in deities'. Belief in the colloquial sense of 'accepting as true without proof'. when most atheists say they are atheists, that's what they mean, and everybody knows it. but because people don't like the idea that some people don't need some sort of superstition to get through the dark nights, they falsely accuse us of things to make us more like them...such as the idea that we have some sort of 'anti-belief'...so that they don't have to feel inferior. However, nobody likes to be deliberately misunderstood, and furthermore it implies that the bronze-age dogma of a superstitious person is equal to my reliance on evidential science. Note that I said 'reliance on', not 'belief in'. I rely upon it because it has proven to be effective in the past, and just like all humans I work in a model of the universe that assumes that the past can be used to predict the future. This is not some sort of rhetorical or logical weakness on my part...NOBODY DOESN'T DO THIS. People (like 'philosophers') like to talk academically about other models, but NOBODY LIVES BY THEM. NOBODY USES THEM TO OPERATE IN THEIR WORLD...that is, except certain mentally-ill people, who end up unable to function in society and would die very quickly without protection by those who do use that model.

So, to summarize that point: most atheists get touchy when their system is labelled a 'belief system' because it isn't one. the only parts of it which are 'beliefs' are those we share with literally all humanity. they are not part of the definition of atheism, and so you are misdefining the term and applying that misdefinition to me, which is of course frustrating, as the end result is that you're falsely accusing me.

Finally, your question as to why I'm 'steadfastly' holding to the position that

>science is separate from philosophy

is simply answered: my definition of the term philosophy differs from yours.

you then say that 

>Is there some shame if one isn't on the side of airtight ""real truth""? Hopefully not, as ""real truth"" doesn't exist as far as the best and brightest of our species can tell.

which is an incredibly condescending straw man. I never said anything about some sort of deified 'real truth'. that was something you came up with and are now arguing against. It appears to have something to do with your deliberate misdefinition of 'atheism' as some sort of active action of belief in a 'perfect truth'.

A more accurate summation of my (and many other atheists) views is this: Like all humans, I operate under a specific set of assumptions about the natural world (the past can be used to predict the future, my senses describe a world that actually does exist outside my mind, etc). UNLIKE THEISTS, I DON'T ADD ANY UNTESTABLE SUPERSTITIONS TO THIS WORLDVIEW. There's really nothing more to it. nothing to break down, no action to defend. 

Finally, to respond to your incredibly condescending and insulting reverse argument to authority fallacy: my work and academic credentials are entirely irrelevant, as any scientist will tell you. If my statements are correct, they are correct whether I have a PHD in physics or am a highschool dropout working as a janitor at MIT (how do you like them apples?). The same goes for if they're false, and the same goes for you. If you're wrong, you're still wrong whether you are, as you claim, a mathematics graduate student with a BS in physics, or not.

And you should already know this, which makes me wonder about that particular claim."

Interesting assessment there.

Really? There's a difference between a coach telling his young QB to just learn from his mistakes and telling him to not make any at all. Telling him to not make mistakes can make him 2nd guess his decisions.

>Please tell us the recipe to make a good QB. The answer is there is no single recipe. QBs who start from Day 1 are no more successful than QBs that start later on (drafted in the same area).

">I can tell you have not the slightest idea of how film works.

Interesting conclusion. I'd say I have a better understanding than 85% of the population. Nowhere near what a director, editor or acclaimed writer would have, but enough to ask intelligent questions at, say, Dinner for Five, the Hollywood Reporter roundtables or at any social occasion were I to meet any of the above. Having read and seen a lot of material pertaining to this kind of thing (from the basics of the 36 dramatic situations, 7 basic plots, reading about Tartofsky, Kubrik, Hitchcock ... shit, even knowing what Checkov's gun is puts me in that 15%) and having worked on quite some media material I can say I have a basic knowledge and understanding of film, to say the very least.

>You throw in cinematography and pacing in your review but in reality, if you knew what pacing was then there was no way, in hell, you would agree the pacing was great.

I did not say that. I said in parts it was well done. I qualified it, too: mainly in the first half. You might disagree, but it's up to you to produce counter examples.

>And when you say the cinematographer was a bit mixed, can you elaborate.

I could. But I am not inclined to very much due to your snobby-but-as-yet-unproven superiority claims and the fact that you put me down without a fucking clue about my knowledge or counter in any way.

But I'll give one example: during the initial car-ride-alongs, with the car being seen driving along, the mis-en-scene, the angles the camera used as well as the implied lens (cause it was a composite of so many shots/effects, so talk of a single lens here is ... not relevant), the lighting of the city contrasting with the darkness they accentuated was reminiscent of films like Blade Runner and Collateral.

I use that example because it also added to the tension, the feeling of the city hiding things from our protagonists. The shots and the dialogues complemented each other. 

>And also when you said it was a decent action flick and if you review it otherwise as anything else, you are either ignorant?

Yes. You do not review something like Stalker as an action movie. Or an action movie like Solaris.

Simple primer:

 http 

>Really, because if you knew film structure, you would understand how the action and the pacing work perfectly together. I suggest you watch die hard or the first few lethal weapons buddy.

And this is where I tell you to watch Casablanca, Oldboy, The Maltese Falcon, Dr Strangelove, Alien, Aliens, Terminator 1/2, Buster Keaton movies, Laurel and Hardy and Chaplin, First Blood, Escape form New York, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Errol Flynn movies, the old stopmotion Sinbad, the old Robin Hood movies. 

And if I were rude I'd tell you to fuck off for trying to be so condescending and then coming up with fucking Die Hard without understanding the actual history of action and action movies.

>Really, because if you knew film structure, you would understand how the action and the pacing work perfectly together.

You are conflating things here. Pacing in a film relates to the story beats and how they fit in the overal film's structure. Where the action sequences are in that. Of course, an action sequence has a pace of it's own. But the fact you wrote that sentence that way shows you don't understand how this actually does work. You could not have written that sentence that way otherwise.

>Also, the script is not decent when you have to use more exposition than you need. You know what exposition is right? For example, when they all get in the cop SUV in the beginning to escape, ward tells him to roll up the windows because it's bullet proof. Then the gang members started shooting at them and he said, once again, that they were bullet proof. That's a perfect example of too much exposition because either the writer does not know how to write correctly or he thinks the audience are fucking idiots.

THAT is NOT exposition! It is dialogue where they use repetition for humorous effect! Badly, I will grant you that ... but that ain't exposition per se!

>I'm guessing it's the idiots because you said this was a decent action flick (transformers anyone?).

I detest Transformers. And all but the first Pirates of the Caribbean. And xXx and F&F.

Right, which is the whole point. The point is it is OUR experience and OURS to discuss. Ben Carson may be a total dickwad, but his experience as a person of color is always going to be more valid in an ethnically safe space than that of a white person by virtue of the fact that we are discussing HIS experience. There is no right or wrong way to view how your race has affected your life, and the point of safe spaces is to allow for anyone within the group being protected to be able to voice their feelings regardless of what they are. As I said before, it isn't about protecting an ideology, it's about protecting the ability for members of an ingroup to express themselves free of judgement. assuming Ben Carson can behave himself and not invalidate others experiences', he would be just as welcome into this hypothetical safe space.

Then let them succeed on their own terms instead of pretending that you somehow know better. It's really condescending to assume you have something to teach this movement.

This is where the issue is.

The problem I have with what you are doing, is that you are attributing malice to this when there isn't any, only stupidity, Halon's Razor is a test you need to probably go through before passing condescending judgement on your fellow country men and women.

Normative statement, but I agree with you. I just disagree with the idea that these people chose to have a child. If anything, you should hold the state accountable, because by your logic the state chose to not have them sterilised because they are on the benefit. Look, it has been re-framed, the state is now responsible for children in poverty, do you think this is an unfair statement?

There is no central argument in this case, apart from stating the fact that the Zionist/Israeli narrative is incredibly flawed and omits plenty of facts, especially concerning the riots-- the actions in themselves I don't condone, but I realize they came about for a plethora of reasons, and not, according to flawed Israeli rhetorical revisionist history, because ""Palestinians were/are ANTI SEMITES AND PROTEGES OF HITLER!!! THEY WANTED TO KILL JEWS BECAUSE JEWS!! ISRAEL IS THE LIGHT! THERE ARE NO PALESTINIANS!""

> you keep jumping forth and back on dates, one time it is the British, the other the Zionists 

It's called talking about different events, buddy. Not just fixating on something that Palestinians did (and lying and/or oversimplifying the causes of the specific event) and then saying ""see, this means that (in your case) the Zionist militants were obviously exonerated from any wrongdoing ever and everyone they killed was obviously a jew hater and let's lyingly pretend that the Palestinians just hated jews in general and we won't actually talk seriously about the situation in Palestine prior to the creation of our precious Zionist state"".

> (never the Arabs, mind!)... 

You mean I don't make up lies about innocent Zionists and how the movement was completely benign and everything was the fault of the evil Palestinians.

I don't condone all of the actions of the Palestinians prior to the actual Zionist militant campaigns and the Arab Revolt, and even in those cases, not all of the retaliatory actions that they undertook in response to Zionist attacks. 

However, I actually make an effort to try and understand the situation in a non-polarized, black and white (Zionist) fashion-- and I realize that, as I said, with the riots especially, the causes and how they initiated were far more complex then ""The Palestinians decided to kill some jews because ANTI SEMITISM"".

Of course, anything other then total demonization of the Palestinians is unacceptable to the Zionist Israeli perspective."

It limits the scope of democratic power. The world is collectively realizing the toll that free trade has on working people, the envinonment, small business and so on. Because of that, protectionist policies are growing in populairty. We want functioning nation states with the authority to legislate.

It has also shown how difficult it can be to remove yourself from an existing agreement.

Read back over the conversation and you'll note that the only objection you've had to the idea is that it's ""less convenient"" than the current system, so maybe you should grow up and recognise that you've just said ""it's a shit idea"" and failing to give even a cursory explanation of why, instead going straight for aggressive condescending behaviour.

Sure. What do you do when someone does the obvious and just pastes a fucking picture of themselves onto the badge?

Really, in a digital age the idea of having to have a fucking badge displayed is archaic and inconvenient, not to mention dangerous. If my car insurance people can put a person onto my car insurance with a phone call, a blue badge department could easily put a license plate onto an account with an automated system.

Anyway, you seem to be ignoring that I'm not against alternative ideas. I'm just pointing out you provided none, just said ""that's shit cos inconvenient"". So go ahead and provide alternative ideas if you can be adult about it. I suspect that's not going to happen.

>Your crappy idea is costly, a lot more inconvenient for people who already have a lot of inconvenience in their lives and it is also open to rampant abuse as pointed out in another comment you chose to basically ignore.

"> The point that I started this sub-thread with was regarding humanity as a whole, not the individual. Which was in response to OP saying that men wanting to create offspring is wrong and stupid.

And the point that started this ENTIRE discussion is that OP, an individual, doesn't want children, and was then told that she'd change her mind and, presumably, made to feel ashamed because of her sentiments. As far as men wanting to create offspring being ""stupid"" or ""wrong,"" I would disagree as it is stated here, although I don't believe that this was the initial point of OP's argument. I took it to mean that, essentially, some men (and I would add women here, too), simply make babies for the sake of making babies, without much or any foresight into what that really entails once that child is born. Of course, I could be wrong because I'm not the OP, but that's how I interpreted that statement. 


> The user mentioned ""the ability to reproduce and pass along genetic information"" and was talking about a species as whole. That literaly is on of the requirements for life. None of us mentioned that you are stupid or wrong for not wanting that. That's what you and others inferred.

Why bring up the biological aspect at all, then, if not to subtly throw it in the face of those who choose not to have kids? If Person A says ""I never want to reproduce"" and the response from Person B is ""well, you know, one of the requirements of living is the ability to reproduce and pass on genes,"" that's kind of a condescending rebuttal. Obviously Person B knows that Person A has the ability and is clearly a living human, so why bring it up in this sense? I disagree that there is no inference here of childfree individuals being wrong or weird in their convictions. 

Lastly, I want to (re)iterate that I don't think ANY person, man or woman, is ""wrong"" for wanting or NOT wanting to reproduce, so I don't find it appropriate under any circumstances to foist personal views of something so intimate onto anybody. Just as I would never say to someone trying to conceive that ""they'll change their mind,"" I expect the same in return as far as my life decisions go.

What I do care about is people like yourself interpreting stats incorrectly or ignoring reasons behind them as a way to justify your idiotic opinions and stupid assumptions. Unless the results absolutely, objectively show otherwise the likelihood is that most people just couldn't be assed updating to 1803 - which is a large, feature update that takes a while to install and a conscious effort too. That's down to them but I await your response on how it's 'clearly' a display of hatred toward version 1803 even though there is literally 0 fucking evidence that is damages performance across the board. 

> It's 60% Windows 10, but how many of those are v1607 LTSB and v1703 or v1709 despite the forced upgrades?

Again, couldn't give a shit. You're still attacking the strawman. Go debate forced upgrades elsewhere. 

Now if you want to approach the main point at hand then let's talk about the Intel Microcode updates pushed out recently that patch Spectre and Meltdown (and their variants) that objectively impact performance. That's not Microsoft's fault but I expect you to blame it on them no-less since that's the counter-circlejerk and one which you've made clear that you're very fond of. I would also tell you that there are ways to counter this or even completely remove the performance impact but whether you'd listen is probably up to debate. "
">You focus on race more than anyone really should and its mildly disturbing

That you even have the audacity to say that I'm focusing on race more than anyone really should is such a non-considerate thing to say, there are people that are to this day being negatively affected by racism so how can you even say that, tell me that you're joking because that is a sick comment.

> Now you're making a host of category errors. The difference between humans and a grain of sand is that we think, feel, and make value judgements.

You've misunderstood. I'm not comparing or contrasting humans and sand. It is an analogy to show the scale of what we are talking about. What a single grain of sand is to the Milky Way galaxy, humans are to God. 

> All your argument amounts to is the statement that ""God is such a greater moral being than us that we can't judge his morality."" If that is true, and we have no reference by which to judge God's morality, then you can't determine if he is good or bad.

You're getting ahead of yourself. Try to stick to one question at a time. The question at this time is: Does the created have the capacity to understand the moral integrity of the Creator? You have yet to attempt any answer to that question, and continue to jump 2 questions ahead of the conversation. My 'argument' hasn't stated anything yet, because you have failed to attempt to answer the original question.

> This is a completely untenable definition. It simply doesn't work.

It's not my definition. It's a standard philosophical definition of God that's generally applicable here. This 'discussion' has never attempted to define God in any meaningful sense, but we need some sort of a common framework if we want the conversation to lead somewhere. If the god that you're thinking of is scarcely 'greater' than a human, and the God I'm thinking of so far beyond human understanding that he defies definition, this conversation is completely pointless. 

> this point doesn't knock down or answer the question at hand: If humans lack the ability to judge God's moral integrity, then how can you say that your god is good?

That's not the question at hand, and you've handily included in your question the assumption that 'humans lack the ability to judge God's moral integrity'. If you'd like to have a discussion, let's at least agree on the questions. This question comes later. 

 First - does the created have the capacity to understand and judge the moral integrity of the Creator 
 Second - on what basis does the created judge its own moral integrity?
 Third - Depends on the answer to 1 and 2, but probably something along the lines of... Is the basis by which the created judges its own moral integrity able to be extrapolated and applied to the Creator? (Hint - that's your question without the built in assumptions and the condescending tone.)

> These questions are utter nonsense. Sand doesn't make value judgments. The Milky Way doesn't make value judgments.

Agreed. It's an analogy to show the scale of the conversation. Humans are 'as sand', God is 'as the Milky Way'.

> If I accept your analogy, then you are the grain of sand. On what basis do you claim that God is good? If you do not claim that God is good, then why is he worthy of worship?

Correct. I am the grain of sand. As I've said a few times, you're getting ahead of yourself. This question comes later. 

I don't mind continuing this conversation, but if you continue to simply ignore the questions then this will be my last response. It may also be more beneficial for you to start your own thread, where you can begin with the question you really want to ask (Why do Christians claim that God is good?); instead of hijacking OP's thread and having to try to force the conversation in a direction that it wasn't really headed in the first place.

"> Oil operates at a significant tax-advantage over other industries

No, it really does not. That's what I've been trying to explain to you. But you are too bullheaded to accept the facts that disagree with your indoctrination. You have not provided a single shred of evidence that the oil industry gets any more favorable tax advantages. I've shown that they do not and that most large companies actually operate at a tax disadvantage where they are denied the normal expensing deductions that other industries are afforded. So, we are at an impasse. You think you know what you are talking about but clearly do not. You refuse to be persuaded by any evidence, you talk about how the accounting is different but yet provide no evidence beyond your opinion, and to top it off, you still act condescending and try to cover your obvious ignorance with false bravado. Like I said, the depth of your indoctrination is embarrassing. Here are some articles that can help you out. I've extracted some key points. Read up and remedy your ignorance:

Debunking the big-oil subsidy myth

> CAP shrewdly - but inaccurately - conflates two completely different terms in public finance: subsidy and deduction. A subsidy is a payment made by the government, usually to promote the prospects of a specific technology or action - be it solar energy, ethanol or something else. Subsidies are often equated with handouts - a derisory term for sure.

> A business deduction, on the other hand, is designed to ensure that a firm is taxed only on its net income. Deductions allow businesses to write off legitimate expenses from gross revenue to calculate net income. Deductions are widely regarded as proper in a system that taxes income, not revenue.

 http 

> On average, the industry pays a 45% tax rate when all state, federal, and foreign taxes are totaled up. By comparison the Healthcare Industry pays a total rate of 35% and the Pharmaceuticals pay an estimated rate of 21%. Based upon these numbers it’s hard to believe which business sector is criticized the most for “subsidies”.

The article also breaks down and explains all the phony ""subsidies.""

"> No, it's really really not.

Uh, yeah it is. You compared a person torturing and murdering while being a good father and volunteering in a soup kitchen to a person who is torturing while also freeing tens of thousands FROM torture, rape, mistreatment, and ownership. 

> Torture is fucking evil. It is not justified, excepting situations where it is guaranteed to be effective at preventing a catastrophy of enormous proportions (atomic war, pandemic, or other extinction event.)

Sure, I can agree with you that in our modern world, torture is, in the large majority of cases, in no way shape or form to be condoned. 

> Dany's situation didn't even come CLOSE to justifying the torture of YOUNG GIRLS, just to inflict psychological damage on their father to get him to talk, because he MIGHT know SOMETHING about a few resistance freedom fighters who were killing ARMED MILITARY POLICE of an invading occupational force.
> That act is Evil. Period.

They were not only killing armed military police. She ordered the torture after these rebels found and killed ordinary civilians who had been freed from slavery. In fact, she ordered it after she found out that they had tortured one of those civilians, Rylona Rhee, by chopping off each of her fingers before killing her. 

And are you really saying that killing the Unsullied is OK just because they're part of Dany's army? Are you actually justifying murder here? What kind of fucked up scale do you have where torture is somehow worse than murder?

> To suggest otherwise is to put yourself on a level equal to the Masters you applaud her for betraying, deposing, and murdering.

No. It doesn't. Denying that torture is evil wouldn't put me anywhere near that level, even though I'm not doing that. You don't get to just make assertions willy nilly and pretend they're true.

> Let me repeat that: if you and I were in this world, and you committed the acts you describe (torturing little girls) I would kill you out of hand, and feel no guilt about it.

Good to know that you would kill me without ever knowing the full details. You sound like a trustworthy person.

""It's a game,"" is actually a common reply to people's complaints about rules.

Check Paizo's boards during any of the new class playtests. It's a phrase used everywhere people are bitching about things that are fine.

>Vanish is negated by acting in a hostile manner, and is rendered worthless by verbal components.

>At the very worst, the always unoptimized blaster caster will do roughly 50% more damage than usual once. And only under very specific circumstances. Boo hoo.

First of all, that's not nothing, and it's going to happen every time there's an arcane caster capable of pulling it off, which is 100% of the time. It's a balance issue now, and being a Stealth blaster is suddenly very optimized.

Unless they have an INT < 10, they're going to exploit that weakness by denying the party the ability to see it coming every time. Vanish is just one of dozens of ways a caster could do this. Using Blur and a good Stealth roll, they could use the sniping rules to do this as many times in a combat as they have Fireball memorized. Even easier when you can't save for half (or none) because it doesn't take many Fireballs to get the job done. Which says nothing about flying casters with Improved Invisibility_.

It's not trivial, no matter how condescendingly you phrase it.

Once more you reveal that you're a low level player. This has nothing to do with spawns.

 If you're going to do this based on which spawn you have, say, doing it when you have a bad spawn and not doing it when you have a good spawn, that's giving the enemy even more information. Either they can play knowing exactly where your team's AWPer is because he shot from containers or they know he had a good spawn and is going for a peek somewhere.

This is incredibly condescending and ridiculous, and it's honestly shameful that you are trivializing other people's experiences of trauma to perpetuate the narrative that rape is the worst thing that can ever happen to a person.

The fact that you think being raped is something that you build your identity around, but that suffering a debilitating car crash, battling cancer, losing a child, etc. are incomparable in terms of suffering lets me know all that I need to know. I've been raped. It's a footnote in my life. Some people are still dealing with the physical repercussions and the emotional scars of their trauma. I consider myself lucky that my rape was just a rape and there were no STDs involved, that I didn't get pregnant, and that the physical violence was only threatened and never enacted, and I completely understand that in different circumstances, I might be suffering more lasting effects. But it's demeaning to decide for all rape victims all over the world how they need to feel about what happened to them.

I'm not mad at the Catholic church for the fact that their priests rape little kids, any more than I get mad at certain public school systems for having paedophile teachers. I am mad that that Catholic Church routinely COVERS UP for child rapists, and then blames the secular, non-religious world for the fact that they have priests raping kids. I'm pissed because the Catholic Church refuses to admit that IT HAS A PROBLEM, and refuses to ACT on FIXING that problem, instead blaming the VICTIMS of their rapist priests for the rapes!

>Let me know when you graduate college, settle down, and get some friends outside your comfort zone.

And here we go, the usual personal attacks. Do you even listen to yourself when you talk?

It's always amusing when right wingers try and talk condescendingly to those opposing them considering that there is a very good chance that those they are arguing against are significantly better educated and informed and all around more educated about opposing opinions and positions.

I have heard literally everything you just said in your comment at least a dozen times. I have thoroughly argued against people like you countless of times. I am acquainted and have discussed these topics with countless of people in real life, too. It's hard to escape them when working in an English speaking country.

But hey, them believing that it's OTHERS who are less informed and reasonable might have something to do with their aversion to facts and evidence. They simply don't know any better.

Feel free to research these topics and every statement I just made which I guess you will decry as ""partisan"" or ""offensive"" or ""not politically correct"" or ""unreasonable"" or ""childish"" even though the statistics on these matters are quite clear and telling.

Chances are that I am more educated, richer, more travelled, more knowledgeable, more experienced, more exposed to differing opinions, and just all around a more well-rounded and more open and more reasonable individual. Want citations for any of that?

Me not taking kindly to people who support right wing ideology might have to do with the fact that they are evidently harming the society I am a part of and the planet I live on and maybe with the fact that they are evidently a threat to my health and future as well as that of my family and the fact that they destabilize societies worldwide and massively hold back progress. Want any citations for that?

>You may discover that the strawmen the media presents rarely reflect reality. 

What straw men? What media? Nothing I said is related to the media or anything the media says. You should also stop reflecting... just because right wing media rarely, if ever, tells the truth, it doesn't mean that all media is the same. On average, even left wing rags are better than the most reputable right wing publication, by virtue of supporting superior policies alone. 

In the meantime, the media is irrelevant to this conversation.

"Ok, you want to talk definitions?

Actual motion = kinetic motion. 
Potential motion = potential motion. The latent ability of matter to behave a certain way. 

When you ask me to prove that the sequence of motion cannot extend ad infinitum, I'm not sure what you mean. The universe as we understand it has an endpoint, I assure you, because of the decaying of matter. It's going to be an unfathomable amount of time, but that will happen. But that's just one example. 

When I wrote ""this everyone understands to be God"" it was literally directly from the argument of Aquinas. If you'd like me to change my diction, I could say ""the being in question"" or ""what we're talking about"" instead of ""God"" in that sentence. 

> But you also said ""nothing can move itself""... in which case something else must have moved the first mover.

You're right - if this mover were just another causal link in this infinite regression, I'd be able to say that something must have first done something to it. And then you can continue asking the question ""well what moved it and what moved that and what moved that"" etc etc. The point of the logical implication that this god exists is that it is not part of this regression - it exists as something that always had existed and will always exist. It does sound like something that is easy to refute, because such a being sounds at first ridiculous to you and me. ""Why are we coming up with these pie in the sky gods to explain the world when we just have to say that we just don't know all of the world yet"". That sounds reasonable to me.. but from a logical standpoint - the logical proofs presented - it's pretty fucking difficult to refute them. 

And if you want to get condescending, I can play ball too. Oh wow, you recognize that since we're talking about arguments here, you can throw around the terms ""self-contradictory"" and ""unfounded premises""! You're right, it truly makes me sound like a dum dum when you say that my premises are unfounded. 

There are 3 components to a sound argument: True premises, a true conclusion, and a conclusion that follows from the premises, logically (the validity of it). Hate to break it to you, but what you meant to say was that, based on what you said, it's my logic that's invalid. In fact, if what you wrote is your argument, you accept my premises.

The United States are still the United States, Constitution of 1787 or not. The U.S. Code and other laws and treaties can serve to protect the country while the country starts over in drafting a new constitution. The US is formed by the Declaration of Independence. This is a nation of laws. Those laws do not go out the window when a new system of organization takes place. We did this once before. It's way past time to do it again. Until a new constitution is agreed upon, the old one can remain. Hell, you could even write an amendment that consists of an abolishment of the old and the text of the new constitution.

You might as well argue that we shouldn't talk about poverty, because by acknowledging that there are lots of poor people we are only going to divide this country more. This country isn't divided because we acknowledge racism, it is divided because a huge portion of the population refuses to acknowledge racism and completely ignores the desperation of everyone else.

>There is no such thing as ""white discrimination"" or ""reverse discrimination"".

Tell that to the Right - they are the ones constantly asserting otherwise.

>And some government policies do discriminate against white folks.

No they don't. The idea that white people are facing discrimination simply because the government is trying to stop racism is like arguing that giving money to the poor is discrimination against the rich. 

>by making race a factor in order to ""make up"" for past historical events is a fruitless and in this case divisive solution

No, it is not. It only earns animosity among white Right-Wingers. I, as a Mexican, am far happier with my government and my country for tackling this issues head on. If the government worked like you want it to - that is to say completely ignoring the structural problems of our society because talking about them upsets white people - I would be far more contemptuous of our government than I am.

> I maintain the only way to get people to stop looking at color as a factor is to lead by example. 

I don't worship the State. I view it as a corrupt institution that serves a tiny portion of the population over the rest of us. I don't think there are many people who look to the State for an example of how to live in the United States - except for the bizarre wing of the Right which some how equates rejecting government power and indoctrination as constantly drooling over the military and basing all their beliefs on what a handful of dead politicians thought a few centuries ago. 

>Actually I can. And I will. 

Then you are being entirely irrational. If the government forces private companies to hire more minorities, then by definition they will have more minorities in their ranks than they would without them. The fact the Right equates such quotas as preventing white people from entering the workforce only underlines the fact that they want those jobs to go to white people.

> maintaining that somehow race is a factor when it comes to employment.

It is a factor - we just established that. The fact that people are discriminated by how their names sound is just one of the barriers non-whites face when getting employed. Plugging your ears and pretending that is a factor and that the only reason people face discrimination is because the government tries to stop discrimination is contradictory at best.

>The government is sending the message to employers and the people that ""underrepresented minorities"" are somehow inherently inferior to everyone else and need special treatment in order to be competitive.

No, it is not. It is sending the exact message we have been talking about: that racism is still an issue, that it causes discrimination in the workforce, and that something must be done to combat it. Your entire argument as to why such actions by the government are bad hinges on whether or not the masses see it your way - they don't. 

>I am Colombian and German. You can't imagine how much crap I got as a kid with that combo

Every time I talk to a Right-Winger about racism, they are all brown and their parents are civil rights activists or something like that. I think you're lying and won't take you seriously if you go that angle.

> People are going to be shitheads no matter where you are at. 

Then your idea that racism is going to disappear simply if the government ignores it is faulty.

>Europe is portrayed as this Nirvana of racial purity, yet they are some of the most racist folks in the planet. 

Don't care, not relevant.

>Things may seem bad here in the US, but compared to most parts of the world, we are relatively stable despite our diversity.

Ha, bullshit.

>Again, you have this notion that there is this huge group of support that is a super majority in this country, typical mentality of someone who hasn't really traveled and seen the country. 

First and foremost, I don't appreciate you being entirely condescending about where I have been and what I have done. 

Second, you have completely missed my point. I am not talking about how much political influence minorities have, I am talking about the difference between how you think you're a champion of equality and how those who are treated as unequals view your cause. It says something very significant about how legitimate your beliefs are when the people who suffer from racism think you are the most racist political group.

>80% of the country is white. Assuming every single latino is white, 65% of the country is non-hispanic and white.

Ah yes, for all the huffing and puffing about not seeing race, the argument is still that skin color determines whether or not a person can accept a particularly view point. 

> I also totally understand racism and the feeling of overwhelming anger and helplessness it makes you feel. You aren't talking to a naive white kid who hasn't even crossed the Mason-Dixon line.

No, you don't. You're a condescending white person who fundamentally believes that my perspective is invalid and frivolous - who will tell me I can't imagine the crap he receives because of his heritage but who ""totally understands"" the things I deal with. Your position is the epitome of naivety - rather than treating racism as a multifaceted issue that can't be rooted out through talking alone, you think telling minorities to make peace with being discriminated against and telling white people to pretend racism doesn't exist will some how make us a more integrated and cohesive society. It won't. You can't even talk to me - a single person - in a manner that makes me think you care about the totality of this country. "

">I'd love some proof on that first point. 

Well most companies fail in the first 4 years. Something north of 80%. Most companies in the US are not fortune 500 companies. So if most of these companies are failing in a short amount of time, their CEOs aren't retiring. The CEO is the same person as it was when the business began, probably the founder of the company. When they select a CEO in one of these massive companies that have been around forever, they typically are chosen from among the board or directors or by the board of directors. They are also people who have either been on the executive management of that company for years, or have been in executive management positions of other successful companies. It is also interesting that people only care about the CEO position. The female population of other executive positions (CFO, COO, vice presidents of various focuses) are ignored even though they make far more money and have far more power and influence than the average man. Male CEOs are statistically no different than male homeless, the average male will not end up being either one. Women don't complain that the incarcerated population, homeless population, or hard laboring population are mostly male. They only care about the very top position in the most profitable firms. It's really hilarious to me.

On the off chance that you are just naive, I will try to help you. ComedicSans may not have put it in a way you liked, but they're right: you sound like an asshole. Tone can be conveyed through text. For example, you seem to have read the logical fallacies page of wikipedia recently and/or a lot. Above, you said that ComedicSans was appealing to authority.

You were called condescending because you told a person who has worked in a field with sexual assault survivors to read a basic text book.

Between that and ""debating encourages thinking if you take it seriously,"" your tone is generally condescending.

Sadly, when the person you were writing to told you that she felt condescended to, rather than acknowledging your original ignorance and apologizing, you let your emotions get the best of you. You were attacked in other threads, so you responded hostilely. Can you imagine how differently the conversation could have gone if, rather than fighting, you had agreed with her that the book was excellent? And acknowledged her expertise on the topic, which outweighs your own?

This subreddit often responds positively to people who arrive and are the subjects of drama and can have a laugh at themselves. Everyone has a bad day on the internet. You showed no signs of this. In fact, you show signs of being someone who has a very hard time EVER laughing at themselves. 

The pomposity of your language, your insistence that people explain their reactions to you, your insistence that people explain away what you perceive as moral relativism on their part in a subreddit where the comment tone is almost universally more light hearted (""this is good for bitcoin!"") - all of this indicates to me someone who has connected their intellect so tightly to their self worth that they simply cannot let go, even when the preponderance of evidence indicates that they may be in the wrong.

I would recommend a program of mental exercise for you. Begin by acknowledging the intelligence of others, especially in areas that are not considered ""smart"". For example, someone knows how to fix your car. Maybe you don't. Society may not value that as highly as theoretical physics, but that person's particular expertise certainly exceeds your own, and should be respected. Extend your empathy more often. Good luck.

Furthermore, a disengagement with further argument does not constitute a surrender to any flaws in my comment that you may find.

>GeForce GTX 1080, on the other hand, is not faster at FP16. In fact it’s downright slow. For their consumer cards, NVIDIA has severely limited FP16 CUDA performance.

>There is no electric vehicle on the planet that can do what is BASICALLY required for the job.

If you mean front end loading and excavating, I'd wager you're right. If you mean driving up to the worksite in something big, shiny, and loud that will impress everyone you work with, you're probably also right. If you mean hauling up to 80,000 lbs of tools and equipment around, well Tesla already has an electric truck that will do that. If you mean sturdy off-road-ready construction and an impressive tow capacity, I already linked the truck that should be ready to do that within the next year.

>It's not in a city.

Ah, so you're one of the many construction workers who builds brand new cities from scratch in an area with no infrastructure whatsoever. You and a team of five guys drive out into the middle of the wilderness, and six months later, BOOM! fully developed metropolis ready for moving in. 
Or by, ""It's not in a city,"" did you just mean ""it's in a rural area where houses with running water, electricity, and indoor plumbing with a paved road at the end of their driveways might be a mile or two apart""? Because on a recent road trip from Bumfuk TN to Bumfuk AL, I passed a Cracker Barrel at least once every 50 miles (ALL of which have electric charge stations). 
By the way, as I can and practically feel a condescending ""you city folk don't know what it's like to live in the country"" attitude radiating off your statement, I should probably let you know that I was in Bumfuk Tennessee because that's where I live. About a mile from my house, not only can you not get home internet, you can't get cell service on any carrier. But weirdly, everybody still has electricity.

>There will NEVER be electric stations with the prevalence of gas.

There's already electricity with at least the prevalence of gas stations. Which, along with a SINGLE outlet that I would hope someone who ""runs a construction company"" would be able to figure out how to wire up, is all you need to charge your vehicle at high speed. Or, if you're going to be parked at a work site all day anyway, you can charge the vehicle with an ordinary outlet.
And supply will meet demand. There weren't always gas stations everywhere. As gas cars started going everywhere, people opened up businesses to support them. The same can, will, and IS happening with electric charging stations. Faster than it did with gas, because you don't need a any more infrastructure than electric power lines in order to get one up and running.

You think $6 Billion annually would cover it? Because that's around ONE PERCENT of what we spend on the military.

These results occur without furthering any legitimate state purpose.""

Judge Dale, Idaho; ""'preserving the traditional institution of marriage’ is just a kinder way of describing the State’s moral disapproval of same-sex couples."" the practical effect of Idaho’s same-sex marriage ban ""is 'to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma' on a class of people based solely on their sexual orientation,""

"> When you don't read music, you're not a whole musician.

See, there you go. You are a condescending music snob who went through years of schooling and classical training and didn't get anywhere. You are obviously just jealous that there are people who can pick up an instrument, create a song, and become successful because they use music to express themselves in a way that is liked by millions of people around the world... all while never learning how to read or write standard notation.

> It's hurting your own development, and it's disrespectful to the people who have to spoon feed you.

No, it's not at all. I don't play in the classical genre. Therefore, standard notation is not needed. Furthermore, I am more than happy to teach someone how to play a song, it's part of the development process between musicians who play and jam together. It's not seen as ""disrespectful"" at all.

> Just because you don't know the names of the hundreds of classical musicians who made the Beatles what they were... They still existed. They still worked hard. 

Now you are just creating a straw man. I never said the Beatles created their songs out of thin air, I totally understand the history of music and how every musician (regardless of being able to read or write standard notation) before another influences the latter. Classical music is just as important in the progression towards 20th century genres as the Gregorian chant was to classical era and the later romantic era.

Lastly, based on the logic from your argument, the Blues is not music because it was created by people (slaves, free slaves, and blacks) who couldn't read or write standard notation. Since these people couldn't read or write standard notation, they weren't ""real musicians,"" they were just hobbyists."

Here's what I love about your response: I get to blow it up immediately and on it's face as being both condescending, insulting and completely beside the point. First, my time at A&M straddled the end of the Fran years and the beginning of the Sherman years, a terrible era of football to be sure. However, I was an Aggie long before that since my dad was a class of the early 70's. I started watching college football in earnest in the early 2000s but had been exposed throughout the 90s. I've seen Aggie Football at it's highs and lows. As a result, we can pretty conclusively determine that my exposure to the Aggie program prior to this has nothing to do with my viewpoint now. While I'm more than happy to respect your point of view, your decision to talk down to anyone who doesn't agree with you by belittling it based on what their context is, at best, ad hominem and entirely irrelevant to the discussion at hand. My suggestion is to keep your arguments on topic.

> It's tough to win consistently in CFB. It's even harder to win consistently in the SEC West. I know you want to be on the level of Bama/LSU, but that isn't just going to happen overnight and may not happen at all.

I appreciate your viewpoint but, frankly, it seems to be extremely accepting of mediocrity and regression. I can appreciate that we didn't have these expectations prior to 2012 but, even then, the thought process was a five or six year curve to become legitimately competitive for the division and the conference. Guess what? We're officially in year four and moving towards year five and the trend appears to be a regression rather than improvement on offense. Moreover, it's extremely clear the offense has real problems centered around the OC. If those problems aren't fixed, we will miss our best shot at a conference title (and potentially the playoffs) that we'll see until at least 2018/2019. Moreover, we may not have the firepower to make that happen at that point if recruiting takes a step back because the program appears to be regressing, which brings me back to my point. Are we supposed to simply accept regression because Johnny changed expectations? Frankly, I'm not so sure the expectations really changed for 5 or 6 years down the road. Even Sherman projected a 5 or 6 year progression to become competitive for a conference title. 

Here's what I want to see: progress, preferably progress that is more or less on schedule. What I don't want to see is clear signs of regression or problems that we refuse to solve when they become apparent (E.g., Spav still being the OC). I'm not ready to call for Sumlin's head. I'm actually almost certain that is a straw man because I really haven't seen anyone outside TexAgs call for Sumlin's job and certainly not on reddit. Now, given that Spav is still calling plays, I am ready to start taking a closer look at Sumlin and considering whether he's got what it takes to get us to our goals, which are pretty clearly to win conference championships and make the playoffs. If you don't understand those are the goals you haven't been paying attention because I can assure you those big money donors were promised hardware if they would open their wallets for that shiny new stadium and facilities and DC we have. In short, regression is simply unacceptable at this juncture."

But if long winded is the way we shall go then, I would like to point out - that three seconds or two seconds are very commonly spoken of as a general rule under slightly different contexts, and certain regions will lean towards one or the other.

But since this is for intent and purpose semantics around an understood reality: People need to give more followign distance, can we leave it at that?

Ausie website

And if we look at the wiki article on it... - it even notes that it is interchangable with the three second rule and vice versa. It's a rule of thumb for general guidance.

And it's core intended purpose - all semantics aside: Give reasonable following distance so IF YOU NEED TO, you CAN stop or otherwise avoid a collision.

>That must be your own interpretation. Perhaps next time you can make that clear for me.

Is that a long winded enough, extra clear clarifying way of putting it?

Oh to hell with it, let me just pull the first chunk of that wiki article:

>The two-second rule (also known as the three-second rule in some states) is a rule of thumb by which a driver may maintain a safe trailing distance at any speed.

Yes... I know this. There is always a negotiation, except Liverpool isn't negotiating. They have said that they will only seriously consider offers around £50m. Arsenal, if reports are believed, have submitted 4 offers; £30m, £35m, £40m, and £40,000,001m. All of these were rejected with the same response - offer £50m or get out. Arsenal hasn't done that yet. 

> If he wants to show that he ""isn't fucking around"" then he should send Arsenal's MD or Chairman a letter, fax, or email simply stating that he absolutely will not accept any bid of less than £XXm, and that he will not entertain any future bids under that amount.

Really? The LFC fans fucking love this. After having such crappy owners in the past and some people thinking Henry was only in this for the money, the tweet has really endeared himself to the fans. He has already officially refused the offer and stated that he will only consider them for more than £50m.

2) I'm gay and I like to see gay relationships. I like it when what I do is on the TV. That's actually really normal behavior. It's not for the sake of blind progress, it's ""Oh hey that's a thing I do!""

Think of him as you please, but calling in reactionary is just plain wrong. Being reactionary implies wanting so mantain the status quo, Digi wants the opposite of that, always wanting shows to do something different and trying to enjoy shows from a different perspective.

> Everything that he puts out is stamped with his stereotypical angst and because of that he, more often than not, doesn't ever add anything new to the conversation.

The part about not adding anything to the conversation is whatever, it's your opinion but the ""Everything that he puts out is stamped with his stereotypical angst"" tells me you haven't watched most of his videos, and your main avenue of exposure to him is throughout reddit, (which isn't necessayly a bad thing, but does limit your perspective), because most of his videos are, in fact, positive, about shows he loves, finds interesting, or people he likes, sometimes all 3.

> Digibro is just not someone you want to have dictate new ideas and positions, because 9 times out of 10 those positions are ""This sucks and if you like it, you suck"".

First of all, again, this is wrong, go watch most of his videos and would see why, second, never once, throughout all is channels and content, did digibro ever insult anyone for likng something he doesn't, never, digibro ain't theanimesnob, he doesn't think his opinon is fact. The guy as an entire video on why objectivity doesn't exist for fuck's sake.

> EDIT: I should also point out that Digibro is banned from /r/anime for a reason. None of the other anitubers are, so ask yourself: why Digibro? It's definitely not just because he kept propping up his own videos. There was more to it than that, and a lot of it had to do with his attitude.

There is no rule that every movie should provoke the viewer intellectually, Transformers wildly succeeds at the most basic filmmaking factor - entertainment. You continue to criticize Transformers for unrelated aspects - like judging a fish on its tree climbing ability. 

And you can't seriously drone on about 1) ""recycled stories"" and then praise Mad Max as if a post-apocalyptic narrative where supplies are short and survivors looking for a fertile land is some groundbreaking idea in cinema that Fury Road brought to the table. And 2) Tom Hardys spectacular performance... I loved Bane as much as the next guy but Hardy spoke maybe six words in Mad Max and could not maintain an accent. He's a fine actor, but his minimal, ""too cool for school"" persona isn't that impressive. Same goes for Theron, though she certainly had much more character development (Max had practically none). Hoult did an excellent job of making me think he was insane, I'll give you that.

Furthermore, how are you supposed to have access to your gun fast enough if you need it. 

Many states already require a hunter safety course to get a license. Why is something similar that outlandish for just gun ownership? As it is I can buy a gun and keep it loaded with a round in the chamber and think that is the right way to keep a weapon because no one has told me different. A little education could cut accidents. As for the safe I think could be useful, if you live in a neighborhood that is bad enough you feel the need to be within arms reach of a weapon at all times it might be a good idea to secure the guns you own that you aren't actively carrying.

It is possible that the past tense is due to a change between when Jesus was there and when John was written, not a change before Jesus was there? verse 5 is telling of this in the NIV.

>5 One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.

It is also past tense. So he used to lay there too. He was there previously, but not when Jesus was there. Or it is past tense from the writing, not the event.

"Am I still talking to the same person? You just listed a bunch of reasons women are less fit than men, and every single one is the result of a hormone that begins production during puberty, as I already said. If these hormones are blocked during puberty, and testosterone is given, and then surgeries to meet asthetic standards for genitalia etc, and then congrats mom and dad, she's a boy. 

>Skeletal composition (ability to carry heavier objects, like weapons and equipment, and wounded men with their weapons and equipment.)

- Gender: Peak bone mass tends to be higher in men than in women. Before puberty, boys and girls acquire bone mass at similar rates. After puberty, however, men tend to acquire greater bone mass than women.
Source:  http 

>Lung capacity (ability to carry those wounded men out of danger.)

- This one I'll give you, lung capacity is fundamentally different as a result of neonatal differences in boys and girls, not pubescent ones. So upon trying the entrance exam, women COULD just train their VO2 a little harder to make up for the notably small difference in lung capacity. Look at the difference between male and female elite marathoners, it's not a very large gap, just because you're born with one (keep reading, you'll only get have this one) slight disadvantage doesn't mean you can't make it up. 

>Body fat (women have more body fat than men.)

- On average, women have 6 to 11 percent more body fat than men. Studies show oestrogen reduces a woman's ability to burn energy after eating, resulting in more fat being stored around the body.
Source:  http 
The result of hormones at puberty, another one down.

>Menstrual cycle (chicks bleed monthly.)

- This is inherently hormonal, and anybody without a degree in biology for smartasses will tell you that girls don't menstruate until they hit puberty. This is a moot point, and maybe you didn't catch the discussion that lead me to say what you so condescendingly disagreed with, that a trans male can be born female, have hormone blockers stop the production of estrogen and it's friends, and then start taking testosterone and have gender reassignment surgery, and be essentially the same (minus the one point you made that was academically valid). 

>I'll say it again, for the cheap seats: Our differences are more than just hormonal. When you pass Biology 084, you can then apply for Bio 099. AFTER that, you will be ready for Freshman level courses. Good luck, please pay closer attention this time.

>It's a logical error to assert actions of others don't impact you as indirect impacts can be of the very same severity as direct ones.

It's also a logical error to deploy straw men. I never said that actions of others don't impact the average person. I said those actions and impacts will occur regardless of whether the average person understands them. For example, right now there is a man who works as a greeter at WalMart. He wakes up in the morning, hands people shopping carts, cashes his paycheck, pays his rent and goes to bed. He couldn't explain accounting or evolution, yet accountants and scientists still perform their jobs, and that work has an impact on his life, just as well without his input. Human progress marches onward while he remains blissfully unaware of the struggles it faces. Some people are smart enough to get PhD.'s or CPAs, and others hand out shopping carts. Specialization of trade. 

You seem to assert that people need to understand evolution in order to benefit from the scientific benefits that have been derived from it, but medicine cures the ignorant as effectively as the educated. (Your argument is also odd in that you seem to simultaneously assert that everyone must learn evolution, but that the ""average person's opinion on the matter shouldn't be sought out"", which doesn't seem to comport, but we'll get to that.)

>accounting does have an incredible impact on your life, once again you're assuming something doesn't simply because you know nothing of it, a case of prideful ignorance if ever I saw.

I am an accountant, so maybe my assumptions of prideful ignorance are both contagious and transmittable electronically. Regardless, once again, I never said things people don't understand don't have an impact on their lives. I said those impacts occur regardless of their level of understanding. Same straw man, new clothes. 

>Also yes we would prevent the teaching of non-mathematical based systems 

Really? How or when has this ever occurred? The SEC wouldn't allow a publicly traded company to use non-FASB standards, and banks wouldn't forbid but probably wouldn't be interested in doing business with companies that determine investments by ""throwing goat bones,"" but absolutely no one would try to stop anyone if that is how they ran their business. (Hell, it's rumored that Reagan based foreign policy on astrology, and no one stopped him. Kind of scary.) 

>just like with evolution there is no alternate theory of accounting.

While we're on the topic, double-entry bookkeeping accounting wasn't devised until the Middle Ages. And almost no one outside the accounting profession understands or uses double-entry bookkeeping. And they almost uniformly only account for things on a cash basis, so there are a large number of ways to do accounting. But why torture this analogy any further?

>Another massive logical fault in your argument is that of knowing about something being equal to impact.

Again, not my point. Once again, my point is that impacts occur regardless of an individual's level of knowledge. You must be running low on straw at this point. 

>For the last point I think it's extremely clear that the opinions of unqualified people do not matter

Then why do you care if they believe in creationism? Why can't everyone in Arkansas read the book of Genesis for high school? If their opinions don't matter, who cares? (Since you seem confused on this point as well, I do not support teaching creationism.)

>I don't ask my plumber for a medical assessment

And you don't ask your Walmart greeter to breed a mosquito incapable of transmitting malaria. Not that his opinion matters anyway. (Once again, I'm opposed to teaching creationism.) 

>If you aren't aware [of] how evolution impacts the world, or how accounting has contributed to the large scale growth of societies, then why would your opinion on any of these topics be worth anything at all the supreme arrogance here is in your hubris that you should be listened to even when speaking from a megaphone of unqualified ignorance.

I am well aware of the impacts of evolution (and accounting, if it pleases you to place it on a pedestal for the purposes of this argument; it doesn't deserve to be there) but I continue to maintain that scientists and accountants can continue to do their jobs regardless of what our frequently referenced Walmart greeter in Arkansas thinks of their work. (And holy shit, nothing makes you sound more arrogant than accusing someone of ""supreme arrogance."" Just an FYI).

>When faced with an argument or debate on topics where you have no knowledge the sane, rational, productive, and I dare say even the polite thing to do is either hold your tongue or ask questions of experts and professionals to learn more about it.

So, you misconstrue what I say, deploy several straw men, presuppose that I don't believe in evolution, am too stupid to understand any of the topics we've discussed, and then suggest that because of my arrogance, I should know when to hold my tongue. (We can take on ad hominem attacks now I suppose. That may have been the most condescending and unnecessary paragraph both in your argument and in an entire thread of otherwise polite and civilized discourse.)

"> Wilson and Ed Brown aren't even ""ultra"" high-end at all, but if that's what OP thinks it is, then they're better off with Dan Wesson.

That's condescending. I'm familiar with Dan Wesson, and have handled multiple examples. I'm not as impressed with their fit and finish for $500 to $1,000 less -- and their actions tend to feel ""grittier"" to me than Wilson / Ed Brown.

"How about this:

>Finally, a fourth function of women in males’ patriarchal competition with each other is to reduce the stress of competition by serving as an UNDERCLASS. As Elizabeth Janeway has written in Between Myth and Morning, under patriarchy women represent the lowest status, a status to which men can fall only under the most exceptional circumstances, if at all. Competition among men is serious, but its intensity is mitigated by the fact that there is a lowest possible level to which men cannot fall. One reason men fear women’s liberation, writes Janeway, is that the liberation of women will take away this unique underclass status of women. Men will now risk falling lower than ever before, into a new underclass composed of the weak of both sexes. Thus, women’s liberation means that the stakes of patriarchal failure for men are higher than they have been before, and that it is even more important for men not to lose.

Elizabeth Janeway is AFAB. Maybe you can put your ego aside, stop twisting things into being about you, and listen to her? Your experiences do not represent every AFAB experience like you are clearly implying with comments like

>I’m telling you something different. Something that I, an AFAB person would know

"Speaking of objectivity you can't call the plot of Inquisition worse than the plot of either of the previous games. Speaking subjectively, I still wouldn't want to.

>Unlike subjects impaired by alcohol, individuals under the influence of cannabis tend to be aware of their impairment and try to compensate for it accordingly, either by driving more cautiously[26] or by expressing an unwillingness to drive altogether

Your own source literally show that cannabis impairs people to such a degree that they are forced to compensate, or not drive altogether. When driving, there are sudden situations where compensation is simply not an option, such as mergin on a highway, avoiding a wild animal, or rapidly breaking for any other reason. A person who has smoked drugs would undoubtedly perform worse here than someone in perfect condition. 

As for your study:

unsafe action was 1.39 (99% CI = 1.21-1.59) for drivers who tested positive for cannabis.

"> > If it's a good review of the game, that small band of people yell that it was paid for by EA.

> Shill reviews are a thing.

Just because shill reviews exist does not mean every positive review is a shill review. Nor does it logically justify treating every positive review as such.

If some As (positive reviews) are Bs (shill reviews), that doesn't mean all As are Bs. 

I could draw you a diagram if it would help you avoid making logically worthless points in the future, especially so as to avoid the embarrassment of being condescending about it while you do so. In this way, maybe you can avoid being condescending about your psuedo-logic just like you should avoid being condescending about writing style on an internet forum, since it's a bad look which only gets worse when your hypocrisy is highlighted.

If you have a point to make, try to make it without being condescending or snarky. And try to think it through carefully. You will come across better.

> > I have no idea why people who don't like the game any more feel compelled to waste their time in a sub about it.

> The people you see here complaining about the game do so because they love the game, are severely disappointed in how it has been handled, and feel betrayed by BWA. 

That all makes sense and I get it. Think those feelings are easy to understand and seem totally valid. Indeed, I think it sucks BWA basically switched out the game on people in many ways. (Even if it turns out to have been a good business decision, which is still unproven long-term, it still sucks on an empathetic level for players. Many good business decisions suck for consumers.)

Get the feelings. And I'm not talking about people advocating for change reasonably or providing constructive criticism or any other sensible, healthy act. I'm talking about denying facts because they don't align with a subjective perception, about throwing out unproven accusations (eg a particular positive review is a shill review) and treating it as fact, about insulting people that do like the game, about spamming complaints in threads that have nothing to do with the area of complaint, and the like. Re-read the list of example scenarios I provided, if you must, in order to understand the difference between what I'm talking about versus criticizing the way people feel or taking reasonable actions based on those feelings. 

Turning around your subsequent point... As adults, people are responsible for how they handle their feelings. I get ffeelingbetrayed by BW and upset about Swtor and it's current direction. That justifies rational discourse on perceived shortcomings and advocacy for change. Does not, however, justify acting like a tool and doing the things I highlighted (deny facts obstinately when they point to health/growth, dismiss positive opinions, talk down to or insult players who enjoy the game, spam complaints in irrelevant places, create low-effort, unconstructive complaint comments, etc). Hopefully you can process this logic.

> > When you yourself enjoy a game, it's annoying to see people yelling about it.

> If you can't take people criticizing the game you enjoy, that's on you. 

I can take it, clearly. One must, in order to participate here. That doesn't mean I like it. Nor does it mean I should view it as justified or rational or helpful behavior.

Again with the logic.

"> I don't get a tipsy feeling from one glass of wine. 

You may not feel it, but it's scientifically proven that even a small amount of alcohol impairs judgment, reflexes, and responsiveness.

Most people DO drink to at least achieve tipsiness, not for some kind of historical appreciation. XD I lived in Bavaria for a while. I know this is true of Germans as well as Americans.

>Nobody can tell me weed is ""100% harmless"", or that people use it very responsibly.

Nobody is saying that it is 100% harmless. But I think it is just clearly less harmful than alcohol and don't see how you can be okay with alcohol and totally against weed. It makes no sense. Alcohol destroys lives in a much more significant way than weed. And you want to talk brain damage? Long term heavy alcohol use can leave you basically catatonic. And nobody dies from a single night of smoking too much.

> admit my opinion is also because I'm a convert from a charasmatic Jamaican non-denominational church, where weed usage was high and the excuses for the drug were constant.

>But I do stand by my opinion which is backed by Scripture, the Apostles, the Church father's, and Church rules.

Listen dude, first of all this is an extremely dishonest thing to do, you don't misquote someone or try to imply they were saying things they weren't actually saying.

Secondly, as I've stated in many comments afterwards (and implied in the original post itself) I want to encourage people to do their own googling. As you literally said yourself ""Do your own research, find the answers for yourself. "" That is exactly what I said, and what I encourage people to do. 

I don't want to throw hand-picked studies at them to imply that the issue is black and white (which is precisely what you just did), because it isn't. Stuides often contradict themselves, I could very well find an article saying the exact opposite of every single article you linked. As I said in the very beginning, I listed off some points which seem to be the current consensus on the mater. I never at any point said that Cannabis is completely safe, I stated very clearly that people should do their own unbiased research, and praised Dan for being neutral on the issue. I couldn't possibly have been clearer. 

You are twisting my words in many ways. For instance when I say it isn't physically addictive in the same sense as heroin is, there is no debtae about this, it isn't. It can very well cause withdrawal symptoms, with varying intensity, I never denied that, but that is different from a physical addiction caused by your body needing the substance to function. 

>Being a medicine does not make something safe

I completely agree and have never implied it does, if your own definition of the word ""medicine"" means ""something completely safe"", then that is your issue, it's not a ""weasel word"", it's a word with a set definition that I used properly, and that states/countries where medical cannabis is legal, use to reffer to it. Stop with the semantics traps.

>Wrong, cannabis does make you paranoid:

I never said it doesn't! You can't simply bring up factors that I haven't mentionned (I would have needed to write a 500 pages book to say everything there is to say about cannabis) and just say ""Wrong"", as if I intentionally mislead people by leaving a single factor out or saying something actually wrong about it.

> You don't need Shiva Lingam to be with Shiva, hell Aghoris (most strict Shaiv sect) 'generally' don't worship Lingam, there are no shivlingam in cremation ground. Read yoga sutras of patanjali and learn the art of samadhi, sit in samadhi for hours and you'll find Shiva more closer to you than Shiva Lingam, and perhaps that's what Shvetashvatara Upanishad wants to tell.

This maybe true, see Aghoris, Rishies are on a different level of spirituality and they don't require the Lingam to be with Siva, they meditate for hours and through that they can reach him. Normal people who are not on their level need Lingam, as I said we feel and try to tap into Siva's consciousness through the lingam. Like it helps us to focus by weeding out the unwanted noise while meditating and worshiping him. I especially felt that during some jyotirlinga temples when I was allowed to sit and worship near the linga. 

> every religion has this problem

Yes, even Saivism has, but there are ways and means to reduce it in Saivism. It gives you the freedom to navigate through your own path learn through experiences. There is no force of Scriptures on you. You can be a pious Saivite as learned scholar or through bhakti or through karma yoga, etc.

"> ""Doing evil things"" means doing somethings which reduce overall well-being of others... that's as objective as one can be about morality. An ""evil person"" is a person who consciously tries to do ""evil things"" knowing they are evil.

These people are incredibly far and in-between, and only include sadists that acknowledge their affliction. Otherwise, by your category, a whole lot of evil people might be considered good. Most people do the things that they do with the belief that they are doing it for the ultimate good. Terrorists think they are fighting for a higher cause, whether religious or otherwise. National leaders start wars and send their own men to death believing that the greater payoff is worth it. Genocide organizers believe that they are cleansing the populace of genetically rotten human vermin, much like an exterminator fumigates an apartment without any remorse for the bed bugs. Even your seemingly correct statement about the nature of evil reveals itself to be faulty upon a cursory examination. Now consider that everyone has their own sense of right of wrong, just like you and I do, and any blanket statement regarding ""good"" or ""evil"" people immediately falls apart.

Case in point, to juxtapose your definition of evil vs the actions of the perpetrator in the article:

> ""Doing evil things"" means doing somethings which reduce overall well-being of others... that's as objective as one can be about morality. An ""evil person"" is a person who consciously tries to do ""evil things"" knowing they are evil. A ""good person"" can unintentionally do ""evil things"" through a misunderstanding of the consequences of their actions.

The cult leader believed he was consciously doing a good thing by ridding the world of the antichrist. Presumably, he leads the sect in order to guide his followers towards the truth and salvation. Thus, his act could be considered a misguided good deed unintentionally turned into an evil act. By your definition, he may still constitute a ""good person""."

I would prefer a game that has some sort of long-term value over $50 for a new game every week that I'll never play again. But this is just my opinion, just like how $50 a week being a good deal is your opinion.

>There are many, many people who buy new and DON'T resell, thus disproving your belief.

So then if I offered to sell you a good video game for hundreds of dollars, you would pay it without shopping around for a better deal? What if I offered you a terrible game at the same price as a good game? Would you take those deals?

">This isn't really up for debate. This is how it works. If you don't have an intuitive understanding of the math of this, I'm sorry I won't be able to spend any more of my time explaining it to you.

That's grossly condescending. There is no need for such smugness when the topic at hand is of such complexity. 

Firstly, You have missed the point that going by your logic, the rating in such an isolated pool should not stop at 2700 and go on to 9000 or 15000 or infinity, if indeed the rating is diverging. What you are saying implies that Elo rating system is a diverging formula, which it is not. Elo is a converging & not a diverging formula. Every separate pool of players will have it's own floor and ceiling rating. Not every pool will touch 2700. 

Secondly, An isolated pool of players is different from FIDE pool that plays international chess as such the rating distribution will be different from the distribution in which all (FIDE ) players play.

Thirdly, you have hardly backed it up with any mathematical proof, white paper etc.

>If a player consistently plays in a weaker pool of players that's generally isolated from another pool (it doesn't have to be completely isolated, let's say even if 80% of their games are with each other only), then the best players from the weaker pool may be overrated. Now I would never say this is true of the top women's players without hard evidence to back it up, but theoretically, they very well may be overrated if the pool of women's players play each other a high percentage of the time.

Going back to the top, I agree totally with this bit. However, my contention lies with the following bit: 

>Just imagine you start chess on an island of very mediocre players, and they all start at a provisional rating, and no one ever visits the island. Whoever the best player on the island is going to end up with a 2700+ rating, even if the best player on that island isn't even Grandmaster strength

Because, if the ratings keep diverging, they would not stop at 2700 but go to 5000-6000-infinite. And also with this bit: 

> For one it gives credence to the idea that there's some sort universally true rating that you can assign to each player, which there isn't.

There are many rating systems: Elo, Glicko, Chessmetrics etc. Now, each individual player might have different absolute values in different system i.e 2600 in elo, 9000 in glicko etc, But the relative position(rank) of a particular player among all the chess player in the world will be more or less the same, at a given point of time. If you compare the ""chess skill"" of [Carlsen Vs Hou hufan Vs a FM Vs a Club player] on any chess rating system, the relative position will be [Carlsen>Hufan> FM > club player]. 

In this contest, yes there is a notion of inherent chess skill. A club player will rank below Carlsen on any chess rating system, without major flaws. The most accepted and commonly used one is Elo rating system, there may be some flaws in it, but it does a fairly good job of quantifying the chess skill of players in an objective manner. 

I suggest, we start a separate thread regarding the issue of an isolated pool of players being gauged on Elo scale and the subsequent behavior of rating distribution.

"> I still expect A to apologize to B, because I want it to learn that it was wrong indeed and to acknowledge the fact that it accepted that it was wrong. In that sense, I view an apology maybe as a way to admit to a wrong, but not necessarily as an admission of malice.

But the thing is, you're equating my intellect to that of a learning child so you are being condescending. You are also in fact saying that I did something wrong and I should apologise for it, even though all I did was air my opinion on a topic that I was discussing.

If my opinion is that all Mexicans are racist then how can you say I'm doing something wrong by telling you that's my opinion? The opinion may be wrong but the sharing of it is not. It is in fact the sharing of it that allows you to debate it and change the person's mind. You are talking about instilling fear in someone airing their opinion like that, when it's actually beneficial to everyone if they do air their opinion so that the debate can get to the core of what's in the person's mind. Like we already established, you believe they are child-like in their thoughts and you are superior, therefore you condescendingly wish to teach them how to behave and in this case it's to shut off their opinion.

There was a time when I may have been killed for saying I don't believe in Jesus, you are coming from the perspective of being in the camp that supports that. You may not agree with being killed for it, but you, at the time, would have agreed that what I was saying is wrong and I should apologise, as according to popular belief, not believing in Jesus was absolutely unimaginable. Which is essentially the same mindset as the people who take the punishment further. Both of you don't like my opinion so you want me to be punished for it and both of you feel superior in intellect and knowledge so you believe you should have precedence over the situation.

Do you see my point here? The popular opinion now is that racism is bad, which is good (in my opinion). However, I don't feel superior in intellect and/or knowledge of others who decide to voice their opinion in a discussion. If they literally say ""all mexicans are rapists"", I'm not going to ask them to apologise. I'll be happy that they voiced their opinion openly, regardless of how idiotic it may sound to me. Now if I am involved in the discussion I can actually discuss a core part of what's going through their mind. The way you're talking about addressing it, you are shutting off any discussion of it, which is dangerous. Shutting off discussion of it is not going to lead to progress in that person's mind.

A controversial view I hold at the moment is that all drugs should be legalised and regulated.

yep, in the example.

>The fact that you went to the park was not decided by you.

No, that does not follow at all. Nothing dictated whether I go or not, but I had plenty of reasons for either.

>instead of being bugged with ... a small number of special cases (blonde Asian or Albino Asian), we need to prioritize the effort on grouping, resonating, uniting those who share the more commonality and experience with us. Two criteria for determining ""groupability"": 1) how similar are we living our lives? 2) how similar are we perceived by the society.

So you think Hmong people don't share any commonalities with Vietnamese and Chinese people? And that they somehow live different lives and are perceived as white by society?

These people aren't albinos - They have naturally light hair. It's all about celebrating our diversity. There's white Albinos, they are still white(r). I don't know what point you're trying to make.

>As long as they are: sharing the same cultural experience, and perceived by the society in the same way as us in the West. Then they are Golden people. No doubt.

What cultural experience?

Kyrgyz, Malay and Yakut culture have little in common with Sinospheric culture. How is a Muslim Indonesian from West Papua more similar to a Chinese than a Native American? Are you saying a Dayak or Toraja or Igorot or Lumad is more similar to you than they are to Amazonian natives?

>The concept of ""Mongoloid"" was created by European. In this frame work, EA/SEA/CA people are also grouped together with Polynesians, Melanesians and Native Americans. 

Mongoloid is not an artifical concept like Asia, created and dictated by white people, it's a phenotype. If an ethnic group displays Mongoloid features such as coarse hair of round crossection and fewer sweat glands, they are Mongoloid. That's why EA/SEA/CA are grouped together with Polynesians and Native Americans. An Austronesian from Taiwan or the Philippines has more in common with a Polynesian or Micronesian than with a continental Austro-Asiatic speaker or a Tai speaker or a North East Asian Sino-Tibetan speaker. Mongoloid peoples belong to various language families and various cultures. A Buryat is not intrinsically closer to an East Asian than a Native American, by language or culture. 

> They already have their own movement to be busy with. As long as any of them are interested in culture and languages in EA/SEA, and want to participate in our movement, they are very welcome to join our cause.

Movements are supposed to come together to form a stronger united front, something Asians in diaspora are seemingly incapable of doing. There are Native Americans guys like u/Shoelacepepper and u/navajosupreme who are pro-Asian, support a Pan-Mongoloid worldview and are aware of how important racial solidarity is. East Asia is not somehow the center of the Mongoloid movement, although it's where wealth and power is most highly concentrated. I'm not sure why you group East Asia with South East Asia, they are completely different entities, just like how Mesoamerica and Andean Native America are completely different entities, apart from the Chinese diaspora in SEA and Peru who occupy similar societal niches. What do you think we could gain by associating with Native Americans and Polynesians? Think about it hard.

What is 'our cause'? Spell it out for me. And why would they join this vague concept of 'our cause'? Their cause is to reclaim their land, their culture and identity, their right to self determination of their people's future They view the world through a Pan-Mongoloid lens and feel kinship with us. But somehow you manage to turn it into some ethnocentric 'they gotta learn our language and culture(which one exactly?) to be participating in our cause' elitism. 

>In this frame work, EA/SEA/CA people are also grouped together with Polynesians, Melanesians and Native Americans. 

Not Melanesians, Melanesians are Australoid. 'Polynesian-Melanesian kids' means they are mixed, of partial Polynesian and Melanesian descent, meaning half Mongoloid half Australoid. And some Melanesians speak Papuan languages. 

>They are ""Mongoloid"", no bash. My question is:are they really effective allies to be grouped with?

They are Australoids with Denisovan DNA, not Mongoloid.

> small number of special cases (blonde Asian or Albino Asian)

There's plenty of blonde Mongoloids who aren't Albino. They just didn't become the majority, for various historical reasons starting with the Neolithic. Calling them special cases is tantamount to insult, it's completely disrespectful. Reflect on that.

>we need to prioritize the effort on grouping, resonating, uniting those who share the more commonality and experience with us.

With your attitude you aren't going to make any allies. A Malay guy would have spat in your face if you'd come at him with that condescending attitude.

">Start with the assumption that alien-based UFOs can't get to Earth from other star systems.

No one is doing this. It's just a last-ditch consideration for when the more probable explanations have been exhausted. It's exactly why the Dyson megastructure hypothesis is on the table for that star that was studied last year, but very low on the list. Scientists are willing to consider that there really is a megastructure surrounding it, and if there's a way to test that hypothesis, they will (and have), but they're aware that it's extremely unlikely, and that a more mundane explanation is most likely, per what I stated in my previous post. The difference with these videos is that there is no way to test anything, so the ""aliens"" hypothesis has to sit on the back burner until better evidence arrives, or a way to test something presents itself, if it ever does. But right now, we just have a blurry video and some eyewitness testimony, the latter of which is not considered scientific evidence.

Again, no one in the skeptic community is actively stating that aliens could never get here. They're just waiting for actual evidence that aliens have already visited before more seriously considering videos like this.

>Sprinkle on a little of ""if aliens could get here, it would be so rare as to be a probability of basically zero. [Insert meaningless Drake Equation calculation based on more assumptions.]”

Nope. No calculations necessary. There is a difference between playing with numbers to guess at the probability of alien life (and acknowledging that there almost definitely are aliens, even if they're just microbes), and simply realizing that aliens being here on earth is something for which we have no evidence. It would be the first time that such a scenario had been observed, which automatically, due to the nature of probability, makes it less likely in the face of ""ordinary"" evidence than other possibilities that have been observed thousands of times over. Sticking with the Bayes Theorem, the ""prior knowledge"" of this event is simply that previous events have never returned hard evidence of aliens, which greatly diminishes the chances of such evidence emerging to support this event.

If someone flipping a quarter claims that, while you were in another room, instead of getting heads or tails, one of the sides temporarily turned up as the face of Donald Trump, you'd have to consider extremely unlikely explanations, like the Mandela Effect, or some kind of inter-dimensional event, right alongside other explanations, like hallucination or misidentification, because Trump's face on a quarter would be a new, never seen before outcome of the event, where we're used to there only being two potential outcomes. It's extraordinary. It requires better evidence than a blurry video of a quarter where, with weird lighting, Washington's face sort of resembles Trump's. And it definitely requires more than your friend stating that he ""saw what he saw,"" even if he's more qualified at quarter-flipping than the average person due to considerable more experience with flipping coins (maybe he's a magician or something and uses quarters in his acts all the time).

You are aware, on a subconscious level, that this is true, and you probably spend the vast majority of your time in situations like this exercising this way of thinking without even realizing it. But when something cool, fascinating, or larger than everyday life presents itself, the desire to believe is so strong that it presents a bias that makes you want to give in to things like appeal to authority in order to support your confirmation bias. Why make exceptions to rational thinking just because it feels good?

>3) Now that they've improperly set the rules, the ""skeptics"" over there can (as you're trying to do here with Bayes' Theorem) eliminate the strangest elements of any strong UFO case by simply appealing to probability

Nope. No one is eliminating anything. Aliens are still on the table. But no one is going to more seriously consider it until we're completely out of ordinary explanations, which we aren't. We need more video, more recreations of the FLIR scenario, and more time to think about how it could be a plane, drone, etc. Once all of that has been run through and nothing sticks, then we move on to aliens. Throwing away the possibility of aliens would be dishonest, but no skeptic is actually stating ""It is literally impossible for this video to be depicting aliens."" That would be silly and ignorant.

>""overall it's much more likely that the object was an aircraft, and we've found some hugely improbable yet mundane event that could almost semi-plausibly explain that element of this UFO case. And therefore (because UFOs are improbable, remember?), all this other evidence can be dismissed, too.

This is where you lose grasp of what's happening, here. You're poo-pooing the idea that it's a misidentified aircraft, even though Mick West has good reason to consider that possibility, and even though you yourself realize that it's still a valid possibility, and then you start talking about ""all this other evidence."" What evidence? With respect to this specific situation, there is none. With respect to previous UFO encounters, there is nothing substantial at all, and certainly nothing that would hold up in court. All we're talking about here is a FLIR video. That's it. If you're aware of other videos from the same event, or some physical evidence like the alleged ""recovered materials"" that Bigelow claims to have that we can actually look at, please provide it.

>4) And now we get to the part some self-labeled skeptics love the most: sit and wait, while impatiently drumming their fingers, for the UFOlogists -- UFOlogists who are almost entirely part-time and amateurish, necessarily -- to provide the skeptics with the ""extraordinary evidence"" that would be needed in order to prove that true UFOs are real.

Why sit and wait? We have some possible explanations that are pretty likely, but since it's just a blurry video, we can never know what's shown for sure. Once we put forth explanations in order of probability, that's really all that we can do. We're done. Nothing has been proved or disproved definitively -- we're just placing our bets on aircraft or drones. With some videos, like the Chilean incident, we can go a bit further, but this video is too unclear for us to do that, so we put forth an explanation and leave it at that. No one is waiting for ufologists to do anything, because placing that burden on anyone for a simple video like this would make no sense.

Speaking of ufologists, your insistence that they would be the ones to provide counter-evidence to skeptics is troubling, as though this is some kind of war between two groups, each biased in the opposite direction. Why not simply say that skeptics are waiting for anyone to provide the evidence instead of ""ufologists""? I don't understand the need to belong to a team and ""win"" this. Skeptics are not about ""winning"" and being on a team, they're about the truth.

>First of all, why are amateurs and not scientists doing the ""proving"" here?

Because that's not what scientists do for a living. Skeptics have taken it upon themselves, often in their own free time, to debunk things or at least put forward plausible explanations, because it's important to promote proper critical thinking skills over emotional responses to situations in life in general. Scientists do experiments. Is there an experiment that can be done with a DoD FLIR video? If so, what is it?

>Can anyone think of any other topics where scientists have done basically nothing even after literally hundreds of thousands of observations, with thousands of them buttressed by possibly-compelling physical evidence? (Maybe compelling, maybe not... but we'll never know without experts... also known as ""scientists."")

Again, it's not the business of scientists to look at videos and make definitive statements regarding what they're showing. Scientists do experiments. Using the Large Hadron Collider to collide particles and playing a video while drawing lines on it for YouTube are very different things, and the latter is not science.

The ""hundreds of thousands of observations"" to which you refer are anecdotal or inconclusive. And again, what physical evidence? There is none. No one has ever come forward with a chunk of alien spacecraft. Even if they don't wind up on 60 Minutes, they could still provide it to a YouTuber and go viral, but it's never happened.

The fact that you put the word ""scientists"" into quotes seems condescending and unnecessary, as though you believe that it's their job to even be talking about this in the first place, which it isn't. There is a difference between waiting for something to test as a scientist while literally never being presented such a thing, and actively dismissing a chunk of aircraft because it's ""taboo"" to test it. If the latter were to happen, someone, somewhere would still get a hold of the material and do something with it -- even if it were a reporter, Internet personality, or other amateur.

You also have to remember that the ""scientific community"" is not monolithic. It exists across the globe, and ""members"" of this community are in constant disagreement with one another.

This statement shows that you don't understand the difference between high level languages and machine languages. The high level languages still need an interpreter, using Haskell or ADGA still requires interpretation to the machine. That interpretation is still a cultural one. You must show me the Turing level proof. Oh wait, there is one, Turing did it. This is how I am trying to contextualize our discussion. But you keep saying proofs like the downthread link from u/univalence is somehow not interpreted to a machine level. But in fact it is. This is misleading and also a logical fallacy. Machine interpreted languages are not powerful enough to make the kinds of descriptions you ask for. While there are Turing emulators which are, these are cumbersome and is something maybe I will get to next year after my other plates clean off. The fact that you can assume I have 3 days of free time and that's all it will take me to learn a new computer language is extremely presumptuous of you. I'm a polyglot, but it takes me at least 3 weeks to learn new syntax and another 3-6 weeks to learn a new framework and library and another month or two to build a good API. This is what you are asking me to do with my 3 days of free time. You might be a lot faster than I am at this, I have only been coding since I was 27. I am much better at playing the piano than you are. So what? It might take me a couple days to do what takes you a year. I'm confident eventually you will be able to learn the piano, but you will never learn a new song as fast as me. This is what you sound like to me.

>What does this mean? 

This is a combination of the concept of a superstructure over N and the application of impredicative logic when applied to the superstructure and how such impredicative logic, when one accounts for my proofs, becomes substructures to the superstructure SN itself, rather than universal statements. Current mathematics assumes universal statements, because no one has found otherwise. I found otherwise.

> Nothing is barring you from learning mathematics, except an investment of time and effort.

Now you're actually being condescending. But... I guess you're not, in your own head. I'm so offended. But I guess I'm not, in my own head.

>What does this mean?

Are you asking to figure out if I know what [SN]( http  is, or are you asking because you honestly don't know? It's another word for ""Universe"" in mathematics. It's kind of like meta-Natural numbers. It's related to concepts from von Neumann when he was developing his von Neumann hierarchy. The order of the natural numbers and so forth, such that the union of SN is a class V of sets of type N, where N is countable. and so forth. Stuff like that. Sorry for not being technical in this very non-technical forum. I guess I should have said, ""subclass"" to be more technical. But class and set are essentially, different nomenclatures for the same concept, so that we can avoid problems like impredicative definitions. I certainly agree with Von Neumann on this.

>Almost everything I have learned is in principle freely available on sites like Wikipedia, and anything else I have learned I could have asked on math.stackexchange.com and gotten an answer on. Nothing is barring you from learning mathematics, except an investment of time and effort.

Great. And I do this AND audit classes, seminars, conferences and forums at MIT and Harvard in person. I'll let everyone know at next years current developments that I don't understand what the difference between a class and a seminar is. We just the forum of X, and multiply by a semester, then credit the class with some cash. I really have no idea how to understand mathematics in a semantically divergent universe; where logic equals culture and bad equals good. At least, that is how you sound to me.

>I read what you are now calling ""#1"", as that is what you linked in the comment I responded to. I looked up rho (at least, if that what is called rho` in ""#1""?), and although the definition is not clear to me, it seems that you have not proved that rho and rho have the same cardinality, and so again, the proof does not go through.

and

>You use it in step one of your proof, though. Step 1 of your proof is, paraphrased, ""we leave it as an exercise to the reader to show that rho surjects onto the 2-adics using the fact that it contains all infinite binary strings"". Hence your proof is invalid.

I know it's confusing that I'm asking you to combine two papers here. But it's obvious that you are combining them incorrectly. Just ignore paper #1, and forget about cardinality. And focus on diagonalization from paper 2. From there, you will understand it well enough to apply what I'm asking, to the bijection you so desperately are tying to understand. I might take some extra time to rewrite paper 1, in light of this mess. But not for at least 6 months. I have that one way function to write and get executing first!

You do not own your insults. They cannot be stolen, and if the person who claims to have been polite is offended by his own words, then all the better.

There is no implication that she wanted to escape alone. There is more of an implication that she would escape with whatever means. The declaration does not mean she has a plan. It means she wants to escape, she doesn't necessarily know how.

"> I understand your confusion, it took me a while too. But contraception leads to abortion, so it cannot be allowed. If you don't believe me, open your eyes.

First off, this is really condescending, and not appreciated. But on to the actual argument.

I don't really understand how your second point should apply to married couples using it to plan a family. It seems like you're saying that anything the Church allows in the context of marriage, it would have to allow outside it too. But clearly that's not the case.

If contraception is not 100% effective, then how is using it closing yourself to the possibility of life? The disconnect between these arguments has always troubled me."

">You claim that it is faulty without anything to back it up. Rights are cultural institutions, like marriages and money.

The analogy is faulty because marriages and money are man-made institutions that can only exist due to one or more preexisting rights or related ""moral facts"". Your analogy conflates an institution's required antecedent with the institution itself. In other words, rights are not like currency or marriage, but are instead the necessary predecessors to currency and marriage.

>This question is nonsensical. Rights aren't theorems. They aren't proved. They are declared, recognized, granted, asserted, etc.

You already accepted the phraseology in your prior response, in which you stated that rights were proved by being asserted in the proper context. 

>No, I asserted that, applying the standards you set (i.e., ""we can make anything a right""), we would logically deduce that nothing is a right.

>>Please actually do logically deduce it, and I'll concede the point. Until then it's empty rhetoric to say that you could do it. I'll repeat myself: no matter how much you need to misread me, I don't endorse moral relativism.

In asserting that something is a right, we are making one or more moral propositions. Through the lens of moral realism, whether or not the asserted right actually exists will depend on whether or not its moral propositions are objectively true. For example, in asserting a human right to liberty, we make the moral proposition that slavery is immoral. If slavery is moral, it cannot be that there is a human right to liberty. You have argued that we can make anything a right. This means that the existence of a right cannot depend on the objective veracity of any underlying moral proposition. If we can make anything a right, no moral proposition is objectively true or false; instead, moral propositions are true if (as you argued) the operative inter-subjective agreement deems such propositions true. If no moral proposition is objectively true, than no right objectively exists. Thus, if we can make anything a right, nothing is objectively a right.

Now, you might sustain an argument that we can make anything a right and that rights are subjective. However, that obliterates the distinction between rights, on the one hand, and laws or rules, on the other and is, ultimately, nihilistic.

And, again, I'm not misreading you. You asserted that we can make anything a right. That statement is a statement of moral relativism. If you'd like to retract that statement, I invite you to do so. If you think that you can prove that moral realism or moral universalism permits your statement, I invite you to do so. Failing these actions, I must conclude that you are a moral relativist.

>No, for the same reason that married people and currency exist objectively.

Do you believe that moral propositions are objectively true or do you believe that moral propositions are true to the extent they reflect an operative inter-subjective agreement? The former is the view of moral realists. The latter is the view of moral relativists. The value of currency and the meaning of marriage can only be analogized to rights if you adopt the latter view of rights. In which case, you are declaring yourself a moral relativist (again).

>A consequentialist, say an utilitarian, could, to make it simple, just say that the only moral fact is that one should maximize utility, while still holding that rights (like currency and marriages) are human institutions, albeit ones that tend to maximize utility in most (but not all) circumstances.

What do you think you demonstrated here? Answer this: if a utilitarian consequentialist said that the only moral fact is that one should maximize utility could he also maintain that we can make anything a right? Could such a person, for example, accept that a right to inefficiency exists?

>Sure, but natural rights theory is far from being entailed by moral realism, which I fucking endorse.

Your rejection of natural rights theory was premised on your claim that ""we can make anything a right."" This is inherently a rejection of natural rights theory and moral realism. If you'd like to reject natural rights theory on some other grounds, feel free to do so.

>Anyway I reject the premise which states that approval and disapproval, which are learned social practices, are biologically determined.

Do you therefore reject that there is a biological basis for any human attitude toward any behavior?

>But far from being self-evident, the idea that normativity reduces to biology is highly contested.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""reduces"" to biology. To the extent you're referring to a notion that culture has absolutely no influence on normativity, I never made such an assertion and would say that this claim is not only highly contested, but generally rejected. If, however, you're referring to the notion that biology has at least some influence on normativity, I would say that such a proposition is not highly contested, and is widely accepted. In any event, you had claimed (using more vulgar rhetoric) that I completely made up the notion that there was biological basis for moral judgments. Now, in stating that this concept is ""highly contested,"" you've conceded that I did not fabricate the argument.

>Cool. 'All cultures agree that X is wrong, therefore X is wrong as a matter of fact' is a non-sequitur. Ad populum.

I did not assert that the commonality of moral impulses across disparate cultures was evidence that such impulses were ""correct"". Rather, I asserted that the commonality of moral impulses across disparate cultures was evidence that such impulses had biological bases. Another straw man from the boy who cried straw man.

>Is correlation causation now? What about immoral behavior of people with healthy brains?

You're confusing necessary and sufficient conditions again. Clearly, brain pathology can cause immoral behavior and diminish a person's ability to perceive the immorality of his behavior. This indicates that our moral predispositions have a material basis--e.g., that our brain structures affect our moral impulses. Nothing about this relationship between certain brain pathologies and immoral behaviors excludes the possibility that people with structurally typical brains will act immorally. The argument is that brain pathology can be a sufficient condition for immoral behavior, not that brain pathology is a necessary condition for immoral behavior.

>Genetic doesn't mean 'bio-chemical and heritable', it means 'pertaining to genes'. Stop moving the goalposts to wiggle out of your bullshit claims.

What do you think genes are? Do you see your pattern here? Every time the conversation moves beyond your evident ability to grasp, you try to explain away your own ineptitude by reverting to the discourse of a more comfortable field (philosophy), in order to assert that some logical fallacy or impermissible mode of argument has occurred. Describing an attribute as ""bio-chemical and heritable"" is not ""moving the goalposts"" from describing such an attribute as genetic.

>Did you cum yet? Again: philosophy grad student, top of class, full scholarship. All I read here is empty rhetoric, pure bullshit and projection. I master the underlying issues and have to break them down for your dumb ass.

Your credentials are meaningless if the product of those credentials is deficient. At best you've exhibited some pedantic knowledge of certain ""terms of art,"" with limited mastery of the concepts those terms comprise and an extremely poor ability to understand, formulate or present logical arguments. Moreover, nothing about your writing, especially your propensity to devolve into vulgarity and churlishness when challenged, suggests any rigorous academic training or confidence with the subject matter. And I've not forgotten that this conversation began with you misstating the century in which the bulk of natural rights theory was developed (ironically in the context of a condescending comment attempting to mock me for presenting a natural rights thesis).

Further, your description of your credentials makes them suspect. Are you in a grad program that ranks its students? One that is graded on a curve? What does ""top of class"" mean in this context? Grade inflation in graduate programs, especially in the humanities, is rampant. My undergrad had one of the best Phil grad programs in the world. It was my understanding that anything below an A in that program was tantamount to failing and that this was the norm across comparable schools and disciplines. That's assuming you're even in a PhD program, which is questionable given your ""full scholarship"", as PhD programs waive students' tuition in exchange for undergraduate teaching/TA work. And, even if your credentials are accurate, I have no way of verifying whether you're in top-ranked graduate program, or if you're attending some lesser-tier institution. From your ""work product"" in our conversations, however, I'd bet the latter.

Also, if we're listing credentials, I'm an attorney. I went to one of the best law schools in the country, on a full a scholarship. I studied for several months under John Mikhail, who has written extensively on the topics we've discussed and whose work Noam Chomsky has advised. I also studied constitutional law, including the philosophical bases for modern notions of fundamental rights, under several of the leading jurists in the country. And I've discussed the moral and philosophical underpinnings for the Prop-8 litigation with Ted Olson and his legal team, so I have seen first hand how these arguments are grounded and litigated at the highest levels in this country. Thus, while I wouldn't claim mastery of philosophy at an academic level, I certain know enough to recognize someone with real ability and knowledge in the field--I think you can guess my estimation of you in this regard."

It wasn't just the despicable and pathetic insinuations that remainers are just of a bit better stock than their uneducated and closeted racist little Englander counterparts, but also their complete reluctance to engage with any of the legitimate arguments that have been around for over 40 years of Euroscepticism in Britain. This gave the impression that they didn't really have much to say about anything related to:

 the link between border control and national sovereignty 
 the link between the EU and the slow and steady erosion of almost a millennium of independent English law-making
 the reality that the EU is never going to be content being a free trade area with a common currency: it will move towards further and further political integration that would entail a large amount of domestic British institutions being either defunct or subordinate to a larger EU authority. 
 The concern that on many issues, the British people have to put up with an extra layer of red tape in the form of institutions representing over 500 million people who have very little interest in UK specific concerns. 

None of these were properly addressed by remain, because they know they would have tough times answering them. The EU does entail restrictions on the ability of a people to determine their own future. I often wondered over here how could the remain side be putting up so many condescending and alarmist arguments with a straight face, but from what I gather from people like you, there are no end of people in the UK and abroad who genuinely believe in their own superiority based on selective soundbites from a loud and stupid campaign from both sides.

This is simply what happens when a player has put forth the time and effort to become exceptionally skilled in his craft. This shouldn't be hard countered by something which requires exponentially less skill, IE active radar. Pilots are not entitled to big kill games, ground dwellers are not entitled to easy counters to things they just don't take the time to develop the skill for.

>Even if you go 30-5 in a match in BF4, which is still very possible, is that not good enough? That's 25 net kills that have to come from somewhere, and that somewhere is other players. Hell, that's a pretty great match for infantry. You're still going to be topping the scoreboard.

There is no such thing as ""good enough"". This whole thought train you are going down that is players should only be able to throw up a certain KD ratio is what I'm starting to call gaming socialism. ""It's for the good of everyone!!"" that 1 player shouldn't be able to use his long time developed skill. You can't even begin to compare the KD of a jet pilot to the KD of an infantryman, because the jet pilot SHOULD completely blow the stats of the infantryman out of the water. When something requires more skill, the rewards SHOULD be greater.

Day 1 infantryman: can get a few kills, take some objective points simple WASD running around yadda yadda i learned how to do that playing goldeneye 64.

Day 1 jet pilot: hey I am getting constantly shot down by the more experienced pilots on the other team and I can't hit anything on the ground at all and when I try I typically crash.

>Battlefield isn't supposed to be a helicopter domination simulator. It has been in the past. We understand that would be fun for you, but it also makes other parts of the game much less fun for many people, just so pilots can have their fun. And other players paid the same for the game as you, and deserve to have just as much fun doing what they like in the game.

No it isn't, but attack choppers are powerful IRL, and when you put the situation in perspective, IE you can have two chopper pilots on coms communicating things, they should pretty much dominate any 3 infantryman, taking into account there are two pilots plus the vehicle itself. This whole paragraph is really condescending tbh. You've completely missed the fact that pilots have put forth the time and effort into developing skill a typical infantryman has NOT, and that pilots deserve to be rewarded accordingly.

> like I still witness pilots do on a fairly regular basis.

Again with these generalizations, they are false and stupid, stop doing it.

>So please. Pilots of /r/battlefield_4 ... we hear your frustrations. We know what you want. You can still have a positive k/d in helos. Dice isn't likely to make all of the changes you are requesting (yes, I know your post was specifically about below radar, but I'm hijacking it because I'm sick of the repetitive posts).

>Can we tone down the broken record a bit?

How is a repetitive complaint about a repetitive post any less of an evil. We actually have a reason to be making the posts as we are asking for change, and all you are doing is complaining about us asking for change. You realize if we all stopped Dice would think everything is fine and no change would happen, right? So, no, we will continue, and you can just downvote the post and move on. The only broken record is when people like you come on here and bitch about skilled pilots having great games because they had nobody to counter them. Fuck that guy for having skill, right? He should be punished.

As far as your edit goes, you are spot on about baby steps with balance changes. However the game has been out for how many months now? When everyone is still asking for the same changes 6 months out of release, its time to kick it in the ass and make those fucking changes.

"> Ad-hominem: Attacking the person instead of their case.

Wrong. Ad-hominem is not 'insulting instead of arguing'. That is just insulting in general. Ad-hominem is a LOGICAL FALLACY in which A attacks B's argument on the grounds of B himself. In other words

""Your points are bad because you are an idiot"" - That is Ad-hominem, that is what I wasnt doing

""You are an idiot because your points are bad"" - That is not Ad-hominem, and that is what I was doing.

(as you will see later on [#], I called you stupid, stubborn and narrow mindedly shallow BECAUSE your points/abilty to argue was bad, I didnt call your points bad because I believed you were stupid, stubborn and narrow mindedly shallow, which if I did would have been Ad-hominem)

Get your logic right. Thats why they are called logical fallacies, not some argument rule you can understand by reading Wikipedia.

∴ 1) You do not understand the logical basis in which fallacies are derived from, neither do you understand the point of fallacies


> I also like how you compare me to a fundie Christian, which Reddit is known for being against, instead of using your time to back up your own lack of points or rebuttals.

Not only have you ignored my argument of your opinion of school days. You attacked a small metaphor I used to illustrate my argument. a FUCKING METAPHOR. And then you generalized it to some Reddit opinion. One: Who gives a shit. Two: that's irrelevant anyway (would you rather me say your like an atheist who refuses the possibiliy of there being a God. it still works the same way dumbass). So you literally misunderstood my point by focusing on the metaphor... when the metaphor was just a minor illustrate as the OVERALL POINT ITSELF!! On another note, what happened to you defending yourself anyway? Do you agree that you were being narrow minded by believing negative elements in writing are alway because of bad design decisions? What happened to your response of that? 

∴ 2) Not correctly responding to points given, not understanding the point, bypassing the reasoning, attacking a minor inference of a premise (the metaphor...really?) and not the actual argument


> How about this: Shorten your comments so they are easily digestible. It's hard to believe that people don't want to read everything that comes out of your amazing brain but it's true.

Sorry, how does length have anything to do with comprehensibility? Is the longer an argument, the worse it is? Have you even read a fucking proper argument? Tooley on abortion? Singer on Refugees? Kant on the Categorical Imperative? (seriously, go read fucking Kant and then come and tell me arguments need to be short and digestible to be good...no joke, actually go read fucking Kant and you'll see).

∴ 3) Irrelevant linguistic concerns


> Nice Strawman, btw: ""I was responding to the words you fucking wrote, how eles do you argue? read their minds instead?""
How about respond to the motion rather than thhe word choice?

Strawman is about fucking misrepresenting an argument in a bad light, and then to attack it. Like a Vegetarian saying ""Meat eaters are promoting killing animals, look how sadistic there are"" when in fact the meat eaters are actually giving a persuasive reasoned argument about how killing animals in a mere means to their ends of eating meat, and the killing can be humane.

∴ 1) [above]

Strawmaning has nothing to do with motion or word choice. I did not misrepresent your argument. In fact, I took the words you used as clear as day because that's what composed of your argument. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORDS YOU USE, DEFINITIONS ARE CRUCIAL IN ARGUMENTS, which is why we have fallicies such as equivocation.

∴ 4) You do not understand the importance of definitions and word choice in arguments


And for your info, attacking the motion of an argument is a VERY BAD IDEA. It leads to miscommunication, misunderstandings, assumptions and jumping to conclusions. Arguments are expected to be very very well written and precise (yea, you wont find such arguments on internet forums, go get a philosophy journal and look up Nagel or Epicurean). How? With fucking words. You must use the power of words carefully, and the best arguers can use them at the right place and right time, logically and consistently, in order to create a motion. But the argument is not lead by the motion, the argument is lead by the words, the motion is the result of the word choice!


∴ 5) Undervaluing the use of words in arguments, and not understanding the consequences that arise when one argues on motions; such as assumptions, jumping to conclusions, misunderstands. Which all arise because motions can be vague, so it is the WORD CHOICE that makes them clear.


> You didn't justify yourself, you only stated that you were right and moved on.

What was the point I was trying to justify? Oh yea, it was: You do understand how to argue. If you didnt understand how I was justifying it, let me make it clear in this post: 

1), 2), 3), 4), 5)

All the above points, which I have backed with reason, based on your sole reply, Give me strong reason to believe you do not understand the fundamental logical reasoning behind arguing, and that you do not know how to think critically i.e. argue


> Please do, that's the fucking point of a debate.

This is my problem here. Why would I even think of arguing with someone who cant argue (see the above sentence).

No Thank you very much. I believe we wont get anywhere, as we aren't getting anywhere anyway.

My insults are no Ad-hominem [#]. I see your narrow minded attitude towards school days, and reason that they are bad (see above post, which you never argued back and instead misunderstood everything: see 2) ), I see how you argue and attempt to think critically, and have reasoned why they are bad (seen in this post). Because you persistently comeback and attempt to justify yourself with misguided reason (as this post has shown), I believe you are acting stupidly, and because you refuse to admit your failings, in both your opinion and arguments, I believe you are acting stubbornly (seen in your replies).

""you are contempt with being stubborn, stupid and narrow mindedly shallow""

These are insults, based on reason, directed at you, NOT to call your reasoning itself bad (that would be Ad-hominem), but merely as an afterthought for the terrible terrible reasoning you provided.

Once you demonstrate you dont know how to think critically, its all over, The cats out of the bag, you've lost the ability to persuade and no one will bother to listen to you. You've literally given reason to everyone else that you cannot reason. 

That is why I wont even think of having a proper debate with you.

"> Evolution works through errors, so error-prone means fast.

> Conservation of energy. Where does the energy go? Condensing water releases heat, and the only method of releasing that heat is radiation, i.e. Earth will be the second-hottest object in our solar system.
The earth would cool rather quickly under the right circumstances - say, the aftermath of a large asteroid strike.

Now, I'm not an expert in plate tectonics (I'm barely an interested amateur), but while I've heard defences of these claims, I've yet to hear a serious rebuttal directed to someone knowledgeable enough to be able to respond. That may be because I haven't looked hard enough, but my understanding is that the models work, at least to a reasonable extent.

> Ah, the No True Scotsman. Who are these ""scholars worth their salt"" then? Are any of them secular?

Yes, many of them are secular. By that I meant ""Essentially all scholars who are qualified to speak on the subject, with the exception of Muslim scholars who deny the death of Jesus because Muhammad said He didn't die"". A quick search gave me this, which, while from an obviously Christian source, cites a number of atheists. Not a No True Scotsman - I apologize for being unclear in what I meant.

> In the end, you will have to resort to magic. The Judeo-Islamo-Christian creation myth is scientifically indefensible, and hiding it behind a veneer of science would only give you more problems.

What do you mean by this? Obviously, if God created the world ex nihilo then He didn't use science to do it. Christians merely claim that since then, the world has operated on the laws of nature that God set down - except for the times when God specifically intervened, the most important of which are written down in the Bible."

">but nazis and alt-right twats literally think that all nonwhites are vermin and given the option would kill them.

That's the thing. Antifa think that all 'nazis' (and their definition of Nazi is very, very broad) are vermin and, as you can see, very much would want to kill them if they could. The only reason they're sticking to just attacking them is that murder is much more incriminating than just punches. 

>Come back when antifa people are getting people elected into office and throwing spammers in the works of an actual equitable and benevolent society. Some of them are basically dumb criminals but they're not different from any other dumb criminal, whereas nazis and right-wing extremists are organized and actively seeking (in some places all too successfully) to undermine social process.

Uhh, what? If I understand you correctly, you're saying that right-wing extremists are organised rioters planning to disrupt society? Antifa are the exact same. They go out and hunt 'Nazis', and disrupt any event they feel is too 'Nazi'. Isn't this exactly what you're saying about right-wing extremists?

Also, you have dehumanised right-wing extremists into too simple 'villain' archetypes. They're not one coordinated group. They're not a huge organisation that aims to take over the world. They're different factions with different vile versions of an ideal world, so I would hardly call that organised. Antifa, similarly, is also quite spur of the moment. Antifa is not one united front, just like how 'Nazis' are not one united front.

If you think we couldn't do better in 2018, I think you should take your own advice.

>They were geniuses, they thought of every detail and designed it accordingly.

Lol. No, they didn't. 

They couldn't have possibly foreseen the level of technological innovation that would follow in the next two centuries when drafting things like the second amendment.

The majority voting system of the legislative branch detailed in the articles of the Constitution has HUGE problems; even back in my high school gov. class students were realizing how badly it could be abused by just reading the text itself. Literal children saw the flaws in the work of the said geniuses you claim thought of every detail.

>It truly is amazing what they accomplished, and America’s success historically proves that.
>Slavery only remained because they knew a lot of people would be upset and leave the union if it was taken out.

Please tell me you can see the irony in the juxtaposition of these two quotes? Saying America's success hinged on the Constitution is akin to saying Bill Gates' success is due to his skill as a programmer. The US built its empire on the backs of its own inhabitants from stealing land, purchasing land someone else stole, the slavery you just brushed under the rug, and even profiting off the fact that we were located across the Atlantic Ocean and could achieve our status as the world's leading superpower while our rival nations in Europe were all forced to deal with the consequences of both World Wars taking place in their backyards. Yes, US ingenuity and culture obviously played pivotal roles but you sound like a more eloquent version of the ""'Murica"" satire. Your comment almost reads like propaganda.

You don't seriously believe they allowed slavery because the states were twisting their arms right? The Constitution was set in place by people in power and implemented how they saw fit. The government was ran like an old boys club. You should read some historical accounts of how their sessions used to operate. What the founding fathers penned is indeed an impressive document and I'd argue that if it were executed to its letter and not by special interests seeking to exploit its loopholes, our country would be a lot better off. However, that's not reality and I'd be hard pressed to imagine that a group of intellectually honest experts in modern-day society couldn't put their heads together and make a document that doesn't have those loopholes and gaps in the first place. Of course, the Constitution was designed to be amended, however, the hurdles to achieving these amendments cannot be understated. The last one we had was before I was born in 1992 and only touched a minor detail, before that it was in 1971. If the Constitution is a ""living, breathing document"" it's got the vitals of an 110 year old tortoise.

First past the post voting is busted. See CGPGrey video series on the subject. Only idealists think that the two party system that it gave birth to could be healthy. The electoral college allowed both Bush and Trump to become presidents. You can read in ""Profiles in Courage"" how Kennedy truly believed that two or three large parties, rather than numerous smaller parties, would be some great marketplace of ideas that allowed diverse views to all exist and contribute under one umbrella. I'd love to see how his views would have changed with the advent of the GOP and Democrats and Republicans being (somewhat accurately) paralleled with gang allegiance.

And I could think of all these things off the top of my head. Just some short conversations with my brother in law school would probably give me a dozen more rounds of ammunition.

""Man has no property in man; neither has any generation a property in the generations which are to follow. The Parliament or the people of 1688, or of any other period, had no more right to dispose of the people of the present day, or to bind or to control them in any shape whatever, than the parliament or the people of the present day have to dispose of, bind, or control those who are to live a hundred or a thousand years hence...The circumstances of the world are continually changing, and the opinions of men change also; and as government is for the living, and not for the dead, it is the living only that has any right in it. That which may be thought right and found convenient in one age, may be thought wrong and found inconvenient in another"" --Thomas Paine, Rights of Man 1791

That's what one of our founding fathers would have said about about your Constitution worship.

">As a result, you are postulating a gravitational world in which exploding fuel is not enough to propel its own mass upward - you are going to have to need much stronger gravity than 2.125X in order to achieve this.

How could you possibly interpret that as what I am saying? I'm not saying that nothing can go upwards in this world. Instead I'm saying in this world where the exploding fuel would not be enough to propel an object 60 miles into space. . Of course a rocket could still go upwards in this world, the point would be that the force of gravity would be too strong to get it up enough. 

>If fuel cannot propel itself off the ground, it is not fuel. You are talking about a universe in which there is no combustible substance that has more potential energy, releasable through a chemical process, than its own resting potential energy. To put it another way, you do not have to add fuel to a ship JUST to compensate for the weight of the existing fuel - it is a ratio of the output power of the fuel + the dead weight vs. the necessary escape velocity.

This is just absolutely flat out wrong. You say you're a physics major? What if I add fuel to the 3rd stage of rockets, because you know, rockets have stages (sorry just trying to be equally condescending back to you as you are to me) Then for the 1st stage to get to it's designated altitude, it will have to adjust for that extra pound of fuel. You have to add more fuel to the 1st stage in order to achieve the necessary velocity. Please, look at this, think about it.  http 

>You are trying to talk about a planet where there is no chemical combustion known to man that is capable of propelling things up. I ask you to think about the outrageous force of substances like TNT, and then think about the sort of gravitational field where if you put one kilogram of tungsten on top of one kilogram of TNT and blew it up, it would just get super hot and melt into the ground, instead of propelling the tungsten upward. I assure you, it would be a world without trees, and likely without complex organic life as we know it. In fact, with gravity that high, the 'planet' would likely be a superhot mass of dense elements. Again, I do have a degree in physics.

No one is saying anything remotely related to this. Again I have no idea how you could have possibly interpreted this as to be my point. 

>I applaud you for sticking to all this, however. I sincerely advise you to get The Physics of Star Trek, by Laurence M. Krauss. It talks about stuff just like this, and Krauss is a famous professor of physics.

Well; WCCFTech's very own interview showed what I was saying, and to boot, both Extremetech and WCCFTech have a history of reporting rumors as truth. They simply aren't reliable sources. Furthermore, in your TechReport source, they're entire premise is on the fact that tessellation was in use; not that they knew what was being tessellated. I hate to be captain fucking obvious but it has been common practice for a long time to occlude objects that are not scene. Crysis 2, no doubt did this, and thus any tessellated objects that were not in-sight in the scene are effectively non-existent. In your third article they source an article that claims Watch Dog's performance issues can be attributed to gameworks, which is a blatant jump of conclusions. The game is a mess and favors NVidia cards no doubt, but there is 0 reason to make their conclusion. And again, I must state that, as per the WCCFTech interview, it is up to developers how they plan to optimize and implement the graphical effects from NVidia.

And also some of the shittiest development cycles; Assassin's Creed Unity prefered NVidia, but it still ran like shit. Arkham Knight as well. Project Cars has addressed their issue iirc; and again, it is up to them to implement it and they are an indie studio. The Witcher 3's devs decided not to allow people to change the tessellation which effected both brands, Crysis 2's tessellation was occluded and thus irrelevant, Arkham Origins ran fine on most hardware, Watch_Dogs was shit all over, and I don't even know what to say about WoW.

>This is much more than the two games you mention.

Naturally. NVidia tends to win across the board on any DX11 game, because their DX11 drivers are just flat-out better. But regardless of that, many of the games you list had issues outside of Gameworks that very well could contribute to the issue.

>Your other comments show a rather significant lack of understanding of graphical processes and of how the GameWorks program works.

Or perhaps you're an idiot.

>Tessellation occurs before culling

Tessellation occurs before culling; however if all of those triangles are culled it does not matter. If tessellation itself really effects AMD performance that bad, then it's tough shit. Tessellation is a very easy and cheap way to add more geometry to things without ridiculously upshooting the triangle count. To not use it would be stupid, and to restrict it just for AMD cards would be furthermore stupid. But that's irrelevant, because as I said with The Witcher 3; it is up to the devs how they configure tessellation, and whether or not they allow the player to configure it as well.

>The GameWorks program is meant to be a gray-box API, so even though the programmers are free to use it as they will, its performance is still effectively up to Nvidia to choose.

No; they are allowed to modify and optimize the code as they please. You should read the WCCFTech article even though it makes shit conclusions, the interview is very important to this discussion.

>If you willfully decide not to see the evidence laid in front of you

I'm seeing your 'evidence' and it's only slightly better than he-said-she-said. It's literally a bunch of circumstantial evidence with a whole shitload of assumptions.

>your conclusion that the issue does not exist is laughable.

I tend not to want to make 3 fucking assumptions to make a conclusion. I mean we make these assumptions:

A) NVidia is actively forcing devs to implement more tessellation.

B) The added tessellation is for the explicit, or almost explicit, purpose of degraded AMD performance.

C) That NVidia does not allow devs to change the tessellation amount or make a configuration menu for it.

It's ridiculous.

That sounds like a great idea, and completely legal.

>further subsidizing to keep the competition out.

Or, get this, or they're doing it because it makes them more money. They're a business not a charity.

>They are literally losing billions of dollars per year maintaining this strategy

If they are making any margin at all they are making a profit. Period. Even if it was less than before. Furthermore; if they raise their price they'll become less competitive. You have no reason to complain because the alternative to be suggested is that Intel be forced to sell at a higher margin, which is not only anti-consumer, but would be enforcing extra market share for Intel's competitors. Being more competitive =/= being anti-competitive.

>which you would know if you were even mildly read up on the subject.

Them selling their shit at a loss is not anti-competitive. It is the literal opposite. The fact that this is the most competitive Intel has ever been makes me want to smash your nose in. You want to punish them for trying to do things the right way too? Or do you just not want them to be competitive at all?

>If you fail to see that a company that has repeatedly found guilty of anti-competitive practices and had to pay billions of dollars in fines is still up to shady business

>But you already said you can currently do that and that you won't be any good if you choose to do so

Again, you're making an assumption that I use a spacebar macro when there is nowhere that I claim that I do. In fact, I have several keybinds that I've customized (it's unique to me, so I have a different setup than most):

Tab: suite of attack oriented abilities.

L-Alt: Emergency powers, tactical team.

R: RSP and resists.

T: Polarize Hull to break tractor beam (assuming I have PH1 on my build at the time)

L-SHIFT: Hull heals.

L-CRTL: Shield heals. 

ALSO: I have a Logitech G600 mouse, and I use the G9-G14 keys for special captain abilities and power increasing abilities. 

But no. You just assumed I use a spacebar keybind. Because?

Anyway, the rest of your post is condescending ranting, again because you're making assumptions. 

Brass Tacks: Putting all your shit on a spacebar keybind if fucking dumb. I'm sure others have a MUCH better keybind design than me, but what is illustrative of my setup is the versatility to time things when I want them. Even the order of abilities within my keybinds are specifically chosen and suited to how I personally play. THAT'S why I said (note my emphasis): 

>I encourage people to have a keybind system that's logical to them (its generally lazy and unproductive to just have all abilities going on all the time with just one keybind).

By ""one keybind"" I was inferring the spacebar keybind that you assumed I was implementing but in actuality I'm criticising.

>Right but somebody spending $1000 on an item they want and gambling mechanics designed to prey on addicts and children are two different things.

Usually those expensive items are result of those items being rarely obtained because of either low print or low chances both in physical card games and in digital games. 

>They don't. Just like they don't have all the responsibility to stop underage gambling smoking and drinking. They can help though for sure.

Smoking and drinking are far different from having a direct access to your CC to spend how much ever they want on stuff. Shit, if they have unlimited access to CC they might as well be buying far different things from loot boxes.

If you just let your kid loose with money beyond his/her dreams and give no guidance hoping that the government does all the guidance you're in for a bad experience. 

>No they don;t.

Yes they do. It's been something that's been repeated since the beginning ""WON'T SOMEBODY PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN"" and forgoing any parent responsibilities or studies to show how harmful it is or basically anything just to garner sympathy.

And seeing as you're ignoring how physical products that are produced in the same way as digital products to make you take chances of obtaining what you want while touting about ""think about the children"" you're not much different in this regard. I say this because Pokémon cards for example are directly aimed at children. If those cannot turn people into gambling addicts then why would digital goods that are worthless to you (since you can't turn them into a massive loss anyway) turn people into gambling addicts?

>Do you know how the world works ? Are you young ?

Seeing this advocacy for government to regulate games makes me think that it's not working well. Like said in the thread on /r/gaming ""Old enough to die in a war, but too young to a buy a video game, what a joke."" You can also replace war with things like cancer sticks, alcohol, driving, voting and more. And you can replace the video game with ""buying Pokémon cards"" as well.

>It isn't. There are links and studies with gambling to addiction and lives ruined. There are no links and or studies to videogames and violence.

Yes it is. You have no studies to show the link between loot boxes, trading cards and the like with gambling addiction or otherwise you would've already shown it. You just keep claiming there are studies with gambling (again, the pure money win/lose kind).

>There are no links and or studies to videogames and violence.

There are studies that prove against it. That's why people agree with it. But with lootboxes people are basically making claims with no proof.

>The cost of tuition for public schools has always been increasing since its inception. Therefore your argument that ""tuition (for colleges) has been going up in price for years"" isn't an argument at all in itself.

I honestly don't know what the fuck your point is. When I said that, it was to demonstrate that our tuition has been increasing for a lot of reasons. To suggest that not only will Bernie curb that increase, but eliminate tuition altogether is impractical, that's what I meant.

I just graduated with a CS degree in December so fuck you, and my ex led student protests at UC Berkeley so double fuck you. I'm aware of what they've been protesting, but saying the price goes up because ""I accept the status quo"" is a retard level oversimplification. 

To answer your question, I do think Hillarys plan is more likely to succeed. For a lot of reasons. Bernies plan is based on variable taxes - they don't even know how much exactly will be generated. We would have to agree on how that is done, and that's at best 2/3 of the cost. The states would have to front the rest, and his plan means $75 billion annually, while Hillarys plan is a ten year one. Her plan is a practical one to reduce the miserable student debt situation we currently have in the US, while Bernies is to create a huge, indefinite drain with uncertain funding. Hillarys plan involves pumping money into states for education spending before asking them to front more of the cash. Bernies plan seems to have other pitfalls. For example, opening up tuition to everyone means you would have hugely more kids going to college, especially skipping community college which is a much cheaper alternative and is very valuable for students (like myself) that weren't sure what they wanted to do straight out of high school. If university level tuition is suddenly free, there would more students, more drain, and lower graduation percentage. Countering that, Hillarys plan includes measures to make community college free for all. Another reason - free tuition for all means the wealthy and middle class who are capable of paying pay the same amount as the poor. Hillarys plan would tailor tuition costs to the family, requiring work hours in some cases. In one of the articles I linked at the bottom, it tells of what happened in New York when a college offered free tuition. Spending doubled and was such a drain on the city that it was cancelled within a few years. Think of that on a national scale. There are so many factors it's hard to easily talk about everything, but I think there's reason to support a more conservative, thought out plan. Again, I'm not saying I don't want free tuition. I'm saying that our problems are so complex that what we need are practical solutions whose long term effects we can anticipate. 

>Serious question: why do you Americans accept so little? At least if you aim higher you might settle with something wonderful. Right now you're just aiming for the same old status quo.

Fuck you and your condescending attitude. If you wanted to have an actual discussion with someone without them hating you, you'd cut that shit out. What you want is to grandstand and feel superior.

"> That's abdicating responsibility. Yes, the player can choose between different options; but it's the responsibility of the developer to make sure that the choice between those options is interesting and fun.

The developer knows that different people will find different things interesting. Instead of trying to tailor his game to fit every possible demographic simultaneously, the developer can instead create a set of options which, in certain configurations, would fit one particular demographic, for each of his target demographics.

I do not believe that the developer has to tell the player what is fun. The role of a developer is to create a game which the player will find fun. He gives the game to the player, and the player decides for himself what is fun. 

> For example, when deploying units in Fire Emblem you typically have about thirty units to choose between. Would that choice be more interesting if there were three hundred units? Or thirty thousand units? Obviously, since developers are restrained in terms of resources, things rarely get into that territory, but there is no reason to be biased in one direction over another.

It can happen with randomly generated characters, such as in Darkest Dungeon. In fact one of the selling points of Darkest Dungeon is that each character comes with a randomly generated set of buffs and debuffs, making them feel unique. They randomly gain more buffs and debuffs as the player progresses. The game certainly has not suffered for that.

> Amelia

I have already said that some players choose weak options precisely because they are weak. Not every challenge has to be a LTC. Some challenges can be forcing yourself to use only weak units.

> Yes, the player may choose to ignore that option, but it is not up to the player to ignore the design mistakes of the developer, it is up to the developer to not make design mistakes in the first place.

This is where I have to repeat my earlier point that the designers cannot please everyone, but they can give the players enough options such that for every demographic in their player base, a subset of those options exist which will satisfy that demographic. It is up to the players to figure out what they like - perhaps they may even find the journey of discovery enjoyable.

SSBM was not designed for tournament play. To get the game to a tournament-worthy state, the community banned all but 6 stages. Does that mean that the other stages were design mistakes? Clearly not - they serve a purpose in single-player modes, or casual play.

> I agree that it is possible to have too few options, but that does not follow that we should always be biased in favor of more options over fewer options. 

That is your opinion and I can respect that. I believe that erring on the side of more options gives the player more freedom to customize a set of options that he feels comfortable with. The game is more likely to appeal to more demographics of players. For RPGs in particular, the appeal of customization is even stronger. Why deny your playerbase something that they want?

For multiplayer games where the players' objectives are primarily to win, I have no arguments there - the developers should be diligent in weeding out options that are too weak or too strong. However, if the game is not built for competitive play but the playerbase wants it to be, then the responsibility of deciding upon options lies with the community, like with SSBM.

I have never been without at least one weapon in the house. I have also never, ever negligently or accidentally discharged a firearm. Get a hold of yourself, already.

>Professionals like Costa, Haley, or even the master Jeff Cooper (R.I.P.) would agree with me.

Argument from authority is a logical fallacy and is indicative of desperation in a discussion.

>Weapons are weapons

Agreed.

>Just because it's sitting alone on a table doesn't magically change what it is.

You're right, it doesn't. It's an inanimate object that is not inherently dangerous without use or misuse by someone_.

>They are dangerous plain and simple and they deserve no DEMAND your respect.

Again, get a hold of yourself. I absofuckingloutly respect my weapons. That's exactly why I don't have ND problems. 

That is exactly my point. They are inanimate objects that are incapable of causing harm by themselves. It is the responsibility of the operator to respect its potential for harm and to secure and handle it accordingly.

Your assertion that the gun itself is dangerous is a fear tactic used by the anti-gun lobbyists to make people afraid of the guns themselves. What people should be afraid of is irresponsible use, handling, and storage of guns.

It's the same with chainsaws, nail guns, wood chippers, vehicles, cranes, and standing near the edge of cliffs. If someone is an irresponsible idiot around any of those things, they will hurt themselves or someone else. All of those things ""DEMAND respect,"" but the object in question isn't to blame, barring a malfunction.

If your thesis is that 'God' is an idea that really represents human thought, emotion, behaviour and doesn't have an independent existence, you could have stated that first up. That's interesting.

On a side note, it has nothing to do with ethics. It's just what I think is best for my relationship with my kids. I lie to them all the time. I have no problem lying to them. But I don't lie about things that I think they're going to find out about, or longterm things.

I know what a demilich is dude; you're sounding kinda unnecessarily condescending. Demiliches are described decayed liches in 5e, though their original publication as Acererak wasn't, instead being the physical anchor for the Lich's free-roaming spirit. Mechanically the original demilich wasn't even a real enemy, basically just a strange trap in a room in effect.

But I'm using the monster manual description of a Demilich (combined with some info from the forgotten realms wiki) which states that a demilich is the decayed form a soul-deprived lich, and further, this lich was using it's own eye-socket gems for it's phylactery, so:

>a demilich can reclaim its former 
power by feeding just one soul to its phylactery. Doing 
so restores the demilich to lich form, reconstituting its 
undead body. (MM page 49)

so this Demilich could return to Lichdom after it killed and absorbed a single ensouled creature using its Trap Soul move. I changed the timeframe from 24 hours to 0 hours for dramatic effect.

>Also, I can't blame you for using the term demilich

I think the term refers to the fact that a Demilich is the hateful spirit and undead might half of a lich, leaving behind the arcane physical, and temporal might half. (probably more metaphorical than physical halves tbh) I think the name makes more sense for the original depiction of them, which differs from their more modern version."

You're not married to your girlfriend, so I don't see why that question is relevant.

I think it's pretty damn clear based on all of the backstory on your relationship you've provided. You guys are codependent on each other, and it's time to call it quits so you can each learn to be dependent. Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. As I said, if you want to give specific reasons, such as the codependency, that's up to you. But this letter is not only over the top, it's very condescending to her.

"> I'm also not a political neophyte and don't hold this naive ideal that a politician (including Mr. Sanders) won't say or do things for political gain.

""The cynic mistakes his cynicism for realism. He wants us to discard the hopeful things that touch his wound, to settle for what is consistent with his lowered expectations. This, he says, is realistic. Ironically, it is in fact cynicism that is impractical. The naive person attempts what the cynic says is impossible, and sometimes succeeds.""

Also I never said that Sander's wouldn't do things for political gain. But you are viewing the world in black and white here... its a false dichotomy that you are imposing in order to make Sanders and Clinton seem equally untrustworthy. ""They either do things for political gain or they don't"".

The way I see it, nobody is perfect. Sanders is not Jesus Christ reborn, hes just another mortal. But he is a good human, and mostly sincere in what he says. That's a quality that is hard to find in most politicians, who seem to be out for themselves and put their personal ambition ahead of the needs of the country they are supposed to be serving.

Now you can bluster and condescend that any who would think Sanders is genuine is a ""neophyte"", but in the end your opinion is only based on your predisposed, jaded notion of the world, not on the facts at hand.

">Wrong! Because the measures don't work!

What measures are you talking about? I agreed that high tech panties etc. probably don't work but there are plenty that probably do. At the very least against stranger rape. Are you arguing that keeping your drink with you at a bar doesn't help deter potential rapists from putting date rape drugs in it? Or that traveling in large groups won't make most rapists more hesitant to target a member in the group? Or that learning self-defense strategies to physically fight off rapists can't get them to stop? 

Here is a recent case where a woman fought off her rapist with a cooking pan  http  Are you saying that telling women to take objects in their surroundings to fight off their rapists if they are attacked doesn't work? Because this story proves that you are fucking wrong. 
A couple more:
 http 
 http 

Would have happened if you told these women ahead of time that there was nothing they could do to stop a rapist and they believed you? What if you told them that they should just allow themselves to be raped and hope that in the future other rapes could be prevented by educating their rapists?

>Wrong! Because the measures don't work! Which anybody knows who has actually researched this topic. And you are doing some serious harm by perpetuating the myth that you can protect yourself from rape.

Well my examples which I found in 5 seconds doing google say otherwise. You are the one doing serious harm suggesting that people are powerless to help themselves. Would you go into a dive bar and leave your drink unattended for two hours? Would you leave your door unlocked in the evening if you lived in a bar part of town (a perfectly reasonable thing to do to prevent all crimes btw)? There are some basic things you can teach people that can help.

Finally, you need to consider that there is no way of getting data on how successful these things are, because there is no way for a woman to know whether or not she would have been raped if she didn't take these measures. She won't know if a man considered putting date rape drugs in her drink if she hadn't been so careful. the fact that there are no stats or studies on how successful keeping your drink with you is to stopping being raped by date rape drugs doesn't mean that it isn't effective simply there is no way to get that data. Common sense suggests it is a very smart thing to do.

>No, it really doesn't. First of all, of course repeat offenders find their victims in their own circles. Where else? In a dark alley? Oh please.

Why don't you drop the condescending attitude and just acknowledge that this does happen. I am not saying they are the majority, but stranger, predator rape does exist. Are you aware of the Original Night Stalker who raped 50 people? I acknowledge situations like that are less common than rapes from people who know their victims, but we would do everyone a disservice pretending they weren't out there. A simple Google search will show stranger rapists attack every day. In the case of the Original Night Stalker he stopped operating in that area when women started enhancing security and more people started paying attention to suspicious activity in the neighborhood. That is a total coincidence to you, right?

>Not really. You are forgetting that most rapists think what they are doing is normal and that pretty much everybody does it, which gives them a stamp of approval in their mind. If our society made it impossible for them to believe that by consistently demonstrating contempt for any form of sexual violence, things would change. 

You are making a lot of assumptions here. The fact someone is using an argument to justify their actions doesn't mean they will be changed. I am sure what you said is true for many people, but others will not be changed. Many rapists know they need to say something to get a lighter sentence. Do you think they are going to admit that they are selfish assholes when they are arrested? Anyone who is arrested is going to try to downplay their responsibility when they realize they can't overturn the evidence. Their words are unrelaible so using them to come up with a solution doesn't help.

>No, it doesn't. Because you cannot protect yourself from rape. That is a myth. Seriously, how is that supposed to work???

>Things would also change if girls were brought up to be less submissive and selfless but instead with more agency and self worth, because that would make them a lot harder to be coerced, which is btw a part of pretty much every rape.

Did you see how you contradicted yourself here? You say there is nothing we can to do to teach people not to be victims but then go on to say that we should teach girls to be more assertive so that they can't be coerced into being raped. So which is it?

>Edited to add: The solution is to get rid of rape culture. Why? Rape culture allows rapists to believe what they are doing is normal, it prevents victims from coming forward, it often prevents the police and prosecution from doing their job when victims do come forward by having way more doubt regarding the victim's story than is justified. Rape culture has also, in the minds of most people, turned rape into a crime that only horrific monsters who are practically foaming at the mouth commit, which makes it hard for pretty much everybody to believe that Joe Normal is a rapist (even though most rapists are Joe Normals). The reason for that last issue is that our society silences rape victims, so we never hear the stories about how Joe Normal raped someone. You will never, ever significantly lower the number of rapes unless you get rid of rape culture, because it causes all those things that make life easy for rapists.

Why is there one solution? There are different types of rapists out there and the solution needs to be different. Some are people who were brainwashed by rape culture and some are just pure sociopaths. It is perfectly possible to focus on both. That is like saying ""we shouldn't give sick people medicine. We should just teach people how to keep themselves from getting sick instead."" There is no reason for the two to be mutually exclusive and you aren't sending conflicting messages by doing so."

I want to clarify that the intent of my post was to somehow justify debating theism and atheism with those who are not interested or unwilling.

Going from a Christian to an atheist is an emotionally draining process for many. Admittedly, early on as I was losing my faith in my early 20s, I would purposely seek to engage anyone in this type of debate. And partly is was due to anger and a feeling of isolation at the time when it was a community I knew my whole life. This isn't the case now. Now it's explaining to another person why I have difficulty accepting the same view as them.

If someone demands stuff on Valentines Day then they don't care about the person who doesn't want to celebrate it. That's why that's flawed logic."

I think I'm still pretty lucid.

So, that. Been working nonstop with upper level math and CS stuff for the past two weeks straight. Took procrastination break, was kinda disinhibited, and happened to come across a post that touched on one of my current frustrations in an unusual place.

You'll have to excuse me if my post in /r/OkCupid amounts to more of a (somewhat deliberately) goofy and disjointed rant than a stinging indictment of publishing standards in CS.

>Perhaps you could elaborate as to why you dislike computer scientists so much?

I don't. CS just interfaces with a stupid-huge number of other research areas and it's kind of a maddening state of things currently. 

There's all this work emerging on (sometimes) sexy, (sometimes) new disciplinary intersections and just generally along the periphery of CS now that seems — at present, at least — to end up being sufficiently removed from the ""science"" core of CS to avoid too much scrutiny from that direction and sufficiently new/obscure/not-yet-ready-for-proper-integration to get much scrutiny from the direction of the other discipline either.

Kind of an expertise vacuum scenario happening in many cases.

So plenty of people are making their own rules as they go along, which isn't always a bad thing but often ends up having unintended consequences later on, when the field has become too established to uproot itself and restart from different first principles.

I just happen to be an edge case for interdisciplinary incompatibilities / discontinuities / related frustrations, because the stuff I study and research sits smack-dab in the middle of the murkiest, most expansive interdisciplinary clusterfuck out there: computational life / cogsci.

And a stupid-disproportionate percentage of the interdisciplinary headaches I encounter come from CS people, for whatever reason. Really does feel like compsci's collective cross-disciplinary background knowledge is significantly lower than that of any of the fields clustered around it — the ones I get to see much of, at least.



>you seem to have just marginalized the fucking shit out of them.

I don't think most or even a large minority of CS students fit the kinds of characterizations I gave. Most don't work on interdisciplinary stuff anyway.

It's just real easy for some serious bullshit to fall through the cracks in certain applied computing type areas at the current moment. Stuff that'd be caught and vigorously corrected elsewhere, I mean.

Maybe, but even if that were true, there's no rituatal built around it. We don't draw morality from it. It has none of the features we typically associate with religion other than it is ""believed."" THere are lots of things we believe which are not conclusively proven, but that doesn't make them religious in nature.

As I've pointed out before, these common aspects of the human psyche that you refer to transcend religion. REligion does tap into them, but it is not the only thing that does or can. 

> There are shades of centrality in atheism, much of it centered around the writings of Darwin, Sagan, and Dawkins. Dawkins is probably the closest thing popular atheist culture has to a pope. His writings are squarely evangelical.

Evangelical != religious. I don't know how many times I need to point this out. I asked you what the dogma was, not whether or not they are evangelical. 

> In most cases, they probably subscribe to a dogmatically materialist view of reality-- that all things that are real must be personally apparent and manifest physically.

Find me an atheist who believes that ideas are not real. 

> Although modern scientific culture (real science has no certainty) lauds this belief as the most plausible, it's still quite dogmatic and requires a degree of faith in the secular foundations of academia.

Secular and religious are, by definition, mutually exclusive. So you have some semantic difficulty in your paragraph there. 

> If people are ""evangelizing"" something, then they are employed in a religious behavior

No. Evangelism is NOT a primary feature of religion. What you are talking about is some other human tendency which religion just happens to utilize in SOME cases. Many, many religious people are happy with their religion and they don't evangelize at all. 

> If they're evangelizing a higher truth or reality that is outside human understanding (like whether or not there is a higher power), then it's distinctly religious evangelism. 

No, it is anti-eligious evangelism.

These things are all well defined, and your attempt to categorize left and right as entirely a social issue in the United States is quite frankly condescending as hell.

You know why the right is markedly religious? Solely because the left, for the last two hundred years, is anti religion. The religious flock to the side that doesn't want to set up the state as god. 

>They then associate far left with communism and far right with nazism, discounting how similar the economic systems of each two are.

Correct, they are both left wing. The idea that the Nazis are or ever were right wing is propaganda coming from the left wing converged education systems. 

>Something you'll notice a lot is that people always seem to include communism and say it's only an economic system

It's not an economic system in the first place. It's a crusading utopian ideology that wants to violently abolish the existing, functioning economic system, in the name of the false god of equality. There is no real workable plan for communist economics, in the Soviet Union they tried to make plants share and caused a famine for fuck's sake. They might as well be watering plants with Gatorade for all that communism actually has an economic model. It has a few high concepts and that's it.

> Originally, the left was socially liberal(for the time) capitalists

Not really. Revolutionary France was basically a proto communist movement. You can always spot those because of the militant atheism that goes hand in hand with communism throughout all of Western history.

The water molecules have come together to form the liquid. The liquid is a single body. If you want to argue against that, you are telling me that you want to throw logic out the window (as if you haven't already done that).

Of course it's possible to argue that everything is always priced in, and it's impossible to prove that that's not the case. But Trump's 538 chances have gone from 11% on August 15th to 31.8% today. Look at the market over that same period. VTI is slightly up from that date.

Talking about 'woo-woo' concepts and beliefs that you do not accept. When you talk about 'sin'? You are talking jibberish to me. Don't like it? Demonstrate the existence of sin, and stop crying about how mean Atheists don't curtail to your religious arguments.

Do you believe in Feng Shui? If you don't, what use would it be for me to tell you how to live your life based on Feng Shui? Wouldn't you want me to demonstrate that it exists, before telling you how to behave based on this spurious claim?

>but really respecting them as intellectuals.

So I'm supposed to assume that everyone I meet is an intellectual? Surely, I should wait until they've demonstrated that? As said, people may deserve respect. But not ideas. Especially not the idea that 'sin' exists. Not until it's been demonstrated.

Spiritual and Atheists. 'Not believing in a god' doesn't stop you from being spiritual, at all. Just look at prominent Atheist Sam Harris.

> I hope you find rich spirituality,

I hope I 'find' whatever is true. I have no interest in wishful thinking or comforting lies. I want to believe as few false things and as many true things as possible. Spirituality seems to be a grab-bag of all of these. Never have they been demonstrated, and thus, I have no reason to believe in them. Does that mean I think there's nothing to spirituality? No. Just that I think the time to believe is when we have evidence for the claim. Not a moment beforehand."

I’m not sure if your purpose was to come off as condescending or not, but, regardless, with how this game has been since it released a year ago, we’ve had two expansions. We had the Unidad Conspiracy and the Peruvian Connection bosses. We’ve also had the not so loved arrival of lootboxes.

Yes, I’m even a little envious of how much PvP gets updated, which in turn, adds new things.

Do I want more things to do? Fuck yes, I do, but wanting more content comes with a price. A price that some will pay, but I’m not about to drop $30 dollars on a season pass when a quarter, if not more, is for the game’s PvP, which I have no drive to play. Do I see your point? Most definitely, and I don’t disagree either. Do I see why Ubisoft did this? Yeah, I don’t like it, but I could see why. Welcome to modern gaming I guess is the moral of this story."

"> You haven't. You really haven't. 

I really have. It's very interesting to me that you guys seem to view this as a contest of wit or intellectual might. San Antonio is a backwater. It's a fact. If you had been to any number of other cities you would know this immediately upon experiencing them. I love my hometown. I even used to have a massively inflated opinion of it, much as you folks apparently do. I used to think it was a great city, that we had huuuuuge companies and big transportation systems and massive international importance. We have none of those things. No one outside the US even knows what San Antonio is, and even people in DFW and Houston regard it as a poor, deprived brother - and this is something the economic statistics bear out. 

The point is, when you enter a discussion like this you can do it with hostility, or curiosity. Every single person here (with the possible exception of you, though I do consider you condescending tone to be pretty hostile) has responded with hostility - which is something I understand, when you feel inferior you tend to be very sensitive to that fact. I would always rush to the defense of San Antonio, as well. But now, having experienced the world I can see what San Antonio lacks. 

This gives me something important. Not perspective, but rather the ability to see what can be improved to make San Antonio a truly great city. There's a reason that the Demographers have us falling far behind Austin in population projections by 2050. There's a reason that Dallas and Houston, much larger cities than San Antonio, outgrow San Antonio every year despite the better economic growth numbers San Antonio often posts. 

It's not a ""fuck San Antonio"" kind of comment. It's a ""man, I wish San Antonio would get off its ass and start becoming what it can be."" I wish I felt as much pride in San Antonio as I once did - but the real world shattered that illusion for me a long time ago. And frankly, this is a good thing. You can't learn anything until you pierce your ignorance. That's ultimately why I'm sticking with this conversation, rather than ""quitting while I'm ahead."" It's because the more people who see what can be improved and work diligently towards it, the faster it will happen.

That's a good joke, made me audibly laugh.

It's funny that you skipped over the first sentence in the article:

>The term “atheist” describes a person who does not believe that God or a divine being exists. 

And the next paragraph...

>And they have argued that the evidence in favor of God’s existence is too weak, or the arguments in favor of concluding there is no God are more compelling.

And some other sentences:

>There have been many thinkers in history who have lacked a belief in God.

>So negative atheism would includes someone who has never reflected on the question of whether or not God exists and has no opinion about the matter and someone who had thought about the matter a great deal and has concluded either that she has insufficient evidence to decide the question, or that the question cannot be resolved in principle.

And...

>Atheism can be narrow or wide in scope. The narrow atheist does not believe in the existence of God (an omni- being). A wide atheist does not believe that any gods exist, including but not limited to the traditional omni-God. The wide positive atheist denies that God exists, and also denies that Zeus, Gefjun, Thor, Sobek, Bakunawa and others exist. The narrow atheist does not believe that God exists, but need not take a stronger view about the existence or non-existence of other supernatural beings.

Ah, why even bother? You're just going to once again ignore the parts that you disagree with.

I will though say that I disagree in many parts of that article. And many others. Like this one:

>Agnosticism is traditionally characterized as neither believing that God exists nor believing that God does not exist.

What then is gnosticism? Knowing that there is a god and that there isn't a god? Talk about confusing the issue. That term doesn't even make sense with that definition. I am learning that for many a self-claimed philosopher, that word definitions don't matter as long as they can inanely banter on for many pages of of text. It seems that thinking, learning and developing thoughts has been replaced by trying to overwhelm people with verbiage until they submit. Using a lot of words to say almost nothing.

>The IEP does then mention the lacking belief as negative atheism, but only to specifically distinguish it from the positive atheism definition they will use. 

Not just then, in many other parts as well. I suggest you read the whole thing. Check out near the end:

>20th century developments in epistemology, philosophy of science, logic, and philosophy of language indicate that many of the presumptions that supported old fashioned natural theology and atheology are mistaken.

Things are changing, philosophers use the same definition I use, not all of them, but then I'm not making the mistake of generalizing all philosophers.

>Here is the definition they use -

One of them. Once again, you seemed to have missed the other ones.

>So philosophers don't use the same definition we use here.

I await your evidence to support your claim. I have provided some evidence, nearly every definition of the term atheist supports me, and there are a number of philosophers that do as well.

Bertrand Russel:

>There is exactly the same degree of possibility and likelihood of the existence of the Christian God as there is of the existence of the Homeric God. I cannot prove that either the Christian God or the Homeric gods do not exist, but I do not think that their existence is an alternative that is sufficiently probable to be worth serious consideration. Therefore, I suppose that that on these documents that they submit to me on these occasions I ought to say ""Atheist"", although it has been a very difficult problem, and sometimes I have said one and sometimes the other without any clear principle by which to go.

Though it is true that he also described it as the other, the point is that philosophers do also use the same definition I do. There is a whole list of atheist philosophers that use the same definition I do, but I do not currently have the time to go in an find all the citations. Dennett is one, Harris another (even though I have many an issue with Harris).

>It may appear that way to you, but sometimes what initially appears to us to be true, turns out to be based on a misunderstanding. They are not the reasons philosophers would reject it. 

It's not what initially appears to be, it's what it eventually looks like, Try not to make unfounded assumptions.

>No they're not.

Yes they are. As I originally stated. Here is a link from the post you linked to:

>""‘Atheism’ means the negation of theism, the denial of the existence of God.""

Again, try to read both what I'm saying and at least what you link to. If you expect me to read through all that meaningless drivel, you could at least do the same. Did you read the thing you linked me?

>In our understanding, the argument for this broader notion was introduced into the philosophical literature by Antony Flew[...]

Hrm, a philosopher using that definition... just like I argued. Yeah, some of the older guys were resistant to the change, but that's not uncommon in philosophy. Things change in philosophy, and currently there are philosophers that use the definition ""non-philosophers"" use.

>The objection isn't that ""people"" are confused by the definition, it's that the definition ""confuses the issues""

What issues?

>This isn't the objection though. This isn't the objection though. The two possible positions it confuses are atheism and agnosticism. Using the lack of belief definition means it's not possible to distinguish between them.

Oh noes, whatever shall we do? I guess language better never change to adapt to the zeitgeist! Because we can't lose these precious words! Even if modern philosophy hadn't already adapted the language, I don't mourn the loss of a term, so many have gone by the wayside over the centuries.

>Since agnostic is a substantial and important position on the question, this feature makes the definitions unacceptable. 

Subjective, I don't agree that it's important at all, but go ahead and I'll listen to why you think it's important. But I very likely have already heard similar justifications to what you are likely to come up with.

>You're being very uncharitable in your reading of that post and to the opposing view generally.

That is a false statement. You cannot tell how charitable I am being with my conclusions. I have spent many a year dealing with it.

>They were responding to particular myths and addressing them directly.

The ""myths"" are myths themselves. Take the first one, worded as it is, it's not something that is common at all. Like many others who object to the same kind of argument, we can see the term having more than one meaning, not many argue that the only definition is the ""lack of belief."" But I'm sure, like anything else on the internet, you can find a few people that say otherwise.

>They were rebutting claims made by some atheists that this lacking belief definition is the only correct definition.

How charitable to address a minority, or in other words: either a straw man or a faulty generalization.

>Maybe consider the possibility you could be mistaken about this and read the post with that in mind. 

No worries, I always read with the possibility in mind that I might be wrong. If only you and that person you linked would do the same, we might be able to have a useful conversation. A conversation like the great philosophers of old, the ones that weren't arrogant and condescending. But I give what I get (minus the faulty reasoning), it's my major flaw. I am working on it, for instance: I took your condescending attitude, and instead of reciprocating it back to you equally, I toned it down a bit.

But I am done, doing most of the work here. I have spent time and effort on my last two posts with you and provided a number of citations to back up my statements. So, if you want me to make the effort to honestly read and address your points, then I expect the same from you."

">If you gave minorities the access (great healthcare, great education, clean parks, 

It isn't quite that simple. I live in Wake County, NC, which has a magnet school based bussing system that adds extra educational opportunities to schools in poor neighborhoods, which induces richer families to choose those schools, leading to voluntary desegregation. It is a good system, but the problem is that the students from disadvantaged neighborhoods produce more behavior problems, so the schools with more resources are still worse.

A similar issue exists with parks. Many readers will live in communities where the city has ""given"" the poor neighborhood a nice park, and it got trashed in a few years. I think the key word here is given. Poor people, or people of color, are disadvantaged, but they aren't helpless and passive. They need to build the resources that improve their community. Their skills and resources aren't as great, so wealthier neighbors need to invest a bit more, but if they don't engage in the process, it will fail as completely as nation building failed in occupied Afghanistan.

Are there some misguided fringe elements who do that and espouse some Aryan race superiority? Yes, just as there are Malaysian neo-nazis (seriously). Nobody takes them seriously and neither should they be used to generalize. 

Take a look at this thread of the one in r/Europe and point me to a single Armenian user who’s “begging” to be identified as European. People are just having a discussion and when questions about Armenia’s belonging to Europe pop up, we chime in. 

Like it or not Europe itself is trying to integrate Armenia into its sphere. The world isn’t a static place, it’s dynamic and evolving. A hundred years ago the world was separated at boundaries of vast competing empires, today it is markedly different.

">What your asking is impossible to provide. You have asked for statistics that scientifically prove each dogs breed that is involved in an attack, no I can't provide that, no one can.

No it isn't impossible to provide. You'd just have to find a way of determining what the dog breed was in a dog bite. So you'd only be able to examine confirmed cases where the dog was caught. If you did that, which I imagine people who agree with discriminating against certain dog breeds tried to do, I don't think you'd find a correlation.

>I would love to lock little kids in rooms with dogs that have had absolutely no human contact and see if some were more likely to bite the child than others. It's just that it is pretty sick to expect someone to hold such an experiment and it wouldn't be peer reviewed.

>If you want to see some impressive examples about impressive traits that can be bred into dogs, checkout the Kangal, linked above. Do you think there is any ability possibility you could teach a Chihuahua to guard a sheep and take down wolfs? why not?

Obviously size no need to be so condescending. This doesn't prove that one dog breed is more likely to involved in a dog attack than another. Other than obviously it's much harder for small dogs to attack. That doesn't account for the hate pits get compared to any other large breed.

>My argument isn't even that pi-bulls are inherently bad, it's just that when they are bad, they are the strongest, toughest most agile and persistent dogs there are that have proven themselves capable of killing humans time and time again. But i know you'll just respond with, but can they scientifically prove every fatal attack was a pit-bull as research has shown that some people incorrectly identify dog breeds.

Well excuse me for wanting scientific evidence before I start discriminating on breed/""race"".

Pit bulls bite strength isn't even the highest of all dog breeds. Mastiffs bite harder and there are many breeds of dog that bite in a similar high range to pit bulls. Do you have the same views on Akitas, Malamutes, Huskies, or any dog over forty pounds that could kill a person if it was in a pack?

You have no basis for your discrimination against pit bulls other than what you have heard. I've raised a few pit bulls and they have been some of the most gentle dogs I've ever had. The most recent runs away and pees if a dog looks at him sideways.

>All domestic dog breeds have been bred from wild wolves over the last couple of thousand years. A wolfs primary basic instinct is a hunting pack dog. If you think that all dogs are born the same and are taught to be bad. would you go pat a wild wolf since its only humans that make their dogs bad? Al wolf is just a breed of dog at the end of the day.

More straw man, I never said all dogs are born the same anymore than all people are born the same. I'm saying in fact that dogs in a breed are not all born the same. Or more predisposed to violence than another breed.

This whole point your making just validates what I'm saying. It's about how the dog is raised more than about what the dog is born to. Some dogs being able to round up animals doesn't prove that pit bulls are more dangerous.
 

>At the end of the day, even if every dog has exactly the same temperament, exactly the same mental stamina and aggression. There are only a few breeds with the ability to kill a human.

This is ridiculous and unsubstantiated, any dog over forty pounds stands a chance at killing a person. If only a few breeds had the ability to kill humans then you'd be able to demonstrate that easily by reviewing fatal dog bite attack records. You would be able to provide any kind of evidence at all that dog breed correlates to dog attacks. 

At the end of the day you are not providing any evidence that specific dog breeds are predisposed to violence. A claim like that requires proof. Proof that you cannot provide because it doesn't exist. I hope you're not so foolish as to ask me to do the impossible and prove a negative.

The problem with your link isn't that we can't confirm it was a pit bull it was that it is an anecdote. My argument isn't that pit bulls never attack. 

It isn't as if my claim that it's hard to determine breed is ridiculous. It is why the CDC decided to advise against breed specific legislation

>[Following a thorough study of human fatalities resulting from dog bites, the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) decided not to support BSL.

"(last continuation of replies)

>What's the point of this part? People don't invade for the rewards most of the time, either, but rather, because we enjoy chaotic, ruleless PvP.

My point here was just that when you are invading, you are doing so for yourself (in the average case- obviously like you said, some people do it just for PvP and don't need the items and some do it just to mess with people and make them laugh or whatnot)- to no benefit of the host. So, you should expect them (until otherwise proven in a given instance) to not want you there- and to try to get rid of you the best they can (even if it means recruiting help). You can't just invade someone and expect them to 1v1 you all the time because you want to make up the rules of the engagement, as nice as that might be at times. You've already forced them to either progress to the boss or fight you to the death- if they want to get some help, that's only fair (and that's also the way it's always been).

>Doesn't mean that the game should be designed in an unfair way.

You're right, it shouldn't be designed in an unfair way. Like I've said- I don't like the way things are weighted now. But, I also think that it's totally acceptable as an invader to possibly have to fight 2 or 3 people off- it's always been this way (Note: I do not think that it should be every fight) and I think it's entirely reasonable to allow the person who doesn't have a choice in being invaded a chance to leverage things to his side.

>Also, again, please stop acting like if every host and his phantoms are an innocent little nooblet.

I'm not. Again, no where am I saying everyone is a ""nooblet"" or ""innocent"". I'm simply talking about the average player- I understand that it's not always the case (experienced or new), but in a discussion like this you should not take the extremes and instead focus on what things are going to be like on the average. That is, after all, how they designed the game. They simply cannot try to build it for everyone, so instead they try to do it in general. So when I say things like ""the invader is trying to come to kill you for a tongue"" or ""blues are just trying to defend the host""- I'm not talking about every literal instance out there- I'm talking about the average circumstance, and what was designed on paper.

>If they didn't care of the invader they'd do the smart thing and ignore them to get to the fog.

Definitely a smart move- but still, not always. It's just one of those things that depends on what's going on, as the usual. Some times, you can't just ignore the invader and bolt for the fog gate because he might pick you off with say a Greatbow, or plunging attack and kill a phantom on your way there. It's all a game of ""what ifs""- but if they can get to the gate and don't want to fight, then yes they should.

If you've feel I've blatantly ignored anything you've touched upon outright, please, feel free to point it out- I'll be happy to let you know if I thought I had and where I thought I did.

>Real good argument right here.

Fair enough, it was late so I tried to end it quickly with just disagreeing. But, I guess we will cover it here anyways.

>I recommend checking anywhere that isn't DS where gank squads aren't a thing. In WoW, if you're a high level player or group of players and come into a low level player or single player in the middle of questing, and decide to go gank them, then that's as much as a gank as if you were waiting around for innocent players to gank.

I know, I played WoW for awhile. Horde side, Hellscream server. I'm aware of what ""ganking"" is in that game. But let's go on before I touch on it:

>I'm sure you know why. Because ""gank"" comes from ""gang kill"" and holds no other meanings, besides also evolving to refer to any situation where one party had no chances of winning (if you're a twink with maxed estus and endgame gear waiting for people on far greater disadvantages then you are ganking, even if alone).

You're almost there. I guess it really depends on personal view (however you grew up hearing it), but ""gank"" isn't just ""ganging up on one person(s) to give them a huge disadvantage"". It originally meant more along the lines of ""surprise killing someone(s) with overwhelming force"", with most of the emphasis on the ""surprise"" part. That is where the distinction is made- the intent. That's why when they are ""gank squads"" they are ""ganking""- because they are waiting for unsuspecting people to wander in, so they can use their numbers and (in the case of DS3) skill to beat on unsuspecting people. Or, like you pointed out in WoW- the gank was a gank not because they were at a disadvantage, but because when you jumped someone in World PvP with a group of people it was generally out of the blue (or even from stealth, as was one of the more popular ones) for the person being killed. They did not expect it; In DS3, you do not expect to enter a world full of people there simply to kill you.

I'd also like to point here for a moment, since you seemed to be hinged on it:

>any situation where one party had no chances of winning

Quite untrue. While it's true that on average the odds are against you, saying there is ""no chance"" is just a blatant lie. I know that I have personally beaten on a few gank squads- as I'm sure you have, and so have others. Even if they are around my skill level, it's still definitely possible to pull off a win- it's just not easily done.


>The actually funny thing here is how you defend the host in this thread so zealously (of anything, really) of being a ganker like if you're automatically placed on the same place that gank squad members are. You aren't, because a gank squad is a different thing from people who are ganking by chance.

I stand by everything I've said. They were not ""ganking"" anyone- but yes, they were trying to gang up on him. There is a distinction, ""squad"" or not.

>Since I actually put up my argument for this like twice and you didn't a single time, I'm guessing this is over here. 

You'd guess wrong. I've put plenty of arguments around, as have you (even though you constantly seem to think I'm saying an awful lot of things that I have never said in any of these posts). 

>Obviously, by saying this I pretty much guaranteed that you'll try to look for your way around it by nit-picking at the meaning of specific little details.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""nit-picking over specific details"". I understand the literal sense of what you're getting at- but this is an argument, that's almost inherently what you do. And, for the record- it's been going on from both sides, so it's interesting that this is one of your closing arguments.

>Internet pride is a real thing, after all.

You're right, it is. Again, funny how this is one of your closing remarks considering how vehemently you've been trying to disprove me from my original ""in my opinion, it's not a gank"" remark. I think this is a classic case of the Pot and the Kettle, friend."
"Wow I think you're going a little too hard for a simple reddit discussion. You keep pulling all sorts of one off and irrelevant stats for a discussion that we're not even having. I'll say it one last time and if you dont get it here then IDK what to tell you anymore. 

Popularity DOES NOT equal quality

A game can have a decent rating and still be a mediocre game

Your attempts to pull ratings and an assessment of one reddit thread in order to prove the quality of a game is laughable. 

We're talking about the game itself, not its reception. I said in my very first comment that the game is mediocre, meaning that the game itself is mediocre. Simply saying well it's got a decent rating doesnt do ANYTHING to prove the game's quality. 

>Proof by contradiction: let's assume what you said is true. I apply that criterion to the post I just linked to. I do a count of people who like the game, people who dislike the game, and people who mentioned the game but weren't easily classified.
Like: 24
Dislike: 5
Can't classify: 7
Even in that quick and dirty count, there were far more people liking it than disliking it. So your statement is disproven - at least some threads have people liking Octopath Traveler, so you can't rely on that generalization as evidence.

Did you seriously just try and use one reddit thread to prove your point here? If you REALLY want to get into the data you would have to not only pull a multitude of current threads about the game, but also count the upvotes on each comment rather than just counting the amounts of comments that are for or against the game. You know how data works right? This is extremely biased and short sighted. You cant just choose one thread and then skew the data like that to prove a point

>Admittedly an unclear definition. Define thriving. I'd call 20K+ subscribers from an install base of 1 million+ thriving. A comparable number of posts per day to /r/JRPG. More subscribers than some entire series (Dragon Quest with 18.9K). So no, I'm not exaggerating. I'm setting my standards according to similar Reddits.

It's just a normal community

>Sure. That said, I would need a good argument for why the initial reviews were wrong. I'd need evidence. I'd need logical support. Simply saying that reviews aren't 100% accurate does not justify taking a converse position.

Well you see the problem is that you want to debate reviews while I would rather debate actual points about the game. That's the only way where we could decide whether or not the game is mediocre. 

>Evidence lacking. Also irrelevant, since we're not talking about ""plenty of mainstream games,"" but Octopath Traveler.

Lmfao how is there evidence lacking here? And it's completely relevant. Games with decent scores can still be mediocre, how is that irrelevant? 

>Right, and I called that an exaggeration and appealed to several sources of evidence. None of my sources are definitive; I agree that reviews, that user ratings, that thread comments aren't 100% reliable. That said, they are somewhat reliable; they provide a counterargument that you need to build a case against if you want more people to agree with you.

So you called it an exaggeration and used scores to prove your point when we've already agreed that games can have decent scores and be mediocre...Once AGAIN, the only way to decide this is by debating over the game because the scores don't decide a games quality. If a game comes out and gets a good first impression/ Inflated scores because people are excited for a good old school JRPG, that doesn't tell us anything about the games actual quality.

>So here's where we are: you insist Octopath Traveler is mediocre, but seem unwilling to provide any evidence or arguments to support your case. I think that's an exaggeration, and I'm providing counterarguments to see if you can elaborate in some way. I already disagree with you. You disagree with me. Are you going to provide any more detail to make this conversation worthwhile for both of us, or are you going to double-down on what you're saying but continue to refuse to support your ideas with evidence?

Thats a nice biased outlook but Ill fix it up for you. HERES where we are. I said that Octopath traveler is a mediocre game, you keep pulling towards it's score and one single reddit thread with misinterpreted data to determine the games quality. You see where the disconnect is here right? 

>By the way, there's no shame about walking away, about not having the time, or not having the interest. If that's true, have a great day. I'm just interested in learning from people I disagree with, and I'd rather cut out the posturing as much as possible.

hahahah. Wow. Can you get any more condescending? Like honestly dude I love this whole ""Holier than thou"" approach you're taking while spending all of your time trying your hardest to prove what a brainiac you are. And after it all you try and play it off like you're looking for a meaningful discussion. Dont waste my time dude, don't bullshit me. You're not interested in learning from people you disagree with, not even a little. You want nothing more than to boost your ego by mentally declaring yourself the winner of some pathetic internet argument about a mediocre JRPG. You just want that last word so that you can walk around all day high off of the satisfaction of feeling like you're a little bigger online than you thought you were in real life. Stop lying to yourself and everyone around you. Have it your way, you don't have to respond if this conversation isnt doing anything for you. Lets see if your ego will allow you to not have the last word. "
">So I am ""fucking"" Daft, am I? There are no reviews for Mr. Robot, are there? Indie games do not have reviews, do they?

>You need to do your research before you open your mouth. Two seconds of google searching could have saved you from embarrassment. Feel free to go ahead and edit or delete your post.

Sigh. It's embarrassing that I have to explain the difference between a review, and a well read review.

Yes, there are reviews for those games. I am sorry that I was not excruciatingly explicit in my language, I made the mistake of thinking you'd understand my implication. I apologize, and I won't do that again.

I meant, reviews were not very publicized, the game was not very advertised, reviews never made it to any front page or stream I read, and discussion of the game(s) in question never entered into the forums which I read and post. 

>While that might have some truth to it, you cannot possibly compare video game piracy to racism. Seriously, this is just as bad as pulling the ""nazi"" card, and comparing DRM to hitler. The analogy does not hold up. When you pirate something, you are taking someone's hard work without permission. If you cannot see that, that is wrong, without it being illegal, then there is something wrong with your moral compass.

Whose hard work am I taking? The salaried programmer? The salaried artist? The hardworking manager? This isn't music, there isn't some starving artist huddling in a basement, meagerly attempting to make there way in their world.

The work is work for hire, and it is entirely a business venture, no different than surveying for oil or laying road. They are hired to perform a job, and they do so.

Their bosses work tirelessly, and pay millions to lobby for industry-favoring bills that strengthen copyright, stifle innovation, and protect profits. I don't support the perversion of government, nor the laws that they promote. C'est la vie.

>I would love to hear why, if you can restrain yourself from the childish insults.

You should do well to learn hubris. It's ironic that you chide me for childish insults while in such a condescending manner. It's a very immature attack, one common of a child. 

I make no qualms about insulting you, and I don't pretend I'm better than you. The fact that you pretend to be better than me, though, does speak volumes. "
">You are making another false equivalence...I would have to get better justifications than that.

Not all comparisons are meant to demonstrate total equivalence. I think native Americans taking over the US is not much less likely than the US becoming a white ethnostate. Nothing is much less likely than something that is very, very unlikely. All of your supposedly distinguishing differences mean nothing to my estimation of the likelihood of the AR successfully turning America into an ethnostate. I don't have to give you a better justification as to why I think the current trends will continue. I don't see any reason why they likely will not.

>Just on a personal note the idea of white ethnic extinction being inevitable reeks of white submissivism.

I do not believe I have presented this idea.

>The notion of multiracial, multicultural nations was a radical one...fringe political movements reaching their goals.

Sure, I don't doubt that it's possible. I just think it's very unlikely and would like to know more about why the AR seems to think it's likely.

>The AR doesn't need direct political power to get its will across. But no, to me it does not imply that. No one here expects Spencer and Anglin to be called up for the next administration. We expect guys who hide their power level or guys who do our bidding because they want our votes. The AR brand is unpopular but the ideas behind it are not.

Agreed on the first sentence, although I want to mention that direct political power is very important. I don't see how the AR is supposed to sneak into power if they are despised, and I think the idea of politicians caring about the minuscule AR voting bloc is laughable. The AR brand is unpopular because the ideas behind it are unpopular as well. I don't think I need to research the percentage of Americans that want an ethnostate. I think you're conflating.

>Again, a false equivalence. Repealing laws that where put in place 50 years ago is not analogous to returning to the ""state of nature"". I could agree that it is a revolution like the passing of the laws in the first place was a revolution. But the word ""revolution"" in that case sounds inflationary to me.

You don't seem to know what those words mean. Do you take issue every time someone you disagree with uses any analogy? Jesus Christ, dude. ( http 

>I don't understand where you get the idea that an ethnostate never existed in the US...Same goes for the US.

The US becoming an ethnostate had conflict too. Most of history had conflict. I don't understand your point here. You seem to be arguing that a US return to ethnostatehood would somehow decrease conflict, and I don't think that is intellectually honest. You also seem to be operating under the view that the US is already an ethnostate and that it simply needs to maintain this status with legal enforcement, and I find this to be insane.

>But in any case what you are talking about is already happening. There are large groups of whites creating clusters and enclaves around the US.

Could you give me an example of this? Specifically one that demonstrates your definition of the word 'large' in this sentence.

>And again, you lean on the current trends like a crutch as if there is no way to reverse them when you can do so easily

Well, I cited projections, not just current trends, but I don't think you'll find that distinction meaningful? And again, I am not saying that they cannot be reversed, only that it is very unlikely they are reversed, and asking why you all think they will be.

>But just for kicks here is a current trend for you: Conservative whites in the US are breeding at and above replacement level. That is, over 2.1 child per woman. Do you know what that means?

I think you might need to do a bit more research into this topic before you start asking condescending questions like this. Look up the birthrate and immigration rate for Hispanics, for example. 

>The whites that are dying out are majority left leaning. The future generations of whites will be more conservative and right wing.

The number of assumptions you have made here make me think that you haven't done a whole lot of research on this topic. People change political leaning. You know poor people have more kids than rich people too, does that mean eventually everyone will be poor? (another FALSE EQUIVALENCY!?) You're ignoring all sorts of other factors at play here to try to present your narrative. I don't find these sorts of discussions to be beneficial.

> I don't think whites will peter out and die like a warm gust of wind. I think in the worst case they will go to war to retake their country. I want to prevent that future by retaking the country peacefully while we still can.(This whole thing is getting pretty larp heavy though)

I don't view any of the scenarios you have described here as even remotely likely. What does larp mean here?

>Because the question you ask is based on your own misunderstanding and misuse of terms. Read the FAQ. The term you use: ""superior"" makes no sense without you giving it context. The fact that they score on average higher on the IQ test does not mean I should therefor want to live with them. Just like the low IQ of blacks doesn't mean I should therefor not want to live with them. Your logic doesn't make any sense. Dogs have low IQ's. The AR therefor must hate these inferior dogs.(Dogs are great btw)

I don't think you have understood me, and I think this will probably be the last time I feel like responding to you. I read the FAQ, and the [NEW] FAQ as I said in my OP. I have given the term context, and that context is that I do not understand how IQ and crime can be brought up in support of white superiority over blacks but IQ and crime can be dismissed in the support of asian superiority over whites. I have said nowhere that you should thereforE want to live with them. Dogs do not have IQs, that is an actual false equivalency. Also, nowhere did I say that you must thereforE hate anyone or any animal based on their or its IQ.

>The AR are WN because only whites can authentically maintain white society.
Your whole conflict rests on your own misrepresentation of what people here think.

Enlighten me then, what distinguishes the arguments A)Whites are better than blacks because of IQ and Crime and B)Asians are better than whites because of IQ and Crime? I haven't made my interpretation of what people here think so I find it very unlikely that the conflict rests on that.

>Superior in what way? Superior in being white and maintaining white society?...Being white is not one of them...People here don't do that and AR ideas are not based around such useless distinctions.

You know what I mean. I could cite all sorts of comments if I felt like it, but I don't. I don't think you are willing to discuss this in good faith.

>I don't understand what you think is untrue.

I am referring to your comment.
>And to further that point no one here denies the gains E-Asians have on Whites.

"> Your statement absolutely implies that we should have accepted Obama's campaign promise to close Guantanamo as a hypertechnical budgetary one. If

No I didn't. I said that Obama has taken steps towards closing the prison, and that Congress removed budgetary support for removing the last ~100 or so prisoners that are there. Obama was going to move them to federal prisons on the mainland, and Congress said 'no'. If Obama's budget for moving the prisoners is $0, he cannot move the prisoners, it's pretty simple.

Unlike a pardon, which is constitutionally granted to the President, Congress does have the authority of the budget, which is also constitutionally granted. So yes they do have authority over Guantanamo and moving prisoners. Although it's true that Obama could have cleaned up the prison instead of closing it, but that was not his campaign promise and he would've looked very duplicitous if he was cleaning up the prison while trying to close it.

Do you have specifics for what you wanted Obama to do that Congress could not have blocked if they wanted?

">Yes, the quality of privately provided public/common pool goods is amazing!

I never said anything about ""public goods"". You're putting words into my mouth.

>Have a look at some of the privatized prisons in the USA. They're shocking.

Umm, that's not a private good. That's a fascist good. That's literally taking money away from citizens, by force, to provide a service that they did not demand. That's so far from what is being discussed, it's laughable. I can further go into detail about the bad incentives involved in a public/private prison system, but that's not the discussion at hand.

>They're shocking. Have a look at privatized policing or defence. It's terrifying.

Really? Because it's fucking fantastic. Contractual obligations to protect you [(unlike now, where the police only have to protect you if they feel like it)]( http  insurance in case something happens, and all around good service. Do you have anything to back up your claims that private police (aka security, militias [such as Academi, which do the same job, if not better, for 1/3 the cost]) are bad, or are you just talking straight from your ass?

>And even when they are ""better"" (within one country), that's in part because they have crowded out public provision.

Complete fabrication, with no basis in reality.

>And wait again, even when they do get provided privately (and are of somewhat high quality), well, you're actually just not correct about costs always being lower. French and British medical costs per capita are far lower than American ones (which are the highest in the world). This is true of lots of other goods too.

In the USA, we do not have private medicine. If you think that, you're fucking stupid. That's really it. We have a fascist medicine model, where trillions of dollars are taken by force from private citizens, and thrown at doctors. This causes there to be artificial price floors on goods, and de facto causes the prices to rise. Also the insurance model that is currently adopted by most Americans de-incentivizes shopping around, so people just don't ask what things cost, and that further causes prices to increase. Also, the people not shopping around causes people without insurance to have a much harder time shopping around when they want to, because service providers are less prone to be upfront with the actual costs of services.

>Do yourself a favour and google ""market failures"". Then read some of the academic literature on public goods provision and inequality. A decent introductory text would be Wilkinson & Pickett's ""The Spirit Level"".

I've noticed you use the phrase ""you just don't like it"" a lot when talking to atheists about their rejection of god claims.

It's that I don't think they are true in any demonstrable way.

I would counter-argue that it is you that is basing what you believe on what you like or dislike. You like Christianity--maybe you were raised in it, or it offered a world view that appeals to you--but I would dare say that, in this discussion, your claims are far more dictated by what you would like to be true than mine.

That's not your call to make. Again, blunt talk here: religion is not for you, and that's fine, but your comments make me think you're being pretty condescending towards your wife for seeking consolation during a time when she's deeply distressed. 

By all means, please, sit down and talk to her about how you feel--how you don't identify as Catholic and you don't feel right participating in religious activities. (I'm not being sarcastic, I mean it.) But don't be shitty because she finds meaning and comfort in something you personally don't. "

Because it would be a lot of work to ferry around someone of no strategic value that you actively want dead.

>It's weird to ask ""why would you bring her"", she was there and with rickon, they're turning over rickon and his guardian, end of story.

Why is the guardian necessary? She's just some wildling, what value does she have to either the Umbers or the Bolton? It's not weird to ask why someone would invest that much effort into something that would directly oppose their interests.

>It makes 0 sense to give your lord over to a psychopath in the name of gaining trust. This theory is just dumb and the product of wishful thinking.

It makes perfect sense. When you give someone something of value it fosters trust. You can't just say ""please trust me. I won't swear my loyalty, and my family were known for being close to the people that you you killed, but you should totes trust me"". That's not how it works. Ramsay can't hurt Rickon without angering several northern houses, he's too valuable a hostage, and I doubt he has any interest in raping him. He is safe, albeit in am awful place. Giving them Rickon means they can convince the Boltons that they are aligned, without actually endangering Rickon.

>You say in your first paragraph ""Osha is of no value"" then shortly after ""without osha you don't gain their trust"" like what??

I didn't say anything about Osha being necessary for trust. I said the only reason you'd take her is to have someone in the inside. She's not highborn or the key to the North, so she's not a good political bargaining chip, that does not mean she has no value at all. Please actually read the point before getting all condescending.

>A captive osha is of no use to anyone. At all.

So why bring her? Why go through the effort of capturing her, containing her, feeding her, and giving her away? Why not just kill her on the spot? You don't put that much effort into things you have no use for, especially when they belong to a people you actively dislike.

Yes. I could say those things and I would be correct, though your condescending tone implies that you would rather keep an artist poor than give him ample compensation for his creation. If you have so little value for artists, why do you cling to what they create? Pure selfishness, I bet.

>When someone emits something, it is no longer under his control.

That's not true. The artist owns the work and how it can be distributed. It's basic copyright law. 

You are taking that control away from the artist as though you owned the work yourself, which you do not. You only own a copy. You can make an archive copy but you cannot allow others to make a copy without infringing on the artist's copyright. You don't own the copyright, the artist does. Geez...this is really elementary.

>When I communicate something to you, it becomes part of you. I can't revoke it, and you can do what you will with it. 

No you can't. That's why the debate still rages. Read the law, if you respect any laws at all.

">You've got a fraction of a fraction of a percentage chance of being killed by a migrant.

This isn't a simple issue that can be glossed over with words like ""fraction of a percentage chance"" whether you're talking about individual risk level or the far-reaching and long-lasting (many permanent) damaging effects on a society (or its economy/culture/laws/politics/freedom/million-other-things) in the event of a single terrorist attack - the world is a little more complicated than how you perceive it. Like I've said to you before, national security risk calculations and decisions are for Korea to decide.

>Do you have any evidence that there were terrorists in that group of Yemeni refugees?

No, and I'd rather Korea doesn't wait to find out or take the risk.

>What is it with you right-wing people and just bending and twisting the facts to suit your agenda?

I can say the same about open border advocates. And not wanting refugees doesn't automatically make you ""right wing"" - it's just ordinary citizens who are fearful for the safety and future of their children, their family and their loved ones. That's their ""agenda"", and if you're against that then it means you're for terrorizing peoples' families and their loved ones.

>And who says that without a blanket ban on asylum seekers you would be adding them to the list?

Again, Korea is a sovereign state and makes its own national security risk calculations and decisions.

>And sure anyone could point to one individual who was arrested and not give asylum

Not ""technically given asylum"", yet lived in Korea for over 10 years on a ""humanitarian visa"". Not arrested until almost 11 years of living in Korea.

>that's just cherry-picking one guy out of hundreds of people.

There's a difference between cherry-picking and supporting evidence. 

> It's just irrational, illogical, and frankly it's scaremongering to push an agenda.

Completely your opinion, and in my opinion your words are a baseless attempt to discredit facts you don't like. The only agenda that's being ""pushed"" is pro-refugee - the Korean media is being overwhelmingly sympathetic to the refugees and ordinary citizens are getting very, very angry about it - if anything it's having the opposite effect based on an updated opinion poll.

>I'm expecting society to keep it's word and not go back on international agreements that it's signed, like a true patriot.

Based on your condescending emotional appeal you underestimate Koreans' awareness and level of knowledge on this issue. Believe me, they are more than willing to trade some (even a lot of) international clout for domestic security.

And really, ruining their reputation? You talk like Korea committed genocide or something. Get some perspective.

>And how would that help? You can't just throw money into an active war-zone and expect that to be enough to encourage people to stay there. Would it be enough for you if it was your town that had been flattened by air strikes?

Not Korea's business.

You're the one being illogical - it took 10 years to catch him, not to mention there could be who-knows-how-many-more terrorists around. And don't you dare fucking downplay the risk - it's playing Russian roulette with Koreans' lives.

>I didn't realise that Korea was no longer a member of the human race.

Last time I checked, the world was divided into sovereign states. I'm sorry it's not a one-world government like you want.

>Are you going to allow a homeless Korean to live with you?

No, but I don't go around telling others to invite homeless Koreans into their homes either.

> The whole point of society is that we are able to pool our resources to achieve things we could never dream of achieving alone, to actually solve problems and not just create them.

If you don't like it, I'm sure there are some uncontacted tribes in the Indian ocean somewhere that would be delighted to have you.

Again, societies in the world are divided into sovereign states. I'm sorry it's not the borderless utopia you dream about. But keep dreaming.

">You didn't identify one time I deflected or rationalized anything.

You rationalized saying something incredibly condescending without regard for consequences by stating that your goals were much more narrow than it would be reasonable to assume. If you care about the environment, then you should want to be persuasive to people who aren't absolutely, unambiguously convinced of the same position, because their actions matter too (more, in fact, since they represent a much larger group of people). To state otherwise is a ridiculous, rationalized position. 

Sounding like a douche isn't great for being persuasive. I mean, let's be honest, we're not being very convincing to each other right now, are we? 

>that would be an attribution error.

The concept of fundamental attribution error (Mr. ""Don't throw psych terms in out of context"") isn't a flaw in my argument here, it supports it. The fact that it is common in human psychology to attribute behaviour to internal traits rather than external situations means that it's reasonable to assume that people will do so. And since I'm not arguing that environmentalists are assholes because you're an asshole, but that it will be perceived by a significant subset of people that environmentalists are assholes because you're an asshole, you haven't pointed out a flaw in my argument. It would be a flaw in their logic, but you're not arguing with their logic. Their logic exists beyond your capability to interfere with it. You can manipulate it from the outset, but can't question it later.

>people that apologize for them and insist I remain civil when they act like assholes, like you. 

I make no apologies for the person you responded to. He was probably not very bright.

I want people to do what people who are right say, and not have their point degraded because they aren't likeable.

>Again, its a symmetrical plane. The actual path it carves is a conical section. The dimensions of that section are a function of the time the ball spends intersecting that plane, and that is a function of the width of the plane, the diameter of the ball, and the speed of the ball. Nothing else is in that equation. The width of the plane does not change during the rotation. Nor does the size of the ball. The only thing that changes is the speed: it slows. As it slows, the corresponding size of the conical section it carves as it passes through the plane formed by the cylinder grows.


I'm not saying the area of space swept out by the ball changes when it's entering vs exiting. I'm saying the area of the cylinder's surface that intersects the ball's path changes based on the direction the ball travels due to the cylinder's rotation. If you label a circular cross section of the cylinder, you see the labels rotate and it is easier to see how this happens.

There is no contradiction. What you are experiencing is not understanding that there is legal difference between what you think and what is (that sounds so condescending, sorry).

> The first excerpt says it's prohibited for an employer to claim an employee's tip, even when over minimum wage. 

No. What it says is that an employer is prohibited from claiming any tip, except under two very specific circumstances: Tip credit and tip pooling. Since you never mentioned tip pooling we can dispense with addressing whether that is an issue, that leaves us with only determining if tip credit applies (it does).

Read the entire link, a few times. At first glance it does not make sense, I know it did not make sense to me the first few times.

> The second, my understanding is that it's only illegal if the deduction reduces me to below minimum wage. 

Yes. In your situation, because your employer takes a tip credit, any deduction would reduce your wage below minimum wage. 

Tips that you earn, except for that portion that tip credit and tip pooling applies, are yours, period. They cannot be used by your employer for any reason. 

Remove tips from the equation and it makes more sense. Your employer pays you minimum wage. Your employer then says that you must allow a deduction of $1 or $2 per shift for breakage. Since your employer pays you exactly minimum wage then any deduction reduces your wage below minimum wage.

> If I am still making over minimum wage, even with these deductions, is it still technically illegal? 

You are not ""making over minimum wage"". You are ""making"" exactly minimum wage. Any tips you earned over minimum wage are not used in calculating your minimum wage.

What most people do is confuse income and wage. They are different. Your income might be more than minimum wage, but your wage is exactly minimum wage. 

This is not an easy concept to explain, at least for me, in print. Hell it's difficult in person sometimes because you have to break/destroy concepts that the person believes they understand, and that can be difficult for some.

Get off your fucking condescending high horse mate and get a grip on reality. I never said you were delusional, and why are you ""asking me to be reasonable""? When you're just making silly unsubstantiated claims wildly, hoping to conjure up some debate or a rebuke to your point of view. You want a ""reasonable answer""? Well here's one.

Suarez, is aged 27, arguably one of the top three best players in the world right now if not the most in form next to Ronaldo at the moment. His Liverpool squad before the season weren't even being taken seriously as top four contenders, and now here we are and we find ourselves with what, six games to go? And Liverpool are top of the table with the second highest GD, most goals scored in the league, and Suarez is I believe two goals away from tying the all time scoring record in a season in the PL and three from breaking it?

Now surely this is all largely in due part to the fact that Liverpool are only still competing in one competition at this stage of the season, like Manchester City, and aren't in the CL like their title rivals Chelsea. And as a result, have less strain on their fixture list. But, regardless, it's still nonetheless impressive, especially as no one even imagine they'd be challenging for the title this year aside from maybe a minority of neutrals and Liverpool fans. 

Now, lets be reasonable here, with all those factors going for Suarez, what with the potential of the first league title for Liverpool in how long? As well as a chance at being able to achieve CL with the club that stood by him time and time again through his fucking antics? I think Suarez, as well as most of the club understands that the true achievement of this season for Liverpool is how much they've achieved with how little depth they added to the team over the course of the season. You better bet your ass John Henry and FSG will be ready like no other club this summer to reinforce and give BR the allocations he needs to take Liverpool back to the top.

I'm sorry mate, but I really think you're the one being unreasonable here. You're being completely ignorant towards the facts and completely disrespectful towards what Suarez and Liverpool have achieved this season."
" > your complete reliance on the english translation of a sacred text implies you have never spoken any other language in your entire life.

Wonderfully presumptive and condescending, but very wrong. I rely on those texts because that's the best resource I can get. I don't speak every language in the world, so I have to settle for checking multiple translations in English.

> The tafsir will give you much more context. If you choose not to,

Thank you, I will be interested to read those. In English. Unless you would rather I get a spanish translation.

> please remember people get PhDs and spend their lives researching these types of things; the mere ability to read the english language does not authorize you to pretend to understand or make any judgments on a 1400 year old religious text.

That is where I very strongly disagree with you. While there are thousands of people with PhDs who make judgements on this text, there are over a Billion and a half Muslims without PhDs who do make judgements on these texts, and the judgements they make influence the way they live their lives, and the way they live their lives influences global politics. Most Muslims in the world want peace and prosperity for their family and to just get along, like most people in the world. But some (talking about ISIS, Boko Haram, etc. here) want very different things, or have very different definitions for those things. Obviously, Western imperialism is a massive superstructure of a reason for the conflicts we experience now. But why does the resultant unrest take the form it does, and why is it so successful at creating individual cells through social media and persuasion? Those Islamist terrorists live their lives they way they do partly due to their interpretations of their holy texts (and indeed, most of those groups espouse a caliphate/lifestyle emulating as closely as possible the one created and ruled by Muhammad, and all their evidence comes from these holy texts), and most of them do not have PhDs, and yet they make judgements on those texts that influence the way they live their lives, and the way they live their lives influences global politics. 

I do not have a PhD, and I do not even have the cultural background to understand the texts as many non PhD Muslims do. But I do have a brain, and I can read, and I live in a world that is influenced by non-PhD people's interpretation of these texts, and those things do give me the right to try to understand what those texts mean in the world today, and to make judgements on them for my understanding.

Edit: and by the way, do you not notice how much the passages I provided sound like they are describing ISIS? There is a reason for that... Or do you want to claim that I'm just imagining that, since I read in English and don't have a PhD, and am therefore ""not authorized""?"

"Suppose I'll come back to this.

Yes, I realize I was incorrect in the way I worded it, but not in the way you are stating. In the example 0 (516), 0 is the amount of health recovered by the target, aka Healing. 516 is the amount of health recovered by the target but was over the health maximum, aka Overhealing. The 2 numbers combined is the amount restored. Another example would be 146 (78), 146 is the amount of health the target was missing resulting in 146 healing, 78 is the amount healed over the target's max health, resulting in 78 overhealing. The total amount restored is then 224 (146+78). How do I know this? I've been the main healer of many raiding groups in MMOs for many years and I'm able to read healing charts/meters like it's my first language.

As for 0, I of course know the meaning of it. ""0"" is a number and in addition, the additive identity allowing 0 + x = x to be true. By your comment however:
> Restoring 0 is restoring nothing.

It seems you don't know the meaning of ""zero"". 0 is not nothing, 0 is a number. Therefore the statement should be ""Restoring 0 is restoring 0"" which would trigger Elana.

Why compromise on a bill if it garners no votes?

>the challenging of presidential appointees during Obama's two terms

Obama has faced more opposition on this front than every other president ever, by a large margin. That's just...astounding and unbelievably anti-American and in poor faith. The Republican party should be ashamed of itself for this.

>It happens on both sides of the aisle. 

The country has become increasingly polarized over the course of the last 40 years. Research indicates that this polarization is largely due to the Republican party shifting further to the right, so you are wrong to imply that there is an equal level of gamesmanship/opposition from each party.

Relevant quote: 

>The evidence points to a major partisan asymmetry in polarization. Despite the widespread belief that both parties have moved to the extremes, the movement of the Republican Party to the right accounts for most of the divergence between the two parties. Since the 1970s, each new cohort of Republican legislators has taken conservative positions on legislation than the cohorts before them. That is not true of Democratic legislators. Any movement to the left by the Democrats can be accounted for by a decline in white representatives from the South and an increase in African-American and Latino representation.

The study I linked goes into that a bit, though unsatisfyingly so:

>Some commentators suggest that time spent using each mode would be the most appropriate denominator.9 Such data are rarely collected, but rates based on a trip denominator would provide an inter-modal comparison similar to a time denominator, since trips by each mode are more comparable in time than in distance.

Ok, you have a point here, though you didn't actually cite anything so far, only referenced. Not that's necessarily a bad thing for most discussions like this, but might help. 

The problem is your original questions, and many like them, aren't easily answered with (as far as I know) what information we have so far, so we have to find evidence for theories. What this means is that the answers are up for some interpretation and therefore are much less black-and-white as you suggest. Citing or referencing something is not going to help if they other person interprets that part completely differently. 

As for the actual discussion of this thread, I think the belief argument is not as strong though may still play a part in at least some cases. I think that the belief of others on a mass scale plays a large part, but also the belief of the person can play a part like we see with Kaladin's brands. I imagine very few people still consider him a slave after he is publicly a Radiant yet he still has the shash brand. I think Connection or belief might play a part in the Vivenna situation you referenced, though other things are at play with Kelsier's Hazekiller fight. I'm guessing it probably has more to do with some specifics. For instance, Kelsier might be able to pull on a metal sword he used to stab someone, though probably won't if it went all the way through them. That sort of thing. But, again these questions don't have any concrete answers as far as we know right now so it might be hard to pin it down for sure. 

I agree, you shouldn't believe something solely because a bunch of other people do.

> the oolotic kidney would likely require a dedicated arterial channel able to intercept the flow of both renal arteries and channel it through the organ and directly into one of the major posterior arteries. There, question answered.

These kinds of details are useful, but they raise many questions as a result. What does this sort of information mean? What other physiological changes must occur in order for a Space Marine to be a Space Marine? How do those changes occur? Simply stating that this is a little thicker or that does what it says it does in the Lexicanum, that's not helpful nor particularly challenging. 

>You asserted that it would be possible, under a hormone-dependent form of Astartes transformation process...for present-day humanity to create something similar.

I most certainly did not. I only briefly mentioned the modern understanding of science, in general; beyond that it's all 40k. 

>Hormones can lead to structural changes. This is what you are failing to grasp. Your view of hormones is actually surprisingly limited for someone who claims to have a higher level of scientific understanding then me.

I fully understand that. I get the feeling that you're skimming my arguments, especially based on your response later in your post acknowledging muscle attachments, etc. I never claimed to have a higher level of scientific understanding than you. I might; who knows? Frankly, I don't care. Talk about petty. My arguments don't care about your fascination with growth hormones (I don't get why you're hammering that particular nail so hard; it's in already; it's fine; we seem to be in general agreement about what we think hormones could be doing in Space Marines, from what I gather from your post in its entirety). That's the reason I chose those few specific, general, examples, to highlight areas that aren't easily explained by alien organ implants and advanced hormone regulation. We could hand wave them away and say super magical hormones. I am willing to admit that's a possibility (unlikely, but possible). But as I've stated, it's a clunky solution; it raises too many red flags: if they have those kinds of capabilities, why bother with all the other nonsense if you can brute force genetics in such a manner (this is part of my reasoning before I read your most recent response, the one I'm replying to here, as you seemed to dismiss the genetic components; I don't think we're very far away from one another as of right now on the subject)? Similar to the Oolitic kidney example, there is more than meets the eye at work that makes the outcome possible. 

>Hormones, programmed in, reacting with genetic material predisposed for a certain growth patter, will grow the joints in a different pattern.

I completely disagree with this assessment. Nothing about joints would allow for the extreme abuse an Astartes would inflict upon them. No structural changes would allow for that, and the material composition would have to change dramatically in order to compensate (to the point where I might suspect a synthetic origin). Nothing on earth does anything similar to what a Space Marine does, in that regard. 

>You disagree with my assessment of the betchers gland? How so? The glands produce a metal-corrosive venom.

In novels, I've seen it described as very mildly corrosive (some authors go a little crazy, to be fair). It takes hours upon hours to chew through rubber insulation and longer for metal. The venom part is what makes it a potent weapon. It's mainly designed for digestive purposes, though; it would make that function pretty difficult if it was a particularly nasty, face melting acid, not to mention horribly dangerous and stupidly designed. Also, given the location of the glands, I very much doubt it could create ""a flying arrow of acid""; they probably just hock a loogie. It's not nearly as glamorous, but it gets the job done.

My 'agenda' is to help guys find partners, and to know that part of that is treating women right. Part of that is understanding women, how they think, and the things they have to deal with, so they do better with more succes. This is absolutely not unrelated to seduction, or /r/seduction. it's quite simply having more empathy for people who are different (in this case, women). that is a good thing. treating a woman as an equal, instead of a thing to take, is absolutely the pervue of any attraction process and should always be encouraged. tell me how that is wrong.

those concepts listed are weighted and skewed to be pro-woman (I'm not entirely a fan of them either, but they are what they are), but if you can't have a conversation about them without coming off sexist, you should improve your communication skills and choose better words. it's really not that hard. 

The problem here is that you are not even arguing or debating the points I (and others) brought up, but flatly dismissing issues that women do deal with, which means you're perpetuating the douchebag 'male oppressor' stereotype.

Those are only four issues off the top of my head, ones I've dealt with personally, but I'm sure there are more.

>But they're not saying that - I just pointed out that they're protected in their ability to say that. And they're not alone. Apple, Blizzard, Riot - check em - you'll find a very similar set of terms and most people are so eager to play the game (and terribly impatient) that they can't be bothered to read them.

>Yet, you agreed to them - your ignorance of what you agreed to is does not excuse you from any consequences that arise from that ignorance. 

Once again, I didn't disagree with that I merely said it was a shitty way to do business. Once again, I can't figure out why you felt the need to type all those words for absolutely no effect. 

>Unfounded hyperbole based on rumor and myth. Facts: people were banned, reasons were given, false flags happened, bans reviewed, accounts slowly being unbanned. Anything else you add to that is speculation and has ZERO factual basis. That's what I take issue with - the hyperbole and nonsense. 

Completely fact-based? No, I'll admit to that. Hyperbole? Get the fuck out of here. How new are you to this subreddit or this game? Gumi is notorious for having honestly terrible customer support and just generally not giving a crap. A few anecdotal success stories pop up or they give people some nice consolation prizes as ""compensation"" for some snafu and suddenly perception shifts and everyone has their heads up Gumi's butt again. That's the ridiculous hyperbolical baloney here; the perception that Gumi is somehow reasonable or nice or good to any of us in any type of sincere way. It's rampant on this subreddit and I get berrated for my divergent view all the time but you just simply won't convince me that there is any merit to Gumi's existence; I would trade all my global units and every Gem Gumi's ever given me for a well-translated version of BFJP run by Alim. 

>Then you're not seeing the big picture. Lack of experience will lead to that. 

Lack of experience? Listen you condescending, sanctimonious shit; because I'm about to explain why you're full of grade-A Balogna. 


>The bans are an attempt to protect the investments of spenders and free players - so that they perceive and realize value out of accumulated or purchased in-game currency. 

So far so good, that's a reasonable assumption. It's wrong but it's reasonable. The bans are in response to people avoiding paying gumi to get their rank up. Protection of investments indeed, but not the players'. If you're cheating at these money-draws then you're not spending loads of cash on Gems so that you can legally cheat your way to the top and Gumi doesn't like that. The gemming itself is what makes these events stupid to begin with. It's a ridiculous hypocricy to call these ""competitions"" when, in fact, they're actually more or less penny auctions where Gems are the bids. 

>If hackers/cheaters are able to escape punishment, then that devalues the in-game currency and the desire to purchase it for use (why bother if hackers can achieve those results faster and without spending?) Because it undermines their business model: it's not just about the 100 or so cheaters in each FH, it's about the disenfranchised players who see cheaters trumping their hard work and decide that there's no longer any value in purchasing in-game currency. Or playing...etc. 

1. I specifically offered an alternative punishment that mitigates that issue without prejudicial banning: Simply strip cheater's ranks and rewards and fill the gaps with all the non-cheaters. The ""disenfranchised"" players get a fair competition and the cheaters don't benefit. 

2. As I specifically stated, the effect of hackers is so sly that only the top-paying players could possibly noticed if they were having problems and thus feel ""disenfranchised."" And while we're on the subject of Hyperbole, calling a fat bank account ""hard work"" is pretty much laughable. I had no trouble winning matches in the Vortex Arena or getting 2+ Million points in Frontier Hunter; the only thing that kept me out of the highest ranks was my refusal to rinse and repeat the process ad infinitum by purchasing and using gems. 

I had some sympathy for you but I can see why you're getting shot down by other users. 

But here's the TL;DR of my opinion that really matters and if you reply to anything, read this first and reply to this point at the very least:
----

Ban first, compensate later is a stupid and ridiculous tactic for dealing with cheaters. You want to talk about disenfranchising players? That's how you do it. I don't even agree with banning people who do cheat on events without giving them at least one shot with a warning and resetting their event rewards and removing their rank. It seems like just as much work as banning and then subsequently unbanning and compensating people and it's less aggressive.

Gumi does have a track-record of providing mediocre support and not getting back to people when they get suspensions or have other similar problems. Thanks to the Terms (Which are not atypical by any means) no one is entitled to anything but that doesn't mean that the way that Gumi deals with support issues and account suspensions is good for customer relations. And that's my point; even if Gumi is justified and right and not entirely unreasonable, it's just not a very good way to deal with people (and if you don't believe me look at the responses in this very subreddit; the general attitude is pretty negative towards Gumi).

"> i still hope you one day realise truth

You realize how condescending it is when talking to someone about their own life, and relationship ?

And there you are talking about insults.

"It doesn't have to be a simple number. But for any theory that claims something is ""too high"", there needs to be some sort of threshold defined in that same theory which is considered acceptable. And the threshold needs to be justified in that same theory. Otherwise, the entire notion of something being too high makes no sense.

Never said that means a study is ""bunk"", just said that it's not very conclusive, and if anything is correlative, and I'm sure we all know about the pitfalls of correlative relationships.

As for the studies, the first one is quite interesting, but applies to diabetics mainly. The second study isn't really relevant to nutrition, or 99% of the population as it has to do with the effect on dentures. The third study was very interesting, I wish the sample size was larger, but very interesting nonetheless, I'd like to see more on that. That last two studies were also interesting, but again pertain to diabetics mainly. 

I stand corrected, there is some scientific basis for the health benefits of apple cider vinegar, I hope to see more research on it in the future. Thanks for bringing those studies to my attention. "
"I'll pitch in a thought:

Some folks, Wu among them, have taken so much shit from so many avenues that people in many places treat them very daintily. It's like knee-jerk lionizing sainthood. You've suffered so much that your opinions and feelings take on an aura of extra legitimacy. Given that I am not psychic, I don't know if anyone exploits this. But, regardless, I see comments made by a lot of folks in this type of situation that are questionable or really dumb and deflective but are given a pass because of who they are. At least, that is how I believe things are coming to pass.

The danger of being a persona/mini-celeb is that some folks will lose sight that you're also just a person with the same features and failings you had before. 

So, some folks will take issue with people for the opposite knee-jerk reason. They may not even understand why mentions of Wu get their hackles up, but they do.

>It's all about Ghazi isn't it? 

This is just condescending. True or false, it's a small attack and even if people are being shitty nobody likes being called out. I'd like to think the average level of discourse here is a little higher than elsewhere, but that could just be my bias talking.

I'd also like people to respond rather than downvote as well. I think downvoting is better a function of ""does this add to the discussion"" rather than ""I don't like your post or it hurts my feels"""
"Maybe you should learn to read things in context and not get your knickers in a twist over nothing. Please save your phony outrage for someone who cares.

Quite. Quite. We can spew rhetoric and remind everyone that you missed the point for a moment of pedantic pleasure, ore we can get back on topic.

>Would you say the same for someone with a depiction of someone pissing on a cross?

We aren't talking about crosses, but now you are. You were hoping that comment about my lack of wit would give you enough plastic moral high ground to just change the subject. However, yes, it is not required that I participate in your delusions, and if I feel that I have a responsibility to subvert it's reliance on icons to drive fear and respect into people, then, yes, you bet your sweet condescending tits, that I believe anyone is free to subvert the divinity of ANY icon. I'm sorry that you wish our culture were more incestuous. I do not think this even comes close to verging on any boundaries of free speech. A religious icon is a marketing device for an ideology and I do not believe any ideology has any sort of monopolistic right to being beyond reproach and I do not think any ideology should come to dominate because of some preconceived idea that it's antisocial to dissent.

Basically, yellow ribbons, Jesus fish, crosses, etc. give people a completely baseless material item of recognition from which to draw self-righteousness, even if their actions are a contradiction to what the icon stands for. Everyone is entitled to their ideas and values, but my point is that the icon has come to mean more than the religion itself. It takes a certain kind of non-Christian Christian to not turn the other cheek right? They are more than willing to mouth off all over their cars, facebook, or any other place they can become a spectacle, but if someone else does it, it's completely unacceptable and they feel entitled to commit an act of polarizing antisocial destruction.

There IS no moral reason to victimize someone for expressing their beliefs, no matter how offensive you may find them."

No need to be condescending, first of all. Are you really presuming to know my worldview? Let's not get all ad hominem up in here.

>There is a whole spectrum, from violent rape, rape of someone that is unconscious, threatening to fire someone if he or she doesn't agree to sex, threatening to break up with someone if he doesn't agree to have sex, crying for not getting sex, sulking for not getting sex.

I'm glad you seem to realize that there is a wide spectrum of what constitutes rape. But why bring it up? As woman and feminist, I daresay I'm particularly attuned to the reality of rape in its varied forms. Why can't this list include the rape of someone who's too drunk to make a meaningful decision? 

Honest question: Why are you so reluctant to focus on the idea of consent on both parties actually, genuinely wanting sex? I know that having to ""make sure"" a girl (or guy) wants to fuck will mean you might get turned down a little more often. But it also means you won't be a rapist! (impersonal 'you')"
">And yet you do not entertain the idea that the Bible is simply fallible and not the direct word of God.

No one said it was the direct word of God, for starters. It was written by people who had incredibly high renown for their position as honest leaders in the early church. They mention that these revelations were inspired by God, which is not a validation but a claim that gives us more capacity to scrutinize their texts. Namely, if it is inspired by God then it wouldn't contradict other inspired texts, so we can easily discern when false claims are made. 

Fallible? What does this have to do with anything the thread is about? Do you mean textual fallibility or moral fallibility? Are you trying to assert that the Bible is not the place to go to glean truth from? Just claiming that it's fallible really doesn't mean anything in and of itself. I don't know what you are implying by saying it.

>if that is not the case, and you feel you've arrived at the conclusion that such an assumption is correct, then please illuminate how you've done so.

What assumption are you referring to? The one I answered above? If so, then above. If not then please explain.

>It is not a strawman argument, as it was not intended to misrepresent your argument. I made a comment about what I suspected your thought process was, a comment intended to prompt you to question it and respond. 

Well, wouldn't it be easier to just ask my position than make up a position and attribute it to me in hopes that I explain myself? Seems underhanded.

>No, I'm not. I've met many religious people who don't do this, but I have noticed that they tend to have much more abstract views of the Divine, and tend not to adhere to any doctrinal viewpoint. 

Without solid core doctrine you may as well invent your own religion. I meet tons of religious folk who aren't Christians. I don't see how that applies here.

>You don't know me, and haven't witnessed me label other people as such elsewhere, so on what basis are you making this assertion?

By the way you have made grand blanketing statements of the faith so casually.

>While some of your thoughts/arguments have been logical, they all seem to terminate as soon as they get too messy/conflicting

Where?

>and you seem to fall back on the idea that that just means God's intent is really complex, and more investigation is needed to uncover his true meaning. 

And... this is different from the scientific method... how? And on which subject?

>Why can't the messy conflicts be due to the reasons I've proposed? 

What reason? That the bible is ""fallible""? Well, even if I were to assume it was fallible (capable of mistakes or errors) that doesn't mean it is full of mistakes or errors. If you think there is a mistake or error I would love to see it. Likewise, I can understand if you are referring to errors of translation, which have happened and me be the case when it comes to abomination and Paul's use of homosexual--but this isn't an example of the word having a mistake or being in error. It's a translation error that is easily solved by going to a previous text and re-examining the word use in the original language.

>This is what makes it seem like you're assuming God and the accuracy of the Bible, because you seem unwilling to entertain the idea that the Bible is full of contractions, because it was written by human beings, not God. If that's the case, please explain how you know that.

I already addressed the difference between God-Written and God-Inspired and how it's not a validation, but a way to scrutinize the claims of other potential texts. 

What contradictions? What's your favorite one? I'm completely willing to entertain the idea it does have them, but it simple doesn't. Find me one, I'll explain it using all the same methods we use to discern meaning from any other text, ancient or otherwise. Context, historical understanding, setting, audience, authorial intent, direct literal translations, etc. 

Heck, it seems to me you are trying really hard to assert that the Bible is fallible and try to use that idea to argue... what exactly? I don't even understand why you are trying to claim such a thing. Especially because even if you claim it's fallible and I agree with you, that doesn't mean the Bible actually is in error. It just means it could be. We'd still need to do the exact same research in this specific case to come to any kind of conclusion. So really, I don't have a clue what you are trying to do.

>The point of me asking you to clarify your assumptions and why you assume them above is to clear up the ground the discussion is based on, and make sure we're not wasting time debating particulars, when we don't actually agree on the basics. 

Then ask me to clarify. I'm perfectly fine with that. Insofar, though, you've scrutinized my rationale, my capacity to be objective, my ability to properly research, and, well, pretty much everything under the sun. Obviously I don't mind scrutiny as I am always prepared to give an answer (why I'm still talking), but those examples I listed aren't asking me to explain my position, they are simply assuming a lack of my faculties due to my faith (by your definition of it). 

So, if your intent is to get some clear understanding of my position so we can have common ground from which to build a strong argument, then let's do that. But let's do it without these games. Ask clearly what my position is on something before making an assertion, and I'll do the same.

>But more to the point, I have no interest in having an argument here. I only enjoy discussions. I'm sorry if my assertion that you weren't thinking logically pissed you off, but that is honestly the impression I've gotten from your arguments, and if you can't accept that and try to approach our disagreement with civility, rather than getting defensive and argumentative, then I have no interest in continuing this thread. I think these are all reasonable requests. If you agree, please try to accommodate them.

This is, honestly, a laugh. You seem to have a vague understanding of civility if you can call me illogical with one side of your mouth then claim to be the civil one here. Should I go through each of your posts and show you exactly where you did not simply discuss, but also attacked my intelligence in a condescending and patronizing way? This is so hypocritical that I'd be laughing hysterically right now if I thought for a moment you were just trollin' and that you, in fact, don't see your own error--and then acting claiming the moral high road? Geezy.

So, let's take a step back then. You called out my intelligence, obviously I disagree. Insofar I've found you highly illogical as you've made several faulty assumptions of my position, how you've attacked and condescended yet claim moral high-ground, and how you seem to really not have an opinion on the subject beyond your assertion that the Bible is fallible without any proof of such things, and even if it was we'd still need research this particular subject to see if this particular subject is also flawed.

State to me plainly your position on these things so I can understand exactly what position you have. And feel free to ask me the same, but I'll give you the same request: let's keep this civil, alright?

>But you never defined what faith is explicitly, so I don't see what basis you're claiming a disagreement with me. I'm sure you do disagree, but you haven't properly articulated your opposing view yet, so please do so.

You're talking to a random civilian. The ""What do you propose we do?"" was said in context of resistance within Russia against the regime and your suggestion is to return Crimea to Ukraine?

The USSR did win the war against Nazi Germany. Millions died and suffered for that cause. The average soldier in that war was just as much of a miserable prick with as much choice as any other soldier in any other war. You're mixing that together with glorifying Stalin and the USSR as a whole. Admittedly, some people do that but these things are different things.

>You see I wrote this message in few minutes, why can't Russians come up with and implement some decent plan at least like the one that I described?

I have a really hard time even thinking of an explanation for how condescending this is.

Why didn't Germans in Nazi Germany come up with some decent plan like giving back the Sudetenland? There was no point to even try to justify this act of annexation.

Why didn't Estonians dissolute their government before 1987 and elect a new one if they really didn't like it?

"> they are willingly assholes for no actual benefit to themselves

I mean, the idea that they're being assholes at all is kind of borderline, and the idea that they're doing this out of no actual benefit to themselves is unsubstantiated. (You think not a single one of those people has a chance of resubbing to WoW when their free alternative is over? This is factually wrong; I know someone who is.) I find your ethics very suspect if you think Blizzard is morally wrong shutting a literal clone of one of their products that uses all of their assets. It's completely irrelevant whether they made a profit with it.

People are only acting like Blizzard's being shitty because it's a David v Goliath situation, where big bad Blizzard is taking out the charitable little guys who are just giving the public what it wants. What if it was EA doing this? EA just decides it'd be a cool thing to do to spend thousands of dollars hosting free private WoW servers from previous patches for everyone who wants them. Would you be saying the same thing if another big bad company completely ripped off another company's game in broad daylight and offered it for free?

Or how about this; there's a game called Duelyst made by a small startup that recently made a change, during beta, that in my opinion ruins the game. There's no way to play the game now with the old rules, which I considered vastly superior. So if I started up an alternate Duelyst server, ripped off all of their assets and mechanics, and offered the game for free, you're telling me it'd be morally shitty for them to shut me down? Studios should be allowed to patch their game without worrying that ""fans"" are going to swoop in and use it as justification for copytheft.

And the guy you responded to was smug, but your post's tone is about 10x more smug regardless of correctly pointing out that they don't need worry about their IP.

You're clearly confusing ""rational"" with something else here. Having deep belief in certain political principles, no matter where they lead, perhaps?

> They did not require to have a political state. They were still a people with a homeland that they had lived in for generations. 

I'm not sure what you mean by that. The whole point we're talking about is a ""political state"". If we're merely talking about people living in a place, then they could continue to live as Israeli citizens, just as they lived for centuries as Ottoman subjects. 

They wanted a political state, they never had one, and the British were willing to give them one. They could've gotten angry at that proposal, because ""who the hell put the British in charge of our land?!"" (answer: without them you'd still be Ottoman subjects), but if that was the argument, it wouldn't be a rational decision. It would be an emotional one.

The funny thing is that you're actually portraying the Arabs as less rational than they actually were. Truth is, they fully expected the Jews to be crushed under the collective might of the Arab states, and had several good reasons to assume that. It wasn't really an ""irrational"" decision in the sense of a purely emotional one (as the one you're trying to portray), but merely not a very good one.

> The Jews had, I believe, 7 percent of the land at the time. The proposed agreement was obviously in their favor

Couple of things

1. As I said, you seem to confuse land ownership with political control. If the Arabs accepted the partition plan instead of starting a war, land ownership would not change at all. They'd still own their lands, they'd just be citizens of Israel rather than of Palestine. 

2. The ""7%"" is misleading. The majority of the land in Israel+Palestine is covered by a barren desert, the Negev. It was overwhlemingly empty, unfit for most purposes, and most importantly, state-owned. The ""half"" the Jews got is mostly that desert, along with a thin strip of land on the coastal region and in the Eastern Galilee. That's how the proposed Jewish state, even with that ""7%"", and the 1:2 ratio of Jews to Muslims in 1940's Palestine, would still have a Jewish majority. 

1. Like the Arabs, the Jews believed all of the land is theirs by right. Every single inch. So getting a few coastal cities and some barren desert (again, the vast majority of the future Jewish state), while not getting important Jewish centers like Hebron, or even Jerusalem, was absolutely not considered a great deal. I keep telling you: you seem to assume that the Jews secretly understood that they don't deserve the land, but that's just nonsense.

2. Finally, the Arabs didn't reject it because it was a ""bad deal"", so this whole argument is kinda bogus. Not a single Arab leader said that they'd accept it, if only the Jews got 40%, 30% or even 10%. The reasoning was quite different: no Jewish state, of any size, on Arab lands, period. 

> I'm asking about the choice of the Palestinians. Why would they have left? 

... left? Who was talking about about anyone leaving? Some would just become Israeli citizens, that's all. Those who did end up becoming Israeli citizens, seem to like it very much. They reject even the implication to swap their citizenship for a Palestinian one as ""racist"".

Now, assuming that was a typo, and you meant to say ""what would they have left""? They'd have their first chance in history to rule over themselves. Not by the British, not by the Ottomans - and not by the Jordanians or Egyptians either. And they basically threw that chance away.

> Why were they supposed to bear the burden of european antisemitism? 

I didn't answer that question, because it's a clear loaded question. I assumed you're merely using as a rhetorical slogan, because that's what it is. If you want an answer: the assumption that they were ""paying for European antisemitism"" is wrong. 

First of all, they weren't ""paying"" anything. They had the chance to get something for free: their first own state in history. If you were a Palestinian Arab, you had two options. The best case scenario is that you become a citizen of your first Palestinian Arab state ever. The worst(?) case, is that you remain a subject of a non-Arab state, but this time, with full civil rights and access to the economic powerhouse that the Jews created. Either way, both options were far better than what the Palestinian Arabs had before. So portraying this as a ""price"" that they had to ""pay"" is ridiculous. 

Second, although Zionism was affected by European antisemitism, it wasn't even remotely the only driving force behind it. It was mostly affected by 19th-century national liberation movements. Just like, surprise surprise, Arab nationalism. And the Europeans weren't just trying to find a place for Jews to escape antisemitism either. It was a huge nation-building exercise that created essentially all the countries in the Middle East. They literally broke up an empire, and divvied it up between its original inhabitants. And in Israel's case (whether you agree with that or not), they decided it includes the Jews."
">And because they could not run the ball, because our run defense/front 7 was always good. But our secondary and pass rush were absolutely terrible. But I probably shouldn't mention our good front 7 since I'm just trying to make Brady (1 of the best QBs of all time) seem better than he actually is.

Uh, yeah. So you understand that the high number of passing yards given up has more to do with the rest of the defense being solid and the Pats offense scoring a lot than it does to do with their defense being historically bad? Good job!


>Yes I do know that! Isn't that crazy! Did you know that you seem to be the only person that follows football that does not think the Patriots secondary and pass defense has been atrocious?

Really, has it? You state this so condescendingly, and yet you are so wrong about it. In the last 12 years, Brady has had on average an above average pass defense by passer rating allowed. In fact, since 2002 the Pats have only had a bottom ten pass defense twice. This past year, they were top-10 by passer rating. Really atrocious huh? So I guess the rest of the football world is uninformed then, huh? And you are just another Pats fan who doesn't know shit about his own team?

>You mean to tell me that the 3 Super Bowl teams were based around the defense??? No.fucking.way.
Do you honestly believe that they have made 3 straight championship games because of the defense? Or are we not considering that successful?

Just saying, you suck at conveying sarcasm because I have no idea where you are being sarcastic here. Are you denying that the NE defense was the primary reason for their super bowl wins? Because Brady was basically a game manager for that period of time.

>If you don't want to be called a retard (which I didn't), you should probably work on your reading comprehension. Now if you could show me where I said anything about not wanting to be downvoted, and where I called you retarded that would be awesome.

>Awesome, but technically speaking they weren't wrong, sooo there's that... And the only reason I used that phrase wasn't to state my belief that I think they were the 2nd worst pass defense. It was to get you to remember a time in the Patriots life when they had a terrible secondary. A time, mind you, when they faced the 49ers.


Nice, you totally played that off like you knew that, and yet you still made the mistake of equating yards given up with how bad a secondary is. Once again, efficiency-wise, they were not even close to even being be worst secondary that year, let alone all time. Since you don't seem to understand that simple fact, let me rephrase. Do you think Matthew Stafford is the greatest qb of all time because he averages the most yards per game? Do you think that a hypothetical run defense that gives up the most running yards/game but only allows 3.5 ypc (league average is 4+) would be the worst run defense? If you think either of those is not true, then congrats, you're slowly learning that efficiency is more relevant than volume.

It's very rare for a reddit thread to provide enough information that you can know this is the case without jumping to conclusions. Asking ""what are some classes that would be in a Western hack of D&D"" doesn't imply that person has never considered the possibility of a classless game and it's kind of condescending to assume it does.

An unambiguous example would be, like, ""I'm developing a Western RPG, what should be the alignment requirements for a Sheriff?"""

"> People from good family backgrounds and resources can recover from self-destructive behavior, or posses the skills to deal with temptation, that others need rules and ritual to deal with.

This is basically the same condescending logic that led to a lot of sexist, racist, homophobic mistakes in the western world. The idea that The Right Kind Of People possess the moral and/or intellectual capacity to be worthy of having the freedom to choose for themselves. Meanwhile, those lesser beings really just need to be given rules and boundaries.... for their own good of course!

By an amazing coincidence, it's always The Right Kind Of People who get to choose what the rules and boundaries are, despite the fact that they themselves are not in any way affected by them.

>We need to stop this divisive nonsense... You want to unite humanity? Get people to view the world in that context, and you will.

While humanism is great in the abstract, applying it to real-life situations does more harm than good. Try telling your boss that you didn't get this quarter's target goal because at the end of the day it's all meaningless and see how that works out. 

Being blind to anything because YOU deem it unimportant is about the least humanist thing I can think of. Not to mention the fact that ALL humans are biased and act in subconscious ways to discriminate against others based on shared or opposing identities. Just naturally you are going to have much more affiliation and preference for someone who agrees with your humanist philosophy and interest in space travel relative to someone who disagrees with everything you say.


Everything is meaningless including science at the end of the day so why does your interest override real and current disproportionate agony and suffering? 

Human suffering and discrimination of certain groups is absolutely the FIRST thing we should should target in a meaningless ""speck of dust"". Avoidance of pain and suffering is the only thing that is universal goal for ALL in this meaningless existence. 


> I'm not saying that these topics are not important, but we so often get soaked in this quagmire of identity politics and racial divides that it eats into discussion about larger, all encompassing topics. 

Arguing that CLEAR current suffering and discrimination that occurs on the planet should not be a focus , because it's all meaningless in the grand scale is reductionistic and quite frankly condescendingly self-righteous.


>I'm trying to talk about larger issues that involve all of humanity, rather than specific demographics. 

And that's the exact problem. Minority groups always have their wants, goals, and desires fall second to others because of the greater good.

 http 


Let's imagine we ignore all the issues of minority groups, the poor, suffering, starvation and basically everything else in order to pursue some distant idea of searching the stars. Let's assume we knew 100% that we discover ways to leave the planet if it can't support us.

So we should put those goals on the back burner because there's a distant (and small )possibility it will pay off?

We've already seen this countless times in human history when we discover something for the public good.

Who do I you think is not going to get to afford to get on that ship to a new bountiful life. Who do you think is going to get all these supposed advantages "" for mankind""?

The same people people who want to ignore the suffering of minority groups. It's easy to be a humanist who is above these categorizations when your ""arbitrary group"" is going to be the one that reaps all the rewards of progress while current suffering is ignored. 

At the end of the day, space exploration is a very western/European goal that is equally meaningless as anything else. Why should minority groups such as gays, blacks, and Muslims put their own suffering second to a group that would never do the same for them?

Being blind to color/identity is tantamount is to being blind to the very things that give us meaning and the ways we organize our beliefs about the world (and beyond). Identity is how people make meaning, define themselves, and set goals. To ignore or dismiss the importance identity is to dismiss the very foundation of humanity itself. The meaning we make of existence and how we define ourselves.

Your only claim for this is your own assertion of it. In Christianity, there is a deposit of faith of scripture and interpretation that has been preserved very faithfully over the centuries. If you're trying to argue from within Christianity, this is what you have to work with. You can't just create your own interpretations based on personal opinion without harmonising it with that. The Bible has remained the same, as well as the beliefs surrounding it that have been transmitted. Doctrinal evolution is a flat-out heresy."

>How did I not address it directly? In fact, how could I even address them more directly? What have I spun? I don't see what information they would be giving me, I was naturally already aware of the reactions I had gotten here, I'm the one who responds to them. Them claiming that I'm the common denominator isn't information, it's their interpretation, to which I gave my counter. I provided them factual information, which is that the replies I get rarely have a connection to my actual words, people project and make up slanderous lies about me, so, if you were to look at the content this would become obvious. So why would me stating this fact be attacking?

We may just have to agree to disagree on this one. Someone pointing out that you are the common denominator IS information. Of all the conversations that you're getting negative reactions from, YOU are in all of them. Despite the fact that you may say, ""People don't listen for my content and that is the common denominator"" you are still the common denominator. Perchance you are not delivering information in a way that people can hear? I would say that there is definitely room for growth in the area. Nevertheless, you are the only fixed entity in all of the conversations.

You could have addressed it more directly by asking non-defensive questions such as ""What do you think it is that makes people respond to me like that?"". Such a question is designed to elicit information that is actually useful for your growth and understanding. Instead, the question you asked was a deflection about what other people do wrong.

I asked them ""What bias would I have?"" Seems like I'm engaging them directly on their claim which you accuse me of missing. Do you disagree?
Where would the condescension have been?

In the quote of yours I gave (in my first post), sentence 1 is an evasive maneuver not actually intended to move the conversation forward. Line 2 is the same, though shrouded in a legit question. Line 3 is your legitimate question which may have been answered had you not surrounded it by so many extraneous things. Last sentence is defensive at best and doesn't indicate a willingness to move toward understanding but shows that you're more interested in taking a combative stance with the other person.

I invite you to expand on your thoughts here. Currently it's not making any sense to me.
Also, calling the degree useless wasn't me making a personal attack, it was me expressing my general view about it since people claim I should have one to participate.

Irony at its finest. Your initial post was based in anecdotal evidence and as someone focused on evidence -- one example does not a sample-set make. You're not even speaking to their argument (or mine, for that matter). You step backward to hinge on some sort of empirical proof standard that others are held to but you aren't yourself. Calling the degree useless IS an attack whether you want to hear that or not -- you're specifically coming into a group of people that has been formed and BUILT AROUND THAT DEGREE. The specific scope of r/psychotherapy is for practicioners (who have degrees or are in school working toward them). That degree is highly relevant to our group.

">That labor contract laws are more well defined in Europe doesn't necessarily have any relation to the rate of economic growth. 

Right, but this isn't about how ""well-defined"" a labor contract is in Europe -- it's about the balance of power being on the employee's side in said contract, and the effect that that inevitably has on hiring practices. All I'm telling you is something that hundreds of economists on both sides of the Atlantic have observed over the last few decades. Reducing the bargaining power of the employee in employment/union contracts in Europe was a very common suggestion on the part of economists when consulted on the subject of improving lagging or weak European economies. 

It isn't about screwing employees over -- it's about more evenly distributing the power in the employer/employee relationship. Right now it's almost entirely on the side of the employee under the laws we describe, and that has an unfortunate effect on the economy as a whole. It privileges existing employees over potential ones, and unfortunately potential employees describes the entirety of the youth population.

>Reasons why the US might have had a higher rate of growth than Europe: large-scale immigration, greater resources, and the growth of the inhabitable parts of the country.

Yes. It's a noisy metric. However, the effect of labor laws was something that economists only started to look at seriously in the late 1980s to the best of my recall, which removes much (if not most) of the impact seen by the postwar boom in both continents. At this point it's a fairly safe assumption that both the U.S. and Europe have eaten the low-hanging fruit, as it were.

>Also, after WWII, West Germany and Japan had phenomenal economic growth and strong worker protection, just as the US did, for that matter. Remember how popular unions were in America, at a time when you yourself admit that America grew economically? Funny how that didn't stunt growth.

We were discussing the latter half of the 20th century. Union participation in America declined substantially in this period and has never recovered. There is no evidence of a causal link (here's your correlation/causation argument) between union presence and economic growth. If and when we support unions, we should do so for other reasons.

I think people on Reddit have grown so used to the popular dictum that labor = protected in Europe and labor = unprotected in America that they don't spend a lot of time examining the particulars. Protections in the U.S. against discrimination are actually quite similar to those seen in Europe while allowing for employer freedom to fire easily for performance or economic reasons. By contrast, the German government struck a deal with the nation's labor unions in the early 2000s to keep wages low in order to boost Germany's competitiveness after a lengthy period of economic malaise. It's difficult to see that happening in the U.S.

> That they have given up their dream of controling the Middle East?

I think they are still interested in protecting their interests and extending their influence in the region, just like all other major powers. Is that what you mean? Are you suggesting this was why the West ""started the Syrian Civil War""? If so, a source would be nice to back up this claim.

> On creating Daesh by leaving a vacuum of power in Iraq and seriously mishandling de-baath-ification of the new military?

I agree with this completely, except for maybe the phrasing which makes it sound premeditated. I wouldn't say that this fiasco being true means the West ""thought starting this shit in Syria was a good idea"" though.

> No responsibility for funding, arming, and backing the rebel groups in Syria?

Certainly the West provided piecemeal support here and there, but most of the support came from Turkey, SA, gulf states, etc (at least as I understand it). But again, supporting a side in an existing war does not mean starting the war.

I'm well aware of this, and it was in fact a part of the point I made in my original comment. 

>

>The smallest particles captured by filters are 0.3 microns.

That's not true. That's what I was saying. Filter material used in respirators such as N95s is tested against what's called a ""Most Penetrating Particle Size"" which is the particle size that the filter material will be least efficient at capturing. So for an N95, we would expect that particles both larger and smaller than the MPPS would be filtered out at a higher efficiently than 95%. 

The CDC has a good write-up on this here:

""This “most penetrating particle size” (MPPS) marks the best point at which to measure filter performance. If the filter demonstrates a high level of performance at the MPPS, then particles both smaller AND larger will be collected with even higher performance."" (oh look, I can make shit bold to condescendingly emphasize it too).

Hillary is under 2 investigations for very serious crimes, by the FBI...for crimes committed while in public service. trump is not under any investigation, so I think you are misinformed...unless you equate a civil lawsuit with an FBI investigation...strange from someone who claims to be an expert on the FBI.

"> How do you enforce ""common"" ownership without an entity that is essentially a state?

This isn't the place for an ideological debate. I'm not trying to convince you or anyone else to become an anarchist.

> ""Means of production"" is a meaningless term. Do you mean real property that produces personal property?

Again, this sub isn't for ideological debates, so I'm not going to get too far into this. When anarchists, communists, and all other kinds of socialists talk about means of production, they're referring to property that is used to produce goods. A factory and the machines and equipment inside it would be an example of means of production. In a socialist economy, that would be owned collectively, and the workers would decide how the factory was run democratically. 

> What happens when some workers have a disagreement with other workers about what should be done? Society collapses? Or a state-like entity (let's just call it a state) takes over?

Workplace democracy is basically the same as a democratic government, only in the workplace: the majority decides on something, and that's what happens. It could also take the form of representative democracy, with an elected council making decisions. Most would probably be a mix of both. 

I don't know why it's such a foreign concept to you.

> Since 99% of property is owned by private individuals and corporations, how will this be achieved without violent action on the part of a state-like entity (let's just call it the state)?

Again, this isn't an ideological debate. This is a question for /r/debateanarchism, not /r/neutralpolitics.

> According to whom? Sounds like ""If it's bad, then that's called capitalism, kids! But if it's magical fairy goodness, that's SOCIALISM! Yay!!!""

State capitalism is a real economic term, not something I just made up, and it means exactly what I said it means.

Is it not hypocritical to complain about ""passive voice"" and then create a straw man with a mocking and condescending tone?

> Completely wrong.. Plenty of sources in there that link directly to works on socialism, as well.

Von Mises didn't understand socialism. I tried reading his book on it, but he had the very definition wrong, and it only got worse from there. As for that article, I've seen it before. It's nonsense. Like von Mises, the author thinks of socialism as ""anything the government does"", which is objectively false. He points to economic planning as proof that the Nazis were socialists, as if one had anything to do with the other. 

> Can't ""be justified?"" Nice use of passive voice. Be justified by whom? God? Karl Marx? Obama?

Since that's how anarchists define anarchism, I don't see how my definition is biased. I never said what is or isn't justified. This isn't the place for that.

> I like how you just throw out definitions with no sources that differ from the dictionary definition and expect me to accept that. This is not /r/anarchism or /r/ELS, don't come here expecting that echo-chamber b.s. to fly.

You defined socialism as state ownership and control of the means of production. That's absolutely false, as any socialist would tell you. Again, this is hypocritical.

I told you what socialism and anarchism are as they would be described by a socialist or anarchist. Dictionary definitions aren't always correct, especially in this case. There are centuries of history behind those words that contradict your definitions and support mine.

> Some people who call themselves anarchists oppose those things. Other people who call themselves anarchists actually have differing viewpoints and don't expect everyone who subscribes to a philosophy to share the exact same platform. Go figure!

All anarchists oppose those things. If they don't, they're not anarchists, as anarchists are by definition opposed to hierarchies unless they can be justified. Just as someone who does not oppose the existence of a state is not an anarchist, neither is someone who does not oppose capitalism, classes, and social hierarchies.

>How crusades were 'sold' to the European population had a firm religious basis and is in itself an important cause of the war.

Theres nothing ""false"" about that dichotomy. How the war was sold has absolutely nothing to do with why the war was fought. Look at the Iraq fucking war.

It was sold on anti-terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. 

In reality, it created a shit load more terrorism, strengthened anti-American sentiment, found no weapons of mass destruction. 

Why is it so hard for you to understand the difference between what a war is about, and what a leader tells the populace?

"> weapons is a whole lot for only 14€.

We have a first rather big point of disagreement here. For that price, you can get a complete and finished game. As I have said, each and everyone is free to value their money how they want. I value mine more than what you cited. So how can we have a discussion then ? Well then for a starter, we can agree to respect other opinion. You should respect the opinion that people will feel that 14€ for the equivalent of a DLC (= more maps, more sounds, more weapons) is a lot. I also respect that you feel that this isn't alot. But then, we are left with the only element to judge: comparison. And other games in EA offer generally more than what you named for that price.

If the mod never existed and that DoI was released like that, without the modders that helped developping it, without the community testing it for months, I would say ""okay, that is near a fair price"". But we know this isn't what happened.

At this point, I feel important to underline what I said, instead of one might seem to think I said. I never said that the game is bad. I said that the game does not offer enough compared to the mod for its price. The game is rather good. Between the mod and the SA, I must have around 20 hours of game, which is pretty solid for someone that works a lot and can only play an hour or two in the evening.

>Now on to your ridiculous wishlist.

I really resent the condescendence of the ""ridiculous"", here. If anything, RO2 is a direct example that this isn't ""ridiculous"". It's possible and it was done in 2011. In terms of development and gaming, 5 years is huge. Realize it if you want to condescend people.

>Would you like horrible framerates? Cause that's how you get horrible framerates. Plus the game is already pushing the map design limits of the engine.

If your engine is not able to display maps without dropping your framerate, maybe change your engine.

>Oh my sweet summer child, you think World War Two was fought only with bolt actions or what?

That condescendence again. It's not only lacking respect, but it's also wrong. Do you realize how dumb you look by doing so ? You're talking to me like I'm some dimwite, all the while saying dumb shit. Yes, WW2 was primarily fought with bolt-actions. Not exclusively, this is why I said ""very limited access"", and not ""forbidden access"".

A quick link for you:  http 

A squad of 12 men had 9 people with bolt-action rifles. In the game right now, how many people out of 12 have a bolt-action rifle ? 1 ? 2 once in a moon ? I have never played with one ever, actually. All classes are able to get a semi-auto at the very least. You are so intent on defending the game that you are going full bad faith just to derail what we're talking about. Sad.

>No need for this, you're almost never gonna have an engagement past 100 meters.

Yes, that would be a fair point if I didn't talk about the need for bigger maps, but I did. So that's a rather dumb reply. Also, it matters even at 100 meters. Sniping without actual bullet travel is extremely easy. Bastogne as a sniper is a joke, point and click to kill people is not at all difficult.

>Not possible in the engine, nor is it plausible to have. You would see a dumbing down of detail in order to get such a novelty feature.

Yup. See above: change the engine.

>What is this even supposed to mean? There are objectives in the game and it's entirely possible to have to blow up something other than a radio. That's up to the level designer to do though.

it means exactly what you said: creative objectives, new things. You say it's to the level designer to do it, and yet it hasn't been done so far. So you could just say that you agree with what I said, we did not get new objectives. It could be done and it wasn't.

>Why? The game is about infantry combat, not combined arms.

Because you can't add vehicles without turning the game into ArmA ? Damn, you really want to defend the game tooth and nails, don't you ? Wolfenstein: ET, released 13 years ago, did it brilliantly. You would escort a vehicle, that would destroy objectives. The vehicle could be disabled, and would need to be repaired. You could get in the tank MG, but not actually drive it. The game had a vehicle and was still 99% about infantry combat.

>Hah, you really would want to play that shovelware? Red Orchestra 2 is but a mouse compared to the source material, a pitiful attempt to get as much money from more than just it's niche fanbase. Also, face it, Day of Infamy and Red Orchestra 2 are entirely different titles, that's like saying Day of Defeat was inferior to Battlefield 1942 because Battlefield had vehicles and larger maps.

What a load of bullshit to conclude your post. RO2 is a very succesful game, still very active despite being 5 years old. Even more bullshit with your comparison; DoD was about WW2 infantry combat, BF 1942 about combined arms combat.

RO2 and DoI are both about infantry combat, both in WW2, both aiming at realism. The comparison is perfectly legit. "

"> a lot of women here can have a BMR of 1500 or below and quite a few shorter men here can have BMR of 1800 or below.

never said they couldn't, and in fact, the calculations that I provide give plenty of room for this. And in anything, I'm actually on the opposite side of things. Because of my build and activity level, I'd still be dropping some weight at 2500cal/day, but that doesn't mean that dropping farther would be impossible.

> It also doesn't help that the 1500-2000 number is what most FAs use as a ""guideline"" for their ""supposed calorie intake"" and argue that any lower than the recommended guidelines, they gain weight. There are uncountable amounts of posts with bloggers telling their followers to eat 2000kcal ignoring factors like height, weight, age.

This is an unfair criticism and you know it. I never ONCE said anyone would gain weight through going below 1500, or even 1200. I'll grant that my wording could have been less ambiguous, but all I've ever suggested is that it would be less efficient than operating at greater metabolic adaptations. And I can't help it if they did a tiny bit of googling and found one of the many, many articles that give a similar range to the one I gave.

You need to understand, I live in Southern California, with my town having one of the highest concentrations of 21-25 year olds in the nation. I get far more beach blonde wanna-be Angels in my life than FAs, and some of them genuinely believe that starving themselves to the point of being below 800 calories per day is a safe way to lose weight. I probably should have extended the lower range of my numbers down to 1200, just to account for more people, and I'm more than happy to admit that. This is the only reason why I said the blanket ""it's as simple as below 2000 calories"" statement is a little misleading, because I have seen what people actually twist that into.

I should also mention, I study Kinesiology, and nutritional sciences are a pretty large part of the early curriculum, so the majority of my nutrition training revolves around getting the nutrients your body needs to operate well, not just achieving caloric deficit, and I need to remember that people genuinely value a marginal difference in caloric deficit over a complete nutritional profile, hence CICO being popular. If people can genuinely get a full nutrient profile on 1200 per day, then they are far more disciplined than I will ever be, and I tip my hat to them. That really isn't easy to do. Depending on your size, 1500 seems a bit more doable, but still difficult.

> I'll hazard a guess and say most of the redditors here lose weight successfully and maintained it without ever accounting for metabolic adaptation or they did and didn't know it. 

Completely, 100% accurate. You'll find no disagreement from me there. That being said, I do know a fairly large group of people who all go to the same gym down here, and they're militant about trying to account for it, as they were trying to get on stage together before long, and they were really focused on the most efficient fat burn possible while they cut. Just because the bulk of people don't do it, doesn't mean it isn't valid. It just isn't strictly necessary.

> Which, without further explanation

Hmm, almost like that is completely the reasoning behind my ""at least provide discussion if you're going to downvote"" statements. I can't very well clarify anything if people would rather downvote and move on then actually engage in the discussion. Since you actually decided to, I now I actually understand where I made a mistake, and if this had just been the m.o. from the get go, I think we could have avoided a lot of unnecessary bullshit.

One last thing. Stop trying to explain metabolic adaptation to me. It's the second time you've done it, when it's exceptionally clear that while we might disagree on certain numbers I've put forward (and that's fine), I have a firm grasp of concepts like metabolic adaptation, and I've demonstrated that at length. So pretending like you have to explain comes across as condescending as fuck. I'd prefer to keep this from being hostile, so if you could knock that off, it would be really swell."

">If I wanted to surprise you with a proposal, or would make one from the heat of the moment

Generally you can't. In healthy relationships, the prospect of getting married and timing of it should be discussed and shouldn't be a surprise. And, in a healthy relationship, if you're already on the same wavelength on timing, you can ""feel"" when something big is coming on because you're in sync. You know all those stories about people in relationships who can feel when they're getting cheated on or if there's something big coming along the way? People in tune with their partner can generally tell something's up -- especially with something as big as a proposal because it's something that you are presumably excited about as well. I didn't have anyone tell me it was coming, but I sure as hell knew it was coming. I didn't know precisely when, where or how, but I sure as hell knew it was coming.

But who are you to make a snarky judgemental comment about someone else being excited enough about a momentous occasion in my life to make an extra effort to look my absolute best as the man I'm in love with asks me to marry him? No, in the heat of the proposal, I'm not going to be thinking about my hair, my outfit, or my nails. I'm not going to be worried about not looking right. I was completely and totally in the moment. But why does that preclude wanting to look nice? I mean seriously. You dressed up for prom night, you dressed up for your first date. Why? Because you were excited and these were important events to you. A proposal is 1000x more important. The man I love is going to ask me to marry him and join our lives together and make a family. Why wouldn't you try to look nice if you knew it was coming? If I was going to dress up for our first date together, I'm certainly going to dress up on another milestone in our life together.

>Who needs beautiful, but staged photos when he's got that?

It's not a staged photo. Does putting on makeup make the emotion any less real? Does this suddenly mean we love him any less or the memory is somehow tainted? Does the dress suddenly stop my brain where I forget why he's proposing and I'm interrupting him to make sure my eyeliner is perfect? Suddenly, something important means we don't make an effort? I'm normally not a passive person -- I had to force myself to be passive in order to let him do the proposal because it was important to him, but it was IMPORTANT to me so I did everything I could to show that by contributing the one thing I COULD contribute. Do I know that he'd be just as happy if I said yes while wearing sweatpants with greasy hair after exercising at the gym? Hell yeah he would. But it was important to me to show effort. I wanted to look nice. Fuck me right? What was I thinking?

> I understand that having planning marathons and trying 100 dresses and cakes and having a color theme for the cloths and napkins and flower arrangements may all be ways for you to express how important this is to you. 

And dude, that's a HUGE gender stereotyping you're doing there. I bought my wedding dress in under 2 hours and tried on less than 5 dresses. My ""color theme"" was white. We added blue because that's what my husband wanted and he was just as involved in the planning as I was. If the guy isn't involved in the wedding planning, there's something wrong. It's a shared celebration and a shared responsibility about our SHARED relationship. And you know what? I didn't worry one bit about the details on the actual day.

But assuming that someone who wanted to look nice during important events in their life is vain and shallow with misplaced priorities that doesn't recognize that personal appearance comes in second to a lot of things is a shallow judgemental POS thing to say. You assume so much in your responses that it's actually insulting. You're treating all women like whatever stereotypical one you have in your head.

False. Women in the western world have more votes and therefore more political power than men.

> You don't understand the term ""minority"" do you? [..]

No need to be condescending. The comparison with the historical examples you gave is false, for two reasons:

1. The suppressed majorities you mention had fewer (formal and material) rights than the ruling minority. This is not the case for women in modern western world: they are deemed equal. Where I live, discrimination based on gender is prohibit in literally the first act of the constitution (and unlike in e.g. the US, the constitution applies to everyone, not just the government).

2. I still reject the fact that because a group is suppressed, that makes them a minority, and I don't see how your examples show any different. For example, I feel strongly that the Chinese people are suppressed by the Communist Party in the modern-day PRC (much like the peoples you mention were) and their human rights are routinely violated by the regime. According to your definition this makes the Chinese in China a minority; this makes zero sense to me.

>I am referring to rebalancing different asset classes within equity

Equity IS an asset class, so this makes no sense. There are different categories of equity, but equity is the asset class itself. The point of an asset class is that it is correlated. rebalancing between different ""funds"" in equity doesn't really mean anything for your overall return. I use a total stock market fund so technically I do that automatically (assuming you are comparing it to just sticking all of your money in individual stocks and not touching it). Rebalancing is typically used to refer to DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES, it does not raise your expected return. If you are rebalancing between two asset classes such as stocks and bonds then investing 100% in whichever one has the higher expected return will work out better in the long run. You are correct that we do not know what will be the highest in the future, but in general equities are expected to continue to outperform bonds, and therefore being 100% equities is ideal given a large risk tolerance. domestic or international equity may outperform, so it is probably best to buy both, but re-balancing itself does not add any value to the expected return. Given 2 assets with different expected returns going 100% with the higher of the two will result in a higher expected return than any rebalancing, that is math, buy low and sell high is not as effective as buying the asset with the highest expected return. That doesn't mean that is what you should do, or I should do. Diversifying is important, but that doesn't change that fact.

"> BTW--studies show that 95% of people who join AA quit as well, but for the 5% of people who stay, it works great.

Studies show that EVERY YEAR 5% of alcoholics quit drinking anyway. If AA is only retaining 5%, that means those people would have gotten better anyway - AA is not providing anything of use. Even AA's own inner studies have shown this:

>""The best that can be said for our exciting treatment is that we are certainly not interfering with the normal recovery process."" - AA's own internal research

>The Harvard Medical School reported that in the long run, the rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics is slightly over 50 percent. That means that the annual rate of spontaneous remission is around 5 percent.

>""About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab) programs and AA. Only 13 percent of people with alcohol dependence ever receive specialty alcohol treatment."" Source

In fact, 95% of the soldiers who used heroin during their tours of duty in Vietnam during the Vietnam War gave it up spontaneously, on their own, no ""treatment"" required, upon returning home. SO WHAT? That simply indicates that whatever crutch people turn to during moments of weakness and stress are discarded 95% of the time when people's circumstances improve. The rest form an addictive dependence on the crutch.

It's the same with the SGI. SGI recruits from the vulnerable, the ill, the poor, the suffering, the lonely, the troubled, and promises to deliver ""happiness"" (as all the cults do) and personal fulfillment. When the practice does not deliver on these promises, it is fair to walk away and not waste any more time on it - that's the only intelligent response, in fact. It doesn't work - this is evident in the 95% of those who leave - the other 5% would've gotten better anyhow; they're just crediting what they tried last. Just like the alcoholics. Just like the Vietnam heroin addicts. It's human nature to attribute success to the last thing tried, though that's a delusion. When someone has a spontaneous remission from cancer, they're likely to crow that it's because they went vegan or reduced their stress levels or chanted† or found Jesus - but in the end, it makes no difference. None of these are actually cures in themselves; REAL cures bring about the promised effect whether one believes in them or not. No ""trying"" required. An infant with a strep infection gets better from a shot of antibiotic even though he doesn't have any understanding and doesn't even WANT it! A comatose woman with the same infection will get better from the same type of antibiotic treatment without even being aware of it - that's because these treatments WORK. One person who had cancer who chanted made it to remission; dozens more who likewise chanted did not (including top SGI leaders). One person who prayed to Jesus saw his/her cancer go into remission; dozens of others who likewise prayed to Jesus did not. People who do nothing out of the ordinary see their cancers inexplicably go into remission, their tumors spontaneously disappear. It happens far more frequently than even most doctors realize.

So the person who credits THEIR practice with their successful outcome, while basically sneering at and blaming those who did not get a successful outcome despite doing the same practice, saying, ""Oh, they didn't understand...they were lazy...they passively expected someone else to do everything for them...they didn't walk the walk...they weren't doin it rite..."" really are horrible people. Victim blaming is one of the lowest, creepiest, nastiest forms of bullying a person can choose. Why go to such lengths to distance yourself from others and make them out to be basically horrible people?? That's not necessary. Why are you defending your practice to the death, essentially?

On the one hand, you claim that the practice can help anyone:

>This form of Buddhism could be practiced even by the illiterate because one could derive benefit from simply chanting the TITLE of the Lotus Sutra--because the mere title actually DOES contain the essence of the ideas presented in the Sutra itself, emphasizing the importance of Karma.

>Sigh...the mechanism is that just the words of the title relay a basic--and very important-- teaching of Buddhism: the importance of cause and effect. If someone simply grasps and applies this concept (the whole idea of Karma)--even if they JUST do that, it will be beneficial.

>As for the other benefits. All of the benefits I listed before that are associated with meditation in general would happen if someone chanted regularly, simply because it is a form of meditation. This would happen automatically whether the person understood the practice or not...

On the other hand, you're full of excuses for why it doesn't:

>When you engage in pure positive visualization and just bask in the glow of your imagined future success, and leave it at that

Who does that??

>whether you actually put the teachings into action or you just passively expect chanting alone to fix everything...basically, I think it comes down to whether you walk the walk or just talk the talk

So YOU KNOW whether someone's walking the walk or not. How?

>he taes NO positive action. He makes bad causes constantly, creating terrible consequences for himself. If you aren't even going to try to LIVE by the principle

How do you know this? What is your basis for believing he's not doing the best he possibly can? How is it that YOU know the reality of his life better than HE does?

>After all, you are proving by your negative actions that you are not devoted to the concept of Karma in the least!!

Really. When Nichiren teaches that you can get out of the karma loop by just chanting and doing nothing else. Riiiiight O_O

>it just means that they haven't been willing to put in the necessary effort to MAKE it work

You win ""Most Condescending post of the day"" bro.

I figured out the entire layout of Old Russia and The Moon in two passes each. in Titanfall, BF4, BF3, BC2, Halo 3, and Halo 4, I was one of the best players in the world. I have beaten Dark Souls (both games) at level one, etc, etc. Suffice to say I am very good at learning the mechanics and layouts of the games I play. And guess what? I want a map as well.

It is not a ""fundamental misunderstanding"" to want a map in this game. By that logic, it's a fundamental misunderstanding to want better social features because that's the way Bungie made the game. 

Just because someone is critical of the game does not mean they are children meant to be talked down too."

Thank you for sharing you’re knowledge on the fact. I was not aware that it was used across various continents. I’d suggest that when you share you’re insights or correct someone’s faulty views on a subject that you do so in a less condescending manner, out of respect for your fellow being. "

">However I do not see any absolute right to bear arms.

As you so condescendingly put it, you might want to 'try reading your constitution then instead of spouting nonsense', or perhaps you may have misunderstood what I meant. Let me clarify.
 
By 'absolute', I do not mean an unrestricted and unfettered right, but a right that is absolute in the sense that the said right is guaranteed directly and explicitly in the constitution with, like Freedom of Speech, Religion, press etc. There is no right to own property specifically stated under any amendment, so I would classify this as a non-Constitutional/non-absolute right, but one that is still provided under common law.

So what I am trying to say is that I see no reason why the right to bear arms should be on the same pedestal as free speech, or the right to vote, and I don't see why it needs to be specifically enumerated and protected, restrictions notwithstanding.

To put it clearer, I am suggesting that the 2nd amendment shouldn't exist. A Constitution should guarantee free speech and other such basic civil rights to its people. The right to own a weapon isn't such a civil right.

"> This is a temporary state. I consistently see people on this sub imagining that the results of a few hundred hours of meditation or less produces the same results as a few thousand hours. Most people on this sub are novice meditators and they extrapolate from their current experiences what things will be like if they continue. It's like the person saying ""I drink coke occasionally and I'm perfectly healthy therefore if I drink 20 cokes a day for 10 years I'm going to be in exactly the same situation"". This makes no logical sense.

While I find myself disagreeing with much of what you say I do agree with this statement. The current state of meditation 'marketing' (ughhh!) is busy selling people something that probably isn't what the expect. Most people on here (r/meditation) have expectations of meditation as some kind of life hack, which it isn't at all. I would agree with you that meditation probably isn't for everyone and the current boom seems to be peaking with a gaggle of dangerously inexperienced self help gurus presenting themselves as 'teachers' of meditation.

> I'm sorry, but you don't understand how the process works. If you've done any serious meditation you'll notice that you'll randomly experience different emotions. They come out of nowhere and have no relation to your current situation. This is due to the fact meditation is a purging process. It is delving into your subconscious and pulling emotions out of you. 

And this is where I disagree with you. First off it is condescending to tell people that they don't understand something. I got it that you disagree with u/wittyusernamesonly but s/he has an experience that is as valid as yours is especially in the realm of something subjective like meditation. I have a lot of experience with meditation (I'm 60 now and started when I was 19) and have spent a consistent 8000+ hours on the cushion since 2002 (my 'streak' as the kids like to say). The time prior to that was off and on trying different methods etc. For whatever reason I got 'serious' in 2002. I have not noticed random emotions ""come out of nowhere and have no relation to your current situation"". I don't see meditation as purgative at all. In my experience (and this is my experience, not anyone elses) it might better be described as 'attenuative' with regards to emotion. I agree with u/wittyusernamesonly that I am more aware of emotions. Emotion is still very much available to me and I have much more control over it. I can surrender to it now. For example I have experienced deep emotion over the passing of a dear friend recently. It wasn't overwhelming but I could surrender to it in a way that I might not have in the past for fear of bing overwhelmed. In general my experience is that meditation has opened up other aspects of experience to me (or maybe I've just matured). 

Different people have different experiences with meditation. I acknowledge that it has been a rough road for you and you are unhappy with the outcome. With all due respect I think from your descriptions you might benefit from the help of both a counselor that is familiar with meditation as a practice (rather than a tool for short term intervention) and a meditation teacher to sort out your experience.

If you decided the sky was pink and I physically showed you it was blue, you'd find a way to deflect that as well. Your claim was that it is unambiguous that the entire Bible is anti-homosexual, based on two isolated passages. I don't know how to make you see that, on its face, that's a terribly flawed argument. You want to believe something is one way, and you're not interested in things like, you know, facts and logic. You took a position first, and now you're struggling to defend it.

> At any rate I'm getting tired of getting instantly downvoted whenever I reply to your comments anyways. I've not been hostile and have simply stated my stance (which remains unchanged).

">When did you move to the US? The peak year of European immigration was in 1907 which was before the spanish civil war, great war, second world war or the soviet union. Did you move their recently? Otherwise what does that have to do with it?

I was more specifically talking about the European immigration that preceded 1776. For your information, if you find it relevant, half of my family was here for that. The Italian side didn't come until 1942. To further your information both sides of my family came to this country to escape ""European nationalism"" be it under the guise of a crown or a dictator.

>The people who moved to america came from different cultural backgrounds to form a nation which was new, presumably they would have been able to learn from their own cultural backgrounds and apply that?

>erm... yes very defensive.

Once again. It's offensive that Europeans ""look down"" on Americans for participating in a system that was pioneered in Europe and still continues to this day. Furthermore, unless I am very much ignorant of my political history but was it not European nationalism which was the underlying root of the entire political stability across the Middle East & North Africa?

"> Serious question - what if there just aren't enough progressives to form a majority?

> Don't you guys need to cut your losses at some point and take some more moderate dems who will vote with you 90+% of the time anyway? 

I'm very honest and open about this: I'm not a Berniecrat. I voted for him in the primaries and would have voted for him in the general but I'm much further left. I had a number of criticisms against Bernie Sanders. I want you to know this because I'm not very representative of the sub. My opinion here is probably the minority. 

To answer your question: if the left faction of the Democratic Party cuts their losses and just accepts whomever the party runs then what incentive is there for the party to adequately represent these voters? If you're allowed to feel adequately represented, why can't they? 

I suspect most voters are like you in that had Sanders won the primary, they'd have voted for him. If this is the case then it makes sense to chase after the voters who wouldn't vote like you. Elections are about earning votes. If the party has already earned your vote, you should encourage them to chase after votes they hadn't earned. 

This is why poll after poll showed Sanders in a better position to beat Trump in the general election. Sanders would have picked up the majority of Clinton voters and the voters Clinton didn't. He expanded the base beyond Clinton's. 

I'm awaiting all of the political scientists to publish the data they've picked up from this election cycle but I suspect it mirrors a lot of what I personally experienced when I canvassed and called on behalf of phone banks: ""I'm not voting for Clinton but I would have voted for Bernie.""

It was a dumb strategy for the Democratic Party to alienate Independent voters and leftists. They were over confident in their ability to beat Trump.

I honestly think your opinion is ridiculous and ill founded. If we tell gays to use condoms, we will end HIV. This policy has failed and we need to move to PrEP. 

You just won't accept some people won't use condoms. We can use your approach which is tell them to use them, they won't use them and they will get HIV. Lets pretend condoms are the only policy and allow HIV to exist

Or we can be real and use 30 years of research, where we know some gay men just won't use condoms, get them on PrEP and stop them getting HIV. 

You are so so condescending calling people who use PrEP as irresponsible. What is irresponsible about someone taking PrEP, that they went to effort of ordering online? People are preventing getting HIV with PrEP and you are saying they are irresponsible? 

Your mindset and attitude of 'just use a rubber' will be the reason why we will still have HIV in 30 years.

However, if you referr to theory that all living things can be genetically traced back to one ancestor, than I think you are faced with the question of intellegent design. 

I personally beleive in God, so I admit I am not sure whether he made us in what WE PERCEIVE to be instant, or the blink of an eye along with other animals, or used the process of evolution to create it. Believing in God means acknowledging his omnipotence which is incoprehensible to the human mind.

The alternative is believing in domino effect of the big bang theory.

To argue for the validity of natural selection, you first have to establish wether we live in an universe created and looked after by God, or a domino effect of cause and reaction.

Notice how the numbers completely fail to account for Blast damage? Because I did. Given that fact, I don't see what that even proves. 

>Myxo Demolisher is still a great weapon for early-mid G-Rank, but Nero and Cera are better. Pretty much every single forum post, discussion, guide and game story, agree on those two weapons.

Forum posts are your source? I'm showing you videos of Japanese speedrunners, who, as a rule, optimize for the fastest damage output. They're using the Myxo Demolisher, not the Nero's Anguish. Forum posts aren't really a source, and aren't useful information, especially when they're failing to account for the Blast damage done by the Myxo Demolisher. 

What are you going to do next, post GameFAQs links?

>First of all, Slime has a CHANCE to proc with each attack. Of course you CAN have more procs with the right skills, leading to more explosions on certain quests. That's just a statistical fluctuation. Cherry-picking two videos as a proof isn't conclusive at all. Again, I proposed 2-3 blows per quest as a rough estimate for all the grinding I've done with my own Myxo Demolisher.

Just like how Cera Cymmetry has a chance to critical or negative critical. If you watched the videos, you'd notice that Efenbaum actually gets really unlucky, triggering Blast buildup much less than 33% of the time.

>Second, YOU started talking about speedrunning. Again, speed killing heavily depends on your playstyle, but in GENERAL TERMS (as I said), faster weapons which can exploit idle times, elemental weaknesses and/or status are better for speedrunning as Slime weapons as a solo hunter, specially because monsters build resistance to Slime the more you apply to them. That means less frequent explosions for a weapon with the same damage potential. Also, stop cherry-picking videos over Youtube. Isolated cases aren't proof of a statistical tendency.

The talk proves a point. Speedrunning is just about the one thing that's the least dependent on playstyle possible. When you're trying to maximize your damage output over a short period of time, you're going to try to use whatever method objectively leads to the fastest kills, forgoing personal playstyle as a consequence. 

Also, you're still dead wrong about faster weapons being better for speedrunning. I see far more Greatsword speedrun around than Dual Blade speedruns. 

If you think I'm cherry-picking, post some counter-examples.

>Third, Cera Cymmetry needs Crit Draw because the skill adds 100 affinity to your seathed attacks, that means that instead of having a 20% chance of whiffing your Seathed Attack (and considerably lowering your burst damage potential), you have an 80% chance of dealing insane damage with that same seathed attack.

I'm still not seeing how Critical Draw is more useful for the Cera Cymmetry than other weapons. If you treat affinity as an adjustment of raw, Critical Draw gives the same 25% damage bonus to draw slashes as other greatswords, except it's less consistent about it. 

Your statement is roughly in line with forum posts that talk about affinity as ""would you rather have an X% chance of doing 25% more damage"" rather than ""you can adjust raw for affinity by multiplying the affinity by 25%, multiplying that by the weapon's raw, then adding it back onto the original raw"". Mathematically, the Cera Cymmetry doesn't benefit more from Critical Draw than any other greatsword. 

>Finally, my final statement about consistently landing lvl 3 Seathed Attacks isn't me being ""full of shit"", is the bread-and-butter Greatsword tactic and what every single Greatsword player says to new Greatsword wielders all around the Internet. It's no secret that consistently landing those sweet lvl 3 attacks increases your damage output by a landslide, and at the end of the quest they give more overall damage than simply smashing the X and A buttons alternately like if you were weaving a flag.

And you're still doing the exact same thing - being a condescending asshole. I know that Greatswords are about landing level 3 charges, you fucking idiot. I don't need some smug smartass to tell me that. If you want a civil conversation, don't start it with rudeness.

EDIT: Also, here's some proof that I'm right. Assuming 5 explosions (the number in the video I posted) the Myxo Demolisher does outperform Nero's Anguish."

"> The key thing is inferred. Great. They were inferred that way. But they were not observed. 

There's still a causal order of events that starts with an objectively real, observable event. And if it were observed, it would be a prosteriori. A priori knowledge doesn't come from no where. You just can't claim ""god is timeless and eternal"" based on nothing.

And by the way, math doesn't make your god real. Math makes physics real. Thermodynamics is a description of closed systems. No outside help necessary. 

> It is. We can demonstrate this with a simple thought experiment about aliens. Math is often thought to be a universal language. When communicating with the stars, we look for things like prime numbers and so forth as a means by which to see an artificial signal. But since their development must be by definition alien to ours, why is it that we expect that we would be able to talk through math?

> The answer is that math is discovered, not invented.

Anything can be argued from the perspective of an arbitrary thought experiment in the absence of evidence. But this whole diatribe above is just plain wrong. 

Math is invented. Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Calculus are all separate schools of mathematics. They were invented independently at different periods in history. And same with the number zero. These ""discoveries"" are discoveries between mechanical relationships between systems, like determining height based on the angle of a tangent. Math isn't a singular phenomenon. Its a description of our environments. And the numberline isn't objectively real. Trigonometry was first developed for a base 60 system in Egypt. Every counting system has different multiplication tables due to the length of their repetitions and how they're symmetry breaks with scale. 

The reason why the numberline works is because its comprised of discrete, quantized units. Any counting system will work. But they work because real systems obey conservation, and are made up of quantized units. If you have 10 particles in a container, unless you have a nuclear reaction, you're not suddenly going to get 11 our of no where. But no matter what base counting system you use, there are many ways to represent those 10 particles. Its the particles that are real, not the numbers you're using to count them. 

> Conjecture is not proof. Please do not confuse the two.

This is what I keep telling you. A priori knowledge is conjecture. Not proof. 

> I suppose you might try to dismiss a proof that you don't like as conjecture, but this is an irrational line of attack.

You mean like sourcing where you got this claim from? ""God is eternal and timeless."" The burden of proof falls on the one making the affirmative claim. All you've done is defend your right to purport baseless conjecture, and now I'm dismissing proof you didn't provide? You're misapplying these terms beyond any reasonable application. You're entire god argument depends on whether or not 2 + 2 = 4. Do you not realize how far removed and unrelated that is? 

> You can't just say that because it's a proof, it is conjecture, as you do here

Its a good thing I didn't. This is the second absurd claim you've made in this response that wasn't made, but you purported in order to claim was absurd. And its easy to present an absurd argument and then claim its absurd. Proof is not conjecture. Just like a priori knowledge is not proof. Its deduction, but its not conclusive beyond a reasonable doubt. For that you need evidence, which is objectively real prior to interpretation. 

> Not true. Validity is can be quite easy to demonstrate using terms I just made up:

> All A are B.
> All B are C.
> Therefore, all A are C.

> Perhaps you meant to say soundness?

I did not mean soundness and again, this is wrong. But don't take my word for it. Here's a wikipedia link: A Syllogism constitutes an assumption, not proof. Like the example above, its not conclusive beyond a reasonable doubt. Its just a belief that's most likely true based on the information available to. But to know, you need evidence. Direct measurements, not just inferences. 

> A logical proof is a form of evidence. And a more certain one than the empirical observations that you seem to be in a monogamous relationship with.

No its not. Empirical observations are objectively real prior to interpretation. Your terrible satire aside, there is nothing you can believe or produce that can refute something that objectively exists right in front of you. That's an argument for ignorance. You might as well claim that sense can't be known, and that's wrong. We can directly perceive real events and our environment, even if every attempt to communicate them is conjecture. 

> Evidence and knowledge have definitions. Evidence is something that can be used to support a claim. An argument is a claim supported by evidence. Knowledge is a true justified belief(). And so forth.

> Nowhere in those definitions does the fine print read, ""...and only reliable measurements are allowed"".

Fine print? This isn't the bible. You're reading these terms like a divine, irrefutable instruction manual. Words refer to things. They're not objectively real by themselves. So picking one cherry picked definition and declaring them absolute doesn't prove anything. Evidence is objectively real prior to interpretation. Its a physical phenomenon that exists whether you believe it or not. But your confusing evidence with your interpretation of it. 

> This absurd insistence that a form of evidence, with only modest levels of confidence, is the only form of evidence is not only a logical fallacy you make, but is the cancerous irrationality that lurks at the heart of modern atheism.

You're describing the cancerous denial of events that precede our interpretation of them that enables theism. Theism is just an excuse to purport a persons confirmation bias, like your doing with evidence. It literally justifies make belief, and you can't come to accurate conclusions if you can't base those conclusions on evidence. That's why I'm morally obligated to refute you. Theism causes conflict. You can't infer causation or tell whats real or not. Information is just handed to you by a hierarchy of pre-approved material, it doesn't teach you to come to causal inferences on your own. It dis-empowers you from doing that by feeding into your confirmation bias and need to be pleased.

But indeterminate conjecture is immoral. If you can't reason your position, there are plenty of other reasons why people make this crap up. Egocentric reasons. But the ego doesn't tell us about the universe. Its absolutely egocentric and functions to protect the self. And in between people, they overlap and create conflict.

But the universe is structured. There is a finite causal order of events and everything in it obeys thermodynamics. And having certainty about these claims gives us the freedom to apply this knowledge and produce results, or develop technology.

> This entire paragraph is a classic example of someone working through cognitive dissonance.

Dissonance of what? You didn't provide any evidence. You're a priori argument is cognitive dissonance. All you did are argue your right to purport indeterminate conjecture. You didn't support your original claim. Also, you only accuse me of cognitive dissonance to ignore the rational criticisms I'm making of your augment. That quote is definitive and to the point. But your just going to deny anything that doesn't fit into your narrative, aren't you? And present more a priori arguments that equate to proof in your mind. 

> You think you're a smart person

The core of every theists defense. 

> but your thought system isn't apparently capable of understanding how a logical proof could be used to support a claim,

I've already stated how it does. Subjective phenomenology is causally preceded by objective phenomenon. A priori knowledge is relative and deduced. Your making the mistake of claiming that its absolute, and then grouping your god logic into it. I'm referring to a causal order of events starting with real phenomenon. But its almost like you don't believe reality exists.

That's why you think I'm so smart. Because I have certainty and you don't. But certainty is assumed in-order to apply information. No person is ever absolutely certain, but there are definitive, discrete solutions no matter what we believe. It just takes observing something outside of yourself to know the difference.

> I suggest you engage in a thorough bout of introspection and work through your epistemic holes before you try to project your self-doubts onto someone else.

Don't condescend to me with pseudologic you're unable to support. I know its difficult to believe in theism without relying on false moral superiority, but that only invalidates your argument further by demonstrating a motive to make this stuff up. If your argument could stand up on its own merit, it would. Or am I just engaging in cognitive dissonance again?

Its funny how theists reapply the terms used against them to reinforce their narrative, but deep down I think its because you know you're making this stuff up. None of this conjecture (again, not proof) can be applied in the real world. All of this conjecture is meant to support your feelings. It has nothing to do with real phenomenon. Even your math argument wasn't applied. If you think there are epistemic holes in my argument, then the burden of proof is on you to support that claim. But in the absence of evidence, nobody should believe it. We're morally obligated to base our assumptions on real events. Otherwise we're just making stuff up. And without evidence, there's no common ground and there can be no compromise. "

"> The current trend towards cavalierly dismissing entire fields of study because they produce conclusions that are not neat, tidy, and ideologically-pleasing is extraordinarily dangerous to free academia and critical though

See now you just injected your own interpretation of why people are dismissing ideologically-driven sociological papers. I assume you disagree with notions of white supremacy or eugenics in previous eras, yeah? 

Or would you be just ""dismissing entire fields of study because they produce conclusions that are not neat, tidy, and ideologically-pleasing."" Reflecting your perspective on more obviously ridiculous notions reveals how problemed it is.

Like, congratulations that you agree with the rhetoric echoed in social justice courses. The way you dismiss the building counter-movement against it reeks of dogmatic adherence to the social justice kool-aid from my perspective - not even acknowledging the fact there are valid criticisms of it, instead opting for a derogatory/condescending caricature of the arguments against the growing social justice ideological bend of some sociological papers.

>The world is not going to conform itself to your worldview all of the time. If you accept that to be true then you should withdraw your pre-judgmental criticisms.

>Perhaps that's a step you should take before forming an opinion as the the validity of the claim - not to mention all of sociology, for that matter.

Implying I haven't read sociology papers or researched the origins of the asinine 'cant be racist against white people herpderp'. 

My opinion about sociology isn't unique - it is even shared by many professors who state as much in the courses I've taken, particularly about the dubious methodology in much of the research in the social sciences.

Anyways, looking forward to reading the papers you've linked. I'm already excited by the first one and can't wait to see their methodology and sample size.

">Profit is revenue minus costs: a pretty simple idea. Now obviously such calculations can become very complicated very quickly, but that's up for each business owner to figure out; and if they screw it up, they suffer an economic penalty. 

You're skating around my question, which is how does one measure who individually makes more profit for the company. Don't condescend to me, especially if you're not actually answering the questions I asked.

>In their respective fields, yes. Each was was several hundred million to several billion dollars.

Try broadening your scope a little to the central players in the global capitalist system.

>What exactly is this list? What is your point?

It's like you don't even bother to read any source I give you. Do you recall any of that research about the centralization of capital? These are the top 50 companies that control the most capital in the world.

>Of those, I know Lehman failed a few years back, and several of the American banks received bailout money. Of course, the fact that this many large banks exist means it is completely impossible for the situation you described, where the existing players lower prices whenever a competitor tries to enter the market, to occur. 

Once again, had you bothered to read literally anything I've posted so far, you would be aware that these 50 companies are all interconnected in that they own shares in one another. Look it up; I gave you a link, too.

>Excuse me? Profit is precisely mathematically defined. When it comes to individuals in a large corporation, the profit any given person is responsible for may be difficult to calculate, but that does not make the concept of profit at all ill-defined. 

Again, not even close to what I was saying. See above. I really don't appreciate you feigning ignorance to avoid the question.

>This statement doesn't mean anything in the context of a private firm, because it's not your business and not my business what someone else does with their money in a voluntary contract with other free people.

Except the owner is the one holding all of the cards. How free are you when you agree to anything just to be able to make a living? That still doesn't even come close to answering my question: How does one measure who individually makes ""more"" profit for the enterprise than another?

>Moreover, it is in the best interest of the owners and supervisors of the employed to be as accurate as possible. Any error results in economic loss.

This has nothing to do with what I asked either. Goodness.

>Also, profit is a real number. Putting quotation marks around ""more"" with regards to profit makes it seem like you don't know what ""<"" and "">"" mean. 

Yeah, keep acting the prick. It makes your argument that much stronger.

>And without food of some kind, there'd be no labor. ...

Keep saying that.

>Let's simplify for a minute. Say we want to define value to be labor, in some measurement. In mathematics and logic, if A is defined as B, then A and B are logically equivalent: A iff B. In other words, A is both necessary and sufficient for B. So are labor and value equivalent? 

This is a little off. ""IFF"" means ""if and only if,"" and it implies that one thing is a condition of the other thing. If A is logically equivalent to B, then B is not a condition for A or vice versa; they're the same thing. A = B. 

>Obviously Marx defined ...

Your understanding of the L.T.V. is horribly confused. Neither Marx nor Engels (nor Lenin, Stalin, Hoxha, etc.) ever asserted that value is wholly determined by labor alone. ""Labor is not the source of all wealth. Nature is just as much a source of use values (and it is surely of such that material wealth consists!) as labor which is itself only the manifestation of a force of nature, human labor power."" (Marx, Critique of the Gotha Program) I know I've posted this quote before...

Hopefully by now you've begun to realize you're more than a little off not only with your understanding of fundamental logic, but also of Marxian L.T.V.

>Analogies are not false or true, they are more or less accurate.

Your understanding of logic leaves a lot to be desired.  http "

it tells me he is ok with a president that has no respect for the institutions, free media, judicial system and all the people that didnt vote for him, and who has tinkered with the idea of ""locking up journalists"" 
It tells me he is ok with a President who not could be compromised and could have cohordinated with the biggest enemy the US has had since WW2 in hacking his opposing party, or at least we know he ecouraged them to do so 
it tells me he is ok with a President that is openly against Science, and is working to cripple our education system 
It tells me he is ok with a president that wants to get millions off health care, create dozens of new prehexisting conditions that would cripple families, all in order to make a big tax cut for the rich.
Just the fact you say he thought Trump would be ""tougher on ISIS"" tells me you have been sold this meme as well. 
Dropping some bomb in Afghanistan or launching missiles over dinner without attending to even half your intelligence briefings is not what is gonna solve this, 
Hillary has been known to be far more hawkish on foreign policy than many dems are comfortable with, and trump has very close deals with the Saudis, who are the main supporter of ISIS and that whole terrorist ecosystem.

I'll give him the benefit of the doubt since I actually havent heard him mention trump once, and he may have changed his mind after seeing how he was duped by trump, but if he mentions it and says he is still cool with him, then I guess that's it

"You're cute, DJR. 

I understand semantic range just fine. I don't think my professors would be embarrassed at all at my comment (but I appreciate an economics PhD such as yourself giving me insight into what a theology professor would think), as I was making a rhetorical point (which you seemed to have missed). 

I'll lay it out here for both you and /u/ManitouWakinyan to make it simpler for me: 

u/moby__dick said, ""The NASB has a translation philosophy that tells us what the text says, not what it means.""

/u/ManitouWakinyan replied, ""The word 'brothers' isn't in the original text either.""

This is flatly incorrect based upon any reading of the text, including your own. This is the context in which I made my point. 

A wooden translation in all my Greek classes, regardless of what you might think dear professor, is what was required by my professors, one of whom learned Greek from Metzger. 99.9999% of the time, ἀδελφοὶ was translated as ""brothers"" in Greek class because, wouldn't you know it, that's the most wooden translation of the term. Isn't that what the NASB does? Oh yeah! Moby made that point for us! 

You said,

> Brothers is never used to refer to mixed gender groups in contemporary English, so using it to translate ἀδελφοὶ in that context is just a bad translation, full stop.

Be more careful in your reading, DJR. I was responding to a specific point, not saying ἀδελφοὶ doesn't or can't refer to ""siblings/brothers and sisters/cousins/etc."" I completely agree that in most instances it's a fine (and even preferred) translation. But, again, to say ""brothers"" isn't in the original text is dishonest. It wasn't meant to be an exhaustive listing of the semantic range. 

What you've written here is what's covered in first semester Greek. So don't play condescending with me.

You're making an overly pedantic point I don't even disagree with, and being condescending about it, when you don't even understand the point I'm making. But hey, shoot off before even asking what I meant. That's always a great idea. "
"> Please tell me how one would critique the practice then?

Exactly as it was done, without the explicit reference to who was practicing it.

> It is absolute balderdash to make them have to censor themselves while critiquing practices that were practiced by Hindus and Muslims at the time. 

You are talking about censorship -- I'm talking about honesty and goodness. I wouldn't give a damn about censoring the word ""fuck"" or ""shit"" or ""once there was a guy who impaled people from asshole to mouth-hole"" -- assuming there's a context for those things. I am only talking about ways to address overgeneralizations.

And prejudices about ""black"" people aren't any more helpful or accurate when a ""black"" person is the source. It may matter to YOU that ""Muslim saints"" were the ones overgeneralizing about Muslims -- but it really changes nothing for me. I'm talking about the practice, NOT who's practicing it.

All your mentions of critiquing practices are irrelevant to my complaint. My only complaint regards UNNECESSARY PREJUDICE -- I full accept critiques of many kinds -- I just think that we also need to CRITIQUE our CRITIQUES so that we CRITIQUE things more CRITICALLY.

> I have to guess that you’re not a fan of poetry or literary devices at all then? That everything must be cut and dry? What’s the point? If you’re simplifying it so that it’s more accessible to people…you have to realize that the very people you’re targeting won’t be pleased you are modifying it, mainly because you have no authority to do so.

Okay, first of all, if you think I'm not a fan of poetry or literacy devices, you didn't carefully read my responses to you. I was extremely clear about that.

Second, I'm not just targeting YOU and people LIKE you -- I'm trying to target the whole world with better ideas -- if I convince everyone BUT the Gurus, that's fine with me. I am not trying to modify anything in a GENERALLY REPULSIVE way -- that would be a huge waste of my time -- I am only trying to modify it to make it appeal to MORE PEOPLE. If I can make a positive message appeal 50% less to YOU but 50% more to 100,000 OTHER people, I have still achieved a positive result. It's not POSSIBLE to please everyone with this text -- some will find the language offensive; and some, like you, will defend it to its death -- my goal, therefore, is simply to please as many people as possible, as much as possible -- and that means ALL people, INCLUDING Muslims (many of whom legitimately COULD benefit from better religious guidance); not just Sikhs and their Gurus -- without sacrificing truth, relevance, or positive impact. I come here first largely to feel out reactions from the English-speaking Sikh community -- NOT because this is ""the very people I'm targeting"", as you seem to infer...

> mainly because you have no authority to do so.

Well, that's a little bit misleading. All authority is God's, and God can act through anyone. No one can deny any one else's authority to attempt to change the world around them. I might not make Guru-approved changes -- I might not have authority in some extremely narrow sense of the word -- but I can certainly make changes, and those changes might be accepted by the masses, and that's all I really care about.

> Any type of literature runs risk. Doesn’t 1984 run the risk of giving actual totalitarian governments ideas for how to implement their tyranny? In the real world, people try to educate others-dumbing down everything just isn’t practical and doesn’t work.

To your first question -- definitely not, totalitarians already know everything Orwell was telling the proles. 

To your second claim -- in the real world, ""dumbing down"" has a much different meaning. You're trying to use loaded language to evaluate a process that is not a true dumbing-down in any valid sense. Making things more reasonable, accurate, and unoffensive is not ""dumbing them down."" It's ""broadening their scope."" I'm not suggesting that the history of Sikh culture be ignored and forgotten. I'm saying the messages of its Living Guru would in-all-likelihood have a greater positive impact on the world, if they were relieved of some of their latent, outdated prejudices. 

Besides that -- regarding your premise -- in the real world, the communication of an important idea is more important than the words you use to communicate it. Everything in the world, including the Sikh holy book, can ultimately be broken down into extremely simple, digestible concepts that a child could understand -- and everything must be broken down this way if we want to encourage children to learn more things faster. A convoluted explanation never helped any child learn faster -- ""dumbed-down"" explanations help all the damn time. So it's not always better to avoid dumbed-down explanations, in principle. That reasoning is flawed. But regardless, as I said, I'm not ""dumbing down"" anything, except in the loaded sense that you're trying to force on this situation -- where ""dumbing down"" actually means ""deviating from Sikh standards"".

> Oh come on now. It’s an Islamic practice. Sure, there may be Muslims that don’t bury their dead, there may very well also be Muslims that don’t believe in God and are cultural Muslims. Again, welcome to literature and communication 101.

Now you're SERIOUSLY being condescending. AND you're being a bigot. Generalizing about people is never helpful. That is NOT going to unite the world under anything good. When you act so dismissive and reductionist about Muslims, it shows your prejudice, and it runs the risk of driving Muslims away.

Things like age of consent, age to use drugs, etc. Are there for a reason. Because the physical and or mental maturity of persons under that age is considered not developed enough to handle such things.

The age of consent exists because kids are impressionable and easy to manipulate and thus are not judged as fit to give consent. Whether or not their bodies are able to reproduce is not what the argument was ever about."

> Richard Lewis used to WRITE for Breitbart and wasn't even a fervent right winger,

Do you understand how editorials work? He was never employed by Breitbart, he's a full time comedian for work. He happens to occasionally write articles that ran on the site. He was never employed by them full time. 

>You don't need to be politically affiliated with whatever platform you're working for, especially if your work has nothing to do with expressing your beliefs.

You don't need to be, but at a news org like Breitbart, everyone is. 

>What's your point here? That because he's known to say offensive things, everyone who's aware of that wouldn't go see a talk of his because that's too much for them to handle? I mean, what?

My point is that you're pretending that it's somehow outrageous that there are protestors there, when Milo's entire point of existence is to try and outrage as many people as possible. 

Anyone attending knows this, and they'd know what they were walking into. 

>Yet I could see myself going to see a talk of his, especially if someone I knew was also attending. Curious how that immediately refutes the implied sentiment that at every Milo talk, the room must be filled with people who think exactly like him. 

I didn't say everyone in the audience was his supporters, but you can bet your damn behind that a good portion of them were. Milo's supporters are especially fervent. 

>Already given you an example of someone who worked for Breitbart who doesn't even identify as a right winger 

An occasional columnist isn't actually employed by Breitbart full-time, so....nope. 

>You're making a lot of logical leaps here. I'll spell some out that don't follow:

I assure you, I'm not. 

>Breitbart ""is"" the alt right, even though they've only been labeled that by outside news sources like CNN

See above. Steve Bannon has literally called it the platform for the alt-right. 

>Everyone who does identify as being an alt-righter must agree with the definition presented by a subsection of volunteer moderators on reddit.com who consider themselves part of the alt-right. 

Nope. But people using the term and identifying under it have to realize and acknowledge the other groups doing so. It's like wearing a swastika around because it ""originally was a symbol for good luck"". You cannot pretend that these other factions uniting under your banner don't exist. 

>Meanwhile, some people have been told they're part of the ""alt-right"" just because they like Trump more than Hillary and have no idea what reddit even is. 

Source???

>But if you think someone should be ""afraid"" because they're uncomfortable in the presence of black people (DISCLAIMER: yes, this is obviously a harmful and racist thought) even though there's not a malicious bone in their body, then you're a bad person.

>you can so comfortably assume that everyone at a Milo talk is this type of racist, that you might as well be able to assault them on the spot.

Unfortunately, no. I admire the effort you're putting into the conversation, but the main crux of your argument was falsely based around the idea that ""Breitbart has never claimed to be the center of the alt-right"". 

Final tip, the reason I made those jokes is because, like above, you've felt the need to be overly condescending, and continued meagerly attempting to ""predict"" what I'm going to do next.

Yes, you did heavily imply that in this entire conversation, but this does not change it? The original mission for NASA was not to go to the moon, that was eventually brought on by JFK in the 60s, it had already been around from 1915 as the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Regardless of the creation, what it does now is for the benefit of mankind. 

Are you implying the act of space exploration itself does not benefit mankind directly? If you want to go that route there is an entire Earth Observation System in place by NASA which is part of NASA Earth Science. Part of their job, as in the mission statement, is to protect the planet. They use 30 different satellites to track weather patterns, predict floods, measure soil moisture, understanding aerosols, air-quality changes and ozone trends.

> as in ""You see, all these people should not be paying $700 for a phone under any circumstances, but they just don't know any better... unlike myself.""

Or as in ""no phone is worth 700 bucks....to me"". Most of the time people don't need to expressly state that something is their opinion and not a statement of absolute fact when talking generally and informally. He almost certainly is looking down on people who he thinks overpay for devices but wouldn't everyone who thinks people are overpaying? That's what the over part of overpaying is there for.

Something certainly feels overly pedantic (and more overly literal) about this conversation.

I never did claim your ""opinion"" was invalid, I even came to agree with you that it would be good if FB did make a return and i agreed that omitting FB kind of spoiled the progression through the ""Formula"" classes, i also never wrote off as a possibility that it may return at a later date if there's enough demand there.

>I am saying - very clearly, very simply - that this is a trend in his sound that started way back. It is not new.

You seem to be someone who is just recently discovering Eminem. I'll tell you why. When SSLP came out it was controversial, and vulgar. You can try and find some instances of ""pop"" formats throughout the album and you might find ONE in My Name Is, but it's not a ""pop song"" as the songs on Recovery are. You saying this is a trend that his been going on, is ridiculous because it doesn't distract from the fact that his older albums were less poppy, and his newer albums are a lot more poppy. Some people don't enjoy stuff that is extremely mainstream. Sure, after all these albums have been released over his extensive career, you can say ""I see a trend where his albums have been getting more poppy"" but your point is essentially ""I can spot some instances of pop formatting on one or two songs in SSLP, thus no one should dislike Recovery for being being full of mainstream pop singles.""

> The term could easily be applied to your twisted logic of applying standards for peer review publication to blogs.

Why do you keep repeating this whole ""peer reviewed"" mantra? I honestly have no other explanation for your misuse of the concept of peer review other than your misunderstanding of the concept. Do you know that citing a source does not make it peer reviewed? I say this not to be condescending, but because all I have said in all my posts is that if you make a claim you have to have a source. From that you think I require everything to be peer reviewed? I can't comprehend that leap in reasoning, I think you must then not understand how either peer review works or what qualifies something as peer review.

TL;DR If anyone via any medium makes a fact based claim they have to be able to back up that claim with a source that supports their claim.

>Except that he put up 11 more steals at the major league level in 2010 than he did in 2009.

That's misleading; McCutchen stole 11 more in a longer season. I count 27 steal attempts in 217 chances in 2009 and 43 attempts in 270 chances in 2010. That's a 15.9% steal attempt rate in 2009 and 12.4% in 2010 (For comparison, CC's is 25.7%). Not that it matters for this guy's fantasy league (many of mine use SBN), but his success rate was 76.7% in 2010 vs 81.5% in 2009. But, whatever, it's clear that he attempted to steal more in 2010 than 2009, but he needs to run quite a bit more to get 15 more stolen bags next season.

> If only OBP were important to a base-stealer, since McCutchen's has trumped Crawford's for the last 2 seasons.

No need to be condescending. In the frame of when I spoke about CC's BA I wasn't talking about stealing opportunities, I was responding to you saying that McCutchen is CC lite, but CC has more value for fantasy because he has more BA. I'm the first in line to say that CC is overrated because his career OBP is a pedestrian .337, you won't get any arguments from me there. But it's important to note that while McCutchen's K% dropped, which is nice, his OBP was identical to his rookie effort. His BABip went from .327 to .311. The minors don't track that rate, so I don't know what is closer to his ""real"" BABIP (plus, if you've ever been to minor league games, half of the infielders can't throw any speedy runner out, and you stop wondering why people have insane batting averages in the minors). 

Rotoprofessor uses fangraphs for reference, so I don't think that's reassuring whatsoever on who is right. After reading further, though, I see that B-R includes LD that reach the OF in HR/FB and fangraphs doesn't. I... don't really know which is ""right"", I'd have to do more research on it. But I do know that by B-R, the leaguewide HR/FB is 7.3%. I dunno, 10% doesn't seem that insane, but it obviously could be a little high, but I do note that he hit 0 IFFB last season, which helps him sustain a higher rate. I guess let's look into it more.

I'm referencing HTO for these stats. In 2010, he hit 18 HR with an average distance of 397.6 ft. He hit 6 JE HR (2 lucky), 8 PL HR, 3 ND and 1 no data. Only 6 were at home. So he's hitting the ball plenty far, but getting burned by his home park, as you were saying. 6 at home out of 18 is kind of scary, to be honest, but that's identical to Adrian Gonzalez's home/road splits for his career, so I'm not sure if it's necessarily bad, it just means he probably won't hit 25 HR. And his K% decreasing seems bad, but then again, McCutchen did exactly that and it was improvement as opposed to luck? Why is McCutchen's K% decreasing sustainable while Posey's decreasing is not? I know you'll point to that Posey's K% is compared to AAA and McCutchen's is compared his rookie season. I wish I could look up swing% rates from the minor leagues, but from the eyeball inspection, it looks like Posey is just swinging and making contact more, as reflected in the lower BB% and K% (that makes sense if you consider that many of his strikeouts may have been looking), but I'm actually just thoroughly convinced that I don't know enough to make a real conclusion now.

Well, I guess we're missing out a big part; where are you placing McCutchen for 2011 on your draft charts? Is it above Posey? I think McCutchen will produce more, but at a far more plentiful position. Do you think it averages out? LPP puts Posey at $14 and McCutchen at $16 for that guy's league, which includes BB's, and [for a 9-hitter league with OPS (like a few of mine)]( http  it puts Posey at $19 and $10, all using CAIRO projections."

"> It’s like you don’t know where the term ‘Baby Boomer’ comes from.

Uh, I do, thanks. Maybe try sparing me the condescending tone and we’ll have a more productive conversation here. The government has expressed aspirations to increase increase immigration to put population growth on a trajectory towards 100 million. That is significantly in excess of the growth required to subsidize the OAS/CPP payments of baby boomers.

Admitting a “boom” of immigrants to pay for the pensions of “baby boomers” doesn’t really work considering many of them are above 40, and will eventually need significant funding for their healthcare and pension costs as well. 

If you have a point to make, you aren’t articulating it very well. 

> Immigrants are net contributors to the country

And like anything in this world, you can have too much of a good thing. We can still offset a declining population and subsidize boomer pensions with two thirds of the immigration we have currently. 

Immigrants are a net positive in GDP terms, sure, but when each Canadians’ slice of that pie becomes smaller, I’m not sure where the value is to enriching the life of each Canadian. Real estate has become unaffordable to Canadians largely because of immigration, and it has caused wages to stagnate over the last two decades.

Oh, I’m sorry. Was that supposed to be some powerful argument or something? It was a banal comment so I treated it as such. You may not want to have kids, but I and many Canadians do. However, we can’t because immigrants have largely inflated real estate to the point of where many can’t afford day care, commuting costs and a mortgage all at once. Stagnated wages don’t exactly help, either.

"I think the first question is why are we focussing our attention on computer science? What is so special about it as there are many male dominated fields that no one is complaining about women not being in. The answer that slips out is that it is a lucrative field and that is it. No one is complaining about physics, maths or economics.

> And you believe that they ""freely choose"" other majors absent of any larger societal context that pressures men to do certain things, and pressures women to do certain things, because of ingrained, subconscious sexist stereotypes, either because you believe these societal forces don't exist (why would you? you're not a woman so you wouldn't have experienced them) or because you believe they're not important and don't have any influence on people.

There are far many more factors than just societal pressure that decide what people pick in life. In this paragraph you have contradicted yourself by saying that society pressures men to do certain things while at the same time ""wouldn't have experienced them"". You cannot have it both ways. 

Personally I believe societal pressures are a factor that goes along with socio economic status, the things they generally enjoy, ability, friendships they form, family influences, prior schooling. I think these are all a factor and attributing it to just sexist expectations is just too easy and quite lazy. I have heard that even at a few months old, male babies tend to fixate on objects while females tend to fixate on faces.

There are many things that society frowns upon women doing that they have fought for or do: the vote, breast feeding, getting in to corporate jobs, 'freeing the nipple', slut walks, drug use, getting tattoos... The women I have generally met have been quite self determined and did whatever they wanted to. 

Lastly reasoning like this actually ignores the voices of women in the industry and condescendingly promotes the views of Women's Studies majors over them. How about actually asking women that do work in computer science what their experiences are? There are a diverstiy of experiences from the industry bending over backwards to pay them more and accomodate them to others experiencing some sexism. 

> Why do women opt out of these careers? You can either believe there's something innate in women that makes them unsuited to computer science, or that there's some outside influence acting on women, but not men, to influence them to choose other careers.

Again you have constructed a false dichotomy. There could be several factors beyond just sexism or even innate ability. One woman I know is top tier but opted out of the technical work because she prefered to work in other parts of the company. She is still in tech, so it cannot be hostile to women but felt better suited to other work. 

Another case was a woman working as a video game artist. She just did not like the lack of work life balance and resigned. The company did everything they could do to keep her but she said she wanted more time to herself and left. 

> If it's about an innate gender difference in ability, we'd see that in standardized test results, and while there is still a gender gap in math test results, it is closing. But even more telling, even girls who are proficient in math still don't choose computer science at the rate boys do.

You could say the same thing about boys in teaching, or boys in child care or anything else. The fact is that men generally pursue careers that are higher paying often at the sacrifice of personal happiness, what they really want to do, work life balance and safety to name a few. Being able to provide for a family is a big part of what men see as having to offer. 

I think there may be some value to the idea that when women join a field, the wages go down but in computer science something else happend. As computers became highly profitable men strated joining in large numbers. 

What about the gender gap in English that puts women 3 years ahead of men? Or that universities are now mostly female? Isn't this also a problem?

> So there's something else going on. Some studies strongly suggest it's a perception among girls that they would not be welcome in that industry. The evidence in the latest lawsuit against Google for gender discrimination supports that perception being based in reality. And studies such as this one support the idea that sexist stereotypes are keeping women out of the field.

Where is this perception coming from? Is it even true? Or is it isolated pockets? Is people saying that imbalance in computer science is only due to sexism making things worse?

I think the things you mentioned and the link you posted (very interesting read but it is not at all a study, it's a blog post) are factors, but saying they are the ONLY factor is a stretch. Some kind of survey of women who would have chosen compsci but for that reason chose something else would be needed to prove this. 

But if you honestly want to do so, do it across all professions for both men and women. You can't just cherry pick the nice jobs where you want equality and leave out the jobs you don't want. 

If you look up the recent story about the 130 tonne 'fatberg' (congealed oil, sewage and fat) that has to be cleared from the sewers by hand, every single picture is of a male. With offshore oil rig work, it is over 99% male although the story of one woman who worked on one was positive  http  ."

Yes, I'm serious, because I was talking about the story about Jones talking to Lyon, and nothing else. 

>Can you acknowledge the fact that this story did not source at Infowarz as you mistakenly asserted? If you are unable to do that, we are absolutely done here.

Sure, but you're essentially creating a straw man here. My assertion (as I state above) was not that infowars brought on this news for the first time, but that the story of Lyon and Jones talking is the story. But please, continue to be rude for no reason whatsoever. 

>What part of my impassioned defense and repeated assertions of same leads you to the preposterous conclusion that I know that my ""analogy falls flat"".

Because you're comparing apples and unicorn excrement. You're comparing things so drastically different, that it's just pointless. 

>It took me 10 seconds to find a better source of information on this particular story (which you propped up as an example of information that Infowarz broke). This is my point. Can you not grok it?

Remember how I said you're a prick and condescending? 

I never said Infowars is a good source of information, if anything, I've said the exact opposite throughout my posts. All I said from the beginning was that down voting something without even LOOKING at the content is stupid. He says that she can have the floor, yet, doesn't give her the floor. But I happen to be very fond of Lyon's work, so a unique interview with her I will still give it a chance, rather than immediately discredit it because it comes from a source I don't care for. I wasn't saying that infowars broke the news about CNN's garbage, I was saying that this story about their interview is unique to his site.

You should really take some communication classes (or anger management classes) and learn how to communicate with others. Being an asshole to me doesn't make your point any more valid, it just makes you look like an ass. To be honest, you act no better than Jones in your posts, so I don't see why you even dislike him so much, you're both abhorrently brash.

If you are bored, scroll through the five months of my posting history and see how many times I reference how much I hate Jones. We agree with each other, yet you're a giant ass to me for suggesting that you not just blow a segment off because of the source, instead of taking what you can from it."

"\> I don’t think that’s a good argument on why it SHOULDN’T be fixed. 

I don't see anyone in this comment chain saying it shouldn't be fixed. I think it's poking at how over\-the\-top that original post is. See below:

\> having an unskippable animation between games feels incredibly frustrating 

and

\> Blizzard PLEASE remove the unskippable ""Season Chest"" animation 

Complaining that the two\-second animation is ""incredibly frustrating"" is only going to make people roll their eyes. Telling Blizz to outright remove the animation is not a good idea, and a gross overreaction.

\>You’d be lying if it couldn’t be better. 

I also agree. See above.

Multiple points here. First; prior to your post in the comment chain, no one said it shouldn't be fixed. They pointed out it was a minor detail. Second, the argument from OP could have been a lot better, and much more practical. That's what a lot of people are getting at.

">no it does not. nobody and nothing has the right to the body of another.

But it has a right to its own life, and infringing on that right to life is murder. I understand if you don't agree but as this point you're just refusing to understand. It's not that complicated. I believe all human have rights unto themselves, including unborn children.

>and it is not a ""baby"" until it reaches the point of viability (The point at which it could be born and survive without the aid of modern medical technology) - prior to that it is a zygote then a fetus. not a baby.

That's just not true. Fetus definitionally means an unborn baby, and medically is only used to refer to development and not rights status. The viability line was chosen by legislators as the line at which we can define the baby as being separate and therefore protectable by law, it's a legal compromise, it doesn't speak at all to development. You're conflating all the pro choice arguments together into one, I used to be pro choice I recognize this speech.

And clearly I disagree with the legal compromise reached and think it is ill defined so I'm not exactly going to cow to a completely nonmedical definition of when life begins.

>No, I grasp your point fine. You think fetuses are super special and think that they are entitled to leech off the body for another for 9 months at great risk to that person.

Could you dial back the condescending for a second here. It's not productive. I think fetuses are human and therefore deserving of human rights protections, including the protection from being killed by those they are dependent on. It's not leeching. It's a dependent relationship. One Siamese twin is not allowed to murder the other. It being physically dependent doesn't make murder right.

To your assertion of risk, I said above that I understand medically necessary abortion and believe that should remain legal. My issue is elective abortion, and like I said above all the financial risks can be mitigated by adoption just as well as abortion. Abortion that is not medically necessary is not necessary period.

>And I have every right to think you are an oppressive religious supremacist who doesn't deserve the right to vote, but alas it is a right.

Good for you. But don't tell me I don't have the right.

And I've been religious for four years, but I didn't become pro life until my first pregnancy last year. The way you imagined my motivations is off, and frankly a lazy stereotype.

>This country is not your personal theocracy.

I didn't say it was. I said I could vote specifically because it's a democracy. I'm sorry my right to vote offends you.

>So long as your protesting doesn't include harassment and intimidation, as are the typical modus operandi of the religious supremacist.

Not actually super common in pro life circles. When I was pro choice I read all about the awful pro life boogeymen, but now within the movement is can see how ridiculous it was. The majority of pro life organizations work for birth control and adoption and legislative reform.

>Yes you do, I have a better idea - how about you stop obsessing what other people do with their bodies, and stop trying to deny them the right to control what happens to their bodies

Again, I'm not trying to oppress women. I'm trying to protect child murder. You are refusing to understand that and painting it as every other motivation under the sun. I see children being murdered and feel upset and you call that obsession?

>and instead focus on promoting comprehensive sex education - as that is the only thing that has been ever shown to reduce abortion rates.

I do, but I'll also continue voting, as will every other person you politically disagree with. You're going to need to get over it.

>Making abortion illegal doesn't reduce it, it just sends it underground where people die.

Making murder illegal doesn't stop murders occurring but I'm still real glad it's illegal.

>Adult lives come before 'potential lives'.

It's not potential. I'm pregnant now, well within the window for legal abortion, and my baby can already smile, dream, think, suck their thumb, and react to music. I could go kill them today with $400 and no questions asked, despite the fact that they pass every test Terry Schaivo didn't. That's a travesty, and ""potential life"" is a scientifically inaccurate propoganda meant to make people dehumanize babies.

>And you're wrong. it is a patently religious argument, and patently religious positions have NO BUSINESS in the government of the united states - as per the 1st amendment.

Tell this to my anti theist pro life father. Or the good third of activists I've met who are pro life and not religious.

You don't seem to get that religious people voting how they believe does jot constitute theocracy. Bit you trying to control how people vote is bigotry.

>Children. You keep using that word. It does not mean what you think it means. But again, you know this.

I know it means human young. And unborn babies are human young. I'm not doing things specifically to frustrate you, I'm saying things I legitimately believe. i legitimately believe unborn babies can rightfully be called children and that applying medical designations like fetus doesn't change anything about my argument at all.

>You are intentionally misusing the word as a pathetic attempt to manipulate the tone of the argument and reframe it to your advantage.

You're doing the same thing by trying to make me use the word fetus when it's irrelevant. If you have a good argument you should be able to make it without forcing everyone to use inaccurate clinical terms.

>Not according to you, not if I was a woman.

Yes, a woman has every right to be protected from murder. But, like everyone on the planet, she has no right to murder others. I've said that several times bow. You are intentionally misunderstanding me, attributing wrong motivations, and skipping over whole chunks of my argument. If you need to resort to suckerpunches like that to defend your position, maybe it isn't so solid.

And I would posit that if two people are arguing and one person wants to peacefully protest, build up resources, and vote, and the other wants to lead an armed rebellion if laws go against their position, the latter is not the reasonable half of the conversation."

So you've basically used such an absurd argument that you're using the behavior of poor people to justify your position against rich people being money-hungry crybabies.

During the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, people I worked with frequently would contest their property valuations as being too high. I thought it was absurd. The people in question were making easily$60k-$70k per year. They were not low income families. The point I was trying to make, and that you completely missed, was that people get really fucking weird when it comes to taxes. I'm talking about Johnson County residents here that I worked with - that would contest their own rising property values because in their fucked up minds it made more sense to do that than to be forced to pay higher taxes (we're talking maybe a hundred or two hundred dollars a year here).

">But I guess not everyone wants do dive into the aerodynamics and formula's of Bernoulli etc

If you're going to be slightly condescending about other people's lack of knowledge, you might want to make sure you're correct first. /u/Mike734 gave a perfectly valid explanation of how lift is generated. The upwards force of lift on the aircraft is balanced by an equal and opposite downwards force on the air. Wings accelerate air downwards, and if you integrate (mass\acceleration) over the entire airflow, your result will be the lift force experienced by the aircraft.

Now, you can also calculate the lift force by using Bernoulli's principle. Measure the air velocity at different points on the wing, then use Bernoulli to determine the air pressure at those points. Integrate the pressure over the top and bottom surface areas of the wing, take the difference, and you'll get the net lift force.

The main thing to remember - Newton's Third Law and Bernoulli's Principle aren't two different sources or mechanisms for the creation of lift. They're two different methods by which we can look at the airflow around a wing, and determine based on that flow how much lift is generated. You'll get the same answer whichever method you use.

So the real question, then, is - why does a wing induce the airflow pattern that it does?"
"> That one stat about how got beat only 3 times in man coverage over 5 games? That sounds pretty good to me.

But when you remember the context, that stat isn't very informative. Remember, Peppers wasn't used in coverage all that much to begin with, and when he was, it was usually in zone. But OP is discarding those coverage snaps and only looking at the man to man plays. Saying he only got beat 3 times in 5 games sounds great, but how many snaps per game was he actually in man coverage? I don't know. And OP doesn't tell us. But I don't think it was all that many snaps per game.

>The guy in the video showed film. I assume you won't.

Instead of being condescending, why don't you just scroll up and you would see that I already did:

>Per PFF, in three season he had 6 pass breakups and 0 interceptions when he was the primary defender, and I think that's because he struggles to find the ball in the air.
I went back to 2015 when he was used more as a traditional DB, and I see a guy who doesn't find the football. Instead Peppers tends to get really grabby when he senses the ball is in the air (which is a problem in and of itself). Example 1, example 2, example 3, example 4.

Also, at times in our defense, he'll have to play deep safety (both Church and Wilcox had to do it from time to time). Peppers wasn't asked to do it much in college, but when he did the results weren't always great..

Or, even as OP pointed out, he can get bullied by TEs at times.

And even in one of the plays that OP highlighted I don't think he deserves a free pass. Yes, it's very useful information that he was probably asked to play outside technique there. But he's covering a 260lb TE and the ball was thrown a bit behind the target. Outside technique or not, I expect a guy who OP is claiming will be able to play slot CB in the NFL to recover well enough to at least contest the catch. Instead, it's an easy completion."

It is not much more a problem than other major religions.

> It's responsible for the majority of terrorist attacks in the world

Which are such a minuscule problem that it's idiotic to spend such attention on them. Even in hard-hit countries, you're still far more likely to die driving on your morning commute in any given week than to a terrorist attack in any given year.

> all Muslim countries are shit holes

I mean, that has certainly not always been the case, so it hardly seems fair to pin that on Islam per se. The Ottomans, for example, were major players well into the 1800s (and were still around for WWI), so this isn't like ancient history. It wasn't Christianity that enriched Europe so much as superior military tech and imperialism.

The same is true of hard-line Christians and yet I see far less panic there.

">I teach English. If you want help with your reading comprehension, let me know.

Wow, an English teacher who's telling me that words can only have a single, non-ambiguous meaning? Who gave you a degree? Were they dropping acid?

Words mean what we decide they mean, and the decision is made on both sides of the equation. To quote from Lewis Carroll, 'the question is which is to be master.' 

>And if someone like my roommate has to run away from a crazy bitch who tells him not to jack off and makes him feel ashamed, I'll give him a place to crash.

Excellent job addressing the single issue that's actually somewhat ambiguous, declaring it isn't, and then changing the subject. By the way...if he's your roommate, doesn't he already have a place to crash? You know, your shared living space? 

Yes, no one here thinks your roommate wasn't dating a crazy, uptight bitch. But that's not the impetus behind every single person who doesn't want their sex life out in the open. Not every private person is your roommate. And not everyone wants information about their trip to the fetish prom shared.

I notice you left out any mention of your self-congratulatory atheist ramblings, or your condescending bullshit about 'getting older'. Do you also teach a class in intellectual dishonesty? Because if you don't, you could. I'd certainly take it.

You're probably a perfectly nice person, in person. It sounds like your roommate is lucky to have you around. And yet, your words have been full of anger from the very first time I suggested you consider the feelings of others, and full of self-satisfaction from the moment you asserted that your version of atheism is superior to mine. You want to know the great thing about atheism? The non-existent god doesn't give a shit about who disbelieves in him more strongly.

This is what reading is. It's reading what you think a particular string of words mean. Language is fluid, and open to interpretation. Or did you cut that class, when you were getting your teaching degree?

Here you're seeking to force somebody into something that's innately mutual. It does not matter what the circumstances are, it doesn't matter what feelings develop, It doesn't matter what party A expects from party B, you do not have the authority to govern somebody else's actions or emotions.

>The western world should just ban Muslim garments all together

----

>Banning clothing because you don't like a message it supposedly sends is essentially censorship of freedom of expression

So you're completely wrong. The conversation was specifically talking about censorship of clothing, until you randomly butted in with weird shit about ""censoring murder"".

>And I said I had no problem in censoring other peoples rights to kill in the name of religion.

Congratulations? No one here was talking about that because a) it's not censorship by any rational definition and b) everyone here just took it as a given that murder is wrong, you were the only one that felt the need to self-righteously point it out.

">When I say pro-choicers fail to understand the pro-life position, I'm not referring to its intellectual underpinnings but rather to the moral aspect. 

I'm still going to have to disagree, I'm afraid. Like I said, if you believe that a fetus is an innocent human person, pro-choice people understand that you have a moral obligation to fight as hard as you can to save them. Really, the vast majority of pro-choice people get this. 

I still think you're lending too much weight to the vocal minority of attack dogs in the movement. I mean, if I judged the pro-life movement based on the people waving signs in the street or getting into heated arguments online, then I'd be forced to conclude that they have no understanding of the pro-choice side and have closed their minds to any possibility of pro-choice people operating in good faith. 

>They're dumbfounded when a woman comes out and says she's pro-life and they call her a traitor to the feminist movement or what have you. Many pro-choicers - though not all, I shouldn't paint with such a broad brush - simply shut down when you say you're pro-life and assume that you're a misogynist or a lunatic conservative Christian. 

Yeah, that's a really broad brush there, and rather condescending to boot. It's not like pro-life women are a rarity or something surprising to the pro-choice side. 

Die hard fighters for a cause always mentally shut down when presented with the ""enemy"". That's just a human thing. It doesn't matter if we're talking about abortion, YEC, communism, or Islam, there are always people on both sides who are completely closed to the idea that their opponents could possibly be moral or have any valid ideas. 

If a woman is personally pro-life for herself, then that's perfectly fine from a feminist perspective. The only problem occurs is when a woman is trying to get the State to force all other women to be pro-life as well. That's really where the misogyny and ""treason"" charges come in (not that they are automatically justified). When she is literally attempting to use the State to force others to conform to her beliefs, that will unfortunately result in a great deal of knee-jerk anger. 

>You and I are closer to agreement than you'd think. I'm not full-blown pro-life, I'm okay with abortion in cases of rape, incest, and the potential to cause serious harm or death to the mother. 

No, I actually thought that we shared a ton of overlap in our beliefs on the subject, and it does seem I'm not wrong. Very, very few people are full-blown pro-life. Virtually everyone has at least some exception that makes abortion morally permissible. 

>And, to be honest, I don't think pro-life laws should be put in place right now. I don't think, in the end, we should allow people to arbitrarily take the life of their child in the womb (and that's a totally separate discussion). But you're right that there are so many socioeconomic factors at play and we need to solve those problems first. 

Personally, I'm opposed to it being illegal, although there are many cases where I would feel comfortable calling abortion to be immoral. 

Personally, I see fighting to improve systemic socioeconomic problems to be absolutely integral to reducing abortions, and far more effective than mere legislation. I really, truly want to work with pro-life people to reduce abortions. I merely strongly disagree that legislation is an effective or moral way to work towards that goal. 

>However, when/if we do get to a point where no one needs an abortion for a non-medical reason, I would be much more vocal in arguing for outlawing it. For now, I would rather it be illegal, but abortion is doing about as much good as evil in the world, so I don't think it should be at the top of the agenda when we've got so many much more pressing issues. 

To be honest, I'm an anarcho-communist, and I'm always open to rethinking how we look at conception, pregnancy, miscarriage, motherhood, feminism, birth, and abortion. I think we'd have to fundamentally re-order society in order to make true progress towards eliminating reasons for non-medical abortion, but if we ever reach that stage I wouldn't be shocked to have people consider deliberate elective abortion to be homicide.

Yea, sometimes, but 9/10 of these decisions that result the way you're talking about are social issues, and not economic ones that come from a progressive not regressive side.


>For example, Trump's canceling DACA seems like a bad idea to progressives short-term, but it will actually force the issue to get addressed. The alternative was really Dreamers being left in limbo - possibly for years - had Trump done nothing and allowed the status quo to continue.

The DREAMER's weren't in Limbo. They were safe until Trump ended it. The reason Trump ended it was to use the lived of hundreds of thousands of hard working, tax paying Americans who were brought here as children as a bargaining chip to get Wall funding. 

This wasn't a good natured move, this was fucking heavy handed and brutally cruel. The reason we know this is that in the last couple days it has been clear that Trump won't sign a DACA Bill without border wall funding attached. 

You're really attempting to leave out crucial facts to make a cruel move look benevolent. 

>There is a similar argument related to the tax cuts, which is seen by the fact Democrats have already changed their tune on it - initially, they said the whole idea was bad, afterwords, and after seeing polling returns and seeing how businesses and the economy are already reacting, they changed to ""well, they aren't big enough/permanent/give too much to big corporations"". But the truth is that our tax system is/was LOOOONG overdue for changes, and still needs more changes, but this is at least a step.


This actually undermines your entire point. Companies gave some bonuses out (while firing thousands of workers) and people's checks went up slightly. This causes people to like it in the short term.

However, these tax cuts have long term effects that won't be felt for awhile. For instance, the corporate tax breaks are permanent, the one's on citizens are temporary. In fact after 10 years most people will be paying MORE in taxes. 

Also, it severely balloons our debt by 1.5 trillion dollars. This has caused Republicans to already decide and start talking about cutting back on beneficial social programs in the near future to pay for them. 

There's also the fact that the economy is growing right now at a solid pace. However, because of how economies work, we are due for a recession here in the near future. Pre-firing on stimulus type tax cuts which would help boost the economy in the short term during a recession makes it harder for us to crawl out of one when it does hit.

So this actually undermines the entire point you're trying to make in that it's semi-popular in the short term but with terrible consequences down the line.

>Another one which is less what Trump has done and more a result of him being elected: Libertarians have talked for years about the dangers of too much executive power (the dreaded ""Imperial Presidency"" that really came into its prime with Bush and grew with Obama), but neither side really cared. Neocons liked that Bush could make boom-boom on the other side of the world, and Democrats thought that the White House was going to be Blue from now on. No one cared about the power of the Presidency...


>...until Trump became President and started with his Executive Orders. Now we have liberal courts supporting the idea of States' Rights!

Your entire point here is that Trump is so bad of a President that we'll curtail the Executive's Power. You're saying people will not look at him favorably, they will go ""Wow, he was so bad we need to make sure if anyone like him gets into Office again they'll have less power.

The funny thing is that this is just your political opinion about the Executive Branche's power (and I'm guessing Government power on the whole) and not good decisions made by this administration.

Once again, you're arguing against your point that he will be looked at favorably in the future.


>But, again, the point is that things that are objectively great are very very difficult to really say in the moment, because in the moment, emotions are too charged and ideology is too powerful. We can all look back at, say, Bush Sr raising taxes and say, NOW, nearly 30 years later, that it was a good idea...

>...but who, AT THE TIME, would have said or agreed to that? Not many.


You're literally counter arguing your tax cuts point in real time. Tax cuts are popular at the moment, bad for the future. Tax raises tend to have the opposite effects.

>So no one is going to be able to convince you, right now, that Trump has made or is making good decisions. You either think that already or you don't. It'll be this way for you for a decade or two, just like it will for everyone else.

You're taking the only route to be able to say ""He'll just seem awful for 10 to 20 years past his Presidency. Then people MIGHT think he was alright."" Do you understand why this is a stretch, purely hypothetical and a ridiculous point to be making. 

>There's a reason that history tends to judge leaders (like Presidents) very differently than they were judged in their own time. Those who were popular in their time are often judged harshly by history (more harshly than the academics and media of the time who fawned over them judged them), while many (though not all - it's not an iron-clad rule) that were unpopular in their own time are seen by historians as not all that bad, and sometimes doing important things - which generally is why they become unpopular. Indeed, Obama will likely be judged more harshly by history. However, this does not mean that Trump WILL be judged more positively, either - as I say, it's not an iron-clad rule or some weird inverse relationship. :)


Aaaaaaand at the end you go full monty. ""The last Democratic President will be judged more harshly by History but this Conservative one will be looked at greatly.""

You've taken awhile to type this out, I get that. But your arguments are terrible and boil down to ""You just don't know any better for 20 years."" Which is condescending as hell and also hypocritical because you end your last point by saying that Obama will be looked at worse in the future.

Your condescending attitude isn't conducive to discussion.

> I'm following Fromm's theory of cultural anthropocentricism.

Which is itself not widely accepted.

>A cultural relativist would begin his thought with the axiom that there is no such thing as universal truth, therefore all ""truth"" is merely subjective opinions of different people.

No, cultural relativism holds that all constructs of truth are subjective. That doesn't preclude the possibility of universal truths

> First of all this is contrarian with any and all theories that would attempt to alter the establishment, which can not from this context be viewed as fallible.

No, its not. The notion that values are subjective and cultural constrained doesn't prevent one from altering the establishment nor does it render the underlying principles of a system infallible. Such an interpretation completely misses the point. Actors within a society are perfectly capable of changing its basis and have historically done so regardless of whether or not cultural relativism is valid. Furthermore, the fact that something is subjective by no means renders it beyond criticism. People have desires, they have moral systems, if a system doesn't align with those subjective views then people will view the system as flawed.

>The attempt to alter your society is then always arbitrary since your system of values -that make you want this reform- is inherently contradictory with your society's system of values, and your society is the only acceptable frame of orientation for any evaluatory process. 

laugh That is an absurd statement. No system of values or attempt to alter the system is arbitrary. They form out of particular circumstances and are sustained by an internal logic which is visible assuming one is familiar with those circumstances and the larger cultural context they entail. Society isn't the only acceptable ""frame of orientation"" for evaluating the system's basis. Quite the contrary, transcultural interaction and disconnects between one's day to day realities and the larger precepts of an establishment offer a basis from which counter-establishment position can be formed.

>From the cultural relativist point of view, you are always the insane one if you don't accept the establishment, and it is not very peculiar that this theory was used primarilly by capitalist sociologists and psychologists to justify their system.

That is not only nonsense but historically ignorant as well. Cultural relativism emerged in a era where social evolution and racialization were the predominant norms. It was a revolutionary notion that stood very much in the face of the existing Capitalist structure. It remains one of the primary tools used by post-colonial historians, anthropologists, and indigenous activists to critique Capitalism.

>That person can only be insane since the society he attempts to fight can only be sane, and is in fact the essence of truth for its members.

That is a ridiculous statement. You've taken the notion that truth is constructed and perspectival and warped it into a defense of universal truth as prescribed by the upper class. 

>Cultural anthopocentricism is based exactly on human nature, i.e. the specific inherent qualities, urges and instruments that dictate human behaviour. What is sane is sane because it is compatible with human nature. 

What are you talking about? Cultural anthropocentrism is the process by which certain scientific realities of the human condition and position within nature are distorted by a culture and humans are instead placed as the most important feature of life. Cultural anthropocentrism is something to be avoided, not embraced. Its akin to you saying ""I am an ethnocentrist! Unlike all those stupid leftists who think you have to consider the viewpoints of non-Westerns, my view point is real because it is based on REAL history: the history of western white males!""

> From this point of view societies are not equal. They may be more or less compatible with human nature, and if they are less then they must be overthrown and be replaced by one that is more so. 

That is hilarious. Human history already has a chapter on overthrowing ""unequal"" societies that weren't compatible with human ""nature"". You know, spreading ""civilization"" via genocide and slavery?

>What is insane is insane because it is incompatible (capitalism may claim to be based on human nature but that is debatable, and marx considers aspects of human behaviour like competitiveness acquired and naturalised)

And here we come to heart of the issue and the single statement which renders your entire position incorrect. You have inadvertently acknowledge that human nature is not a self-evident, universally agreed upon truth. It is something to be debate, evaluated, and continually redefined. It is subjective. Not only does this reinforce the validity of cultural relativism but so does it reflect terribly on you. You're resting the accuracy of your definition of human nature on the work of a single of man who lived centuries ago before the advent of modern science. When people still thought the universe was permeated by aether and many scientists still believed that sperm contained little, preformed humans. Your entire argument not only flies in the face of hundreds of years of anthropological research (to say nothing of other disciplines but so does it forward a terrifying degree of absolutism. Your talk about Stalinism yet it was precisely the idea that anyone who dissented from how human nature was understood within Marxism that lead to mass-oppression and execution.

>From this point of view what is considered moral or ethical or just in a specific society is not necessarilly what is. While in that case morality would change from society to society and from era to era, anthropocentricism views morality, ethicality and justice as something tied to the unchangeable human nature and therefore static itself, therefore what changes is only the perception of each society for these concepts. Then it is the obligation of each individual to find the truth about them, and then of the collective to create a society that reflects them.

Thats nice. Its a point of view. Really, you haven't invalidated anything I've said. You've demonstrated that it is subjective, critiqued it on grounds that are self-referential and then made some grandiose declarations about what humans are and are not obligated to do. There are indeed some trends which appear to be universal to the human condition that are ground in our evolutionary conditions. But none of them provide grounds to take humanity in the horrifying direction you're suggesting here. Something is considered natural and universal when it is observed in all circumstances, regardless of varying factors. This idea that you're forwarding - that certain values and behaviors are universal and natural but aren't observed by every society - is internally contradictory. If a moral precept or mode of social organization isn't observed by everyone, it isn't universal. If a particular behavior or attitude must be taught or encouraged, it isn't natural. Your entire viewpoint is the epitome of what I have mentioned earlier: every system gains its legitimacy by portraying its subjective values as natural and universal. Its ability to suppress dissident viewpoints and maintain its supremacy is continent on the masses wholly believing all other ways of behavior are unnatural. This is no different than what you're pushing for here.

>I don't consider them subjective for the aforementioned reason...my views on morality and justice happen to follow the enlightenment's train of thought (of which marxism is also a child), with morality tied to rationality and justice to the practical conciliation of conflicting rights.

laugh No. Your views don't ""happen"" to follow the Enlightment's course of development. They adhere to the bourgeois values of the Enlightenment precisely because you are a product of Western society. A society which relies on its masses endorsing certain fundamental notions in order to retain its legitimacy. The irony of this is that your worldview is actually guilty of the very thing you're accusing cultural relativism of: 

""you are always the insane one if you don't accept the establishment..... That person can only be insane since the society he attempts to fight can only be sane, and is in fact the essence of truth for its members.""

You are forwarding the Enlightenment values of the establishment. You are deriding me as illogical and supporting the unnatural/authoritarian because I do not embrace your line of thought.

K here's what you said: Creationists don't care about the facts or the truth. They do care. That's why they bend over backwards to cherry pick data. If they didn't care about facts then they would just say ""God did it"" and people like Ken Hamm and Kent Hovind wouldn't exist. You can't change their minds with logic or reason. Here's another absolute statement. There are countless thousands, maybe millions, of ex-creationists and ex-christians which prove this statement is a gross exaggeration. They don't believe in logic or rationality. Yes they do. They're just wrong. I assume you value logic and rationality. Are you saying that you are 100% right in everything you believe? How intellectually dishonest. They believe in belief, not facts. Their belief dictates which facts they are 'allowed' to accept. Given the right evidence shared in the right way I dare say most creationists could be righted. They believe what they believe because they want to believe it. I absolutely agree with this. Like all forms of confirmation bias, they deliberately seek out that information which confirms their worldview and reinterpret that which does not.

Winter got hosed. Yes. That is true.

I'm sorry, was Mariner the coach during Winter's time? Did I say patience with the FO? No. I did not. I said patience with the coach.

TFC FO demonstrated an impatience with Winter. Whether it was deserved or not is a secondary issue.

>Or maybe patience would have helped Nelsen force through more transfers that Bezbatchenko disagreed with?

Nelsen was a terrible coach. I don't care if you disagree. He was Toronto's biggest coaching hire mistake - including Mariner.

>Have you ever even heard about any of this?

Why do Canadian fans - especially Toronto fans - have this exceptionalist attitude, and a condescending one at that? As if not being from Toronto (or Canada) invalidates someone from forming an educated opinion? As if because your o's are often followed by u's, non-Canadians just can't comprehend the writing or games on the screen?

Seriously, get over yourself. You're not that great.

>At least an experienced coach could have maybe done better in these god awful situations.

That's an assumption unsupported by evidence.

>Winter had a full season test run to implement his tactics and bring in players and he started 0-9.

Which may mean Mariner is being used a scapegoat, even if he deserves criticism otherwise.

>Nelsen had a full season and a half to do whatever he wanted and he was averaging like 35% possession when we let him go.

Again, worse hiring decision TFC ever made.

>Heaps made the playoffs in his 2nd year

Good thing NE was patient with him and let him go two full years, eh?

>and so did Olsen after his first full season

Same thing. DC's front office - and fans! - were patient with their rookie coach.

(See a trend here that doesn't exist in Toronto?)

> It's a little easier to be ok with being bad when you know your coach has it in him.

Who knows what, now?

I believe faith in a new coach and willingness to endure a bad season or two is more important than some sort of knowledge (via divination, apparently,) that a new coach will deliver results.

>The situations are just not comparable for so many reasons

There's that exceptionalism again!

>I'm not surprised you compared them because you don't know the reasons because you don't follow TFC.

There are those assumptions again!

>So please spare me the history lesson on my own team.

I think maybe you need to not wear your TFC-tinted glasses so tightly. And realize that the soccer world is larger than BMO field, that the Canadian press and fan voice doesn't stop at the border, and realize that maybe - just maybe - you're trying really hard to rationalize getting rid of yet another coach by inventing some justification to do so.

Just look around at the top-performing teams in the league. They have stability at the top.

Maybe you can't fix your front office shenanigans overnight, but you can certainly fix your attitude and be on the patient side regarding the coach. He's already got an uphill fight dealing with your FO - the last thing he needs is for you to be all knee-jerky because you've suddenly grown impatient.

That impatience doesn't go away just because you hire a new coach. I thought you'd learn that after 8 years."

"> I'm calling bullshit.

I'll see and raise. You're ascribing attributes to me that aren't there, and keeping right up with that condescending tone you love so much. Douche level 11, buddy, tone it down a notch.

I'm not trying to shoehorn any beliefs down anyone's throats -- study up on atheism sometime to understand that it actually represents an absence of belief.

No, I do not want to force my belief system down people's throats. I firmly believe that a good, firm grasp of history, humanities, the arts, some basic tenets of math and the sciences, etc., can lead the human brain away from the desire or need for superstition and this burning urge to violently attack anyone who believes differently. I hold no gun to anyone's head, I make no threats, and I suggest only that giving people something better to do than just killing each other might make us all better off. Isn't that similar to what most of the religions actually say in their texts?

> You keep saying ""something"" needs to be done to stop the violence. What?

Education. Public works and welfare efforts. Projects to give restless, otherwise bored people something productive to do that can inspire pride instead of this bitterness, anger, and rage that seethes inside. Politically, there's always the notion of ""compromise"" instead of standing firm on all points (because when Isreal and Palestine don't compromise, they end up with outsiders involved because they just keep on killing each other, and the rest of us think that kinda sucks).

> For someone complaining about crimes against humanity you sure don't seem to have a problem with violating them when it suits you.

What crimes against humanity am I proposing? Are you even capable of speaking without hyperbole, or do you just love turning every word into another strawman?

> You don't get to respectfully disagree with history because it would be convenient for your argument. The Crusades were started for the same reason the Jews and Muslims are fighting right now in Palestine: control over the holy land and its resources.

Can you take a quick look at two words you wrote there? Hint: they're ""holy"" and ""land."" They were fighting over a holy land. That's as textbook as it gets as far as ""fighting over religion"" versus ""fighting over resources."" Both Muslim and Catholic faiths believe Jerusalem is an important, holy place, and it really pisses them both off that the other has any of its people there. That's an entirely religious conflict there.

> WW2 wasn't blatantly fought over resources.

Nearly six million people belonging to one ethnic and religious background just happened to stand in the way. Got it. Their descendants will sure be glad to hear it was all just an unfortunate side-effect.

> Frankly, pointing out that you are being a blatant bigot doesn't make my tone nasty.

No, the rest of your words do that for you. ""Silly assertion."" ""What makes your beliefs so special?"" ""Read it. Understand it. Learn from it."" Douchechills up to factor 12, you're really up to speed now! Don't talk down to me. Discuss with me. I'm trying to keep it civil (despite a couple of cracks here and there given your churlish attitude) but you're trying to provoke anger instead of actually dealing with anything.

You've defined bigotry, but you've yet to explain how the term applies to me. I've suggested that helping relieve pressure in the middle east by encouraging people to look for something besides religion to drive everything they do is a way to help solve this problem. That's not bigotry. That's constructive advice. 

""Hey, maybe you guys shouldn't get that bent out of shape about the land ... worship it, worship on it, try to get along with that other group that wants to do the same thing. Your god(s) would probably be happier seeing you worship in harmony than spilling each other's blood on holy soil."" What's bigoted about that?

Religion has been responsible for many atrocities and nastiness. You can't hide from that or avoid it by calling me ""bigoted"" for pointing it out.

> If you are not willing to tolerate the beliefs of others, why should they tolerate yours?

Who says I don't tolerate the beliefs of others? I tolerate them every day. I do it, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Has political correctness gotten to you so badly that even criticizing behavior based on its religious roots offends you? These people are killing each other over a resource because their religions tell them that's what's right. Without that religious piece in the picture, much of the conflict wouldn't be there. I'm sure people would find other reasons to fight (humans always do -- look at you and I), but it'd sure be nice to see at least one excuse fall by the wayside, wouldn't it?"

"I don't think you understand where i am trying to get with this. 

Lore is a term that has been painfully misused,Lore is the knowledge pertaining to 1 particular piece of work, which usually a group of followers is the only one that actually carries that torch. 

This is only necessary for worlds that are COMPLETELY alien, think Warcraft, Lord of the rings, Dragon age, Mass effect, Diablo, even avatar. 

These are worlds that slowly take you up to pace because other wise nothing will make sense, you are not expected to be ruled by your logic, but the logic of that world. 

Star Vs and Rick and Morty are NOT this, both of them expect you to apply the same logic behind your every day life to them because they more or less take place on the setting that we live on, plain ol earth, even when they are NOT actually on earth, like say, another dimension or just an alien planet. 

Heck, especially so in Rick and Morty's case, where practically all of it's humor depends heavily on the human factor of it's audience. 

yes, Both Star and Rick and Morty have a few events that do not happen on screen and are supposed to have importance, but they are few and far between, and what hasn't been unveiled yet is very likely to be showcased somewhere down the road. 

They are not high fantasy, do not mistake stated canon with lore. 

Star Vs. in particular seems to be pretty centered in it's plot line, and not with the world around it.

> I HIGHLY doubt that Harmon and Roiland had every piece of plot points and world building mapped out from the very beginning. And yet the show still manages to explore many fascinating worlds many of which has their own sets of culture and laws.

Of course they did not, that is precisely why it isn't high fantasy. You may see these new and exciting worlds that only work in a superficial way in the space of 1, may-haps two episodes, but they rarely, if ever, matter in the long run. 

Rick and Morty lives in the moment, that is perfectly fine, but it doesn't indulge in any real world building. 

Star Vs, is very centered in it's plot, and rarely indulges in the world around it. 

Mind you, i love both shows, but they do not have very compelling worlds, mostly because that ain't what they are aiming for.

> Just because a story started out simple, doesn't mean it can't build an interesting world later on. 

Tis, true, but they are not high fantasy, it doesn't work as tightly as it should if their intent is to have people get lost in their world.

> And yet 2 seasons in we are now exploring the magic realm within the wand and even the the magic realm where the source of magic come from. 

what does that have to do with anything? the charger, or battery the wand requires has not even been mentioned again, and it is particularly jarring when the wand..somehow works on unicorns, what does the charger actually do? ugh, it torments me, since it was most likely simply a ragamuffin or a gag, but do to it's connection to one of the most important objects in the show, i would have expected them to take more care of what is stated about the wand in question. 

And it is mostly speculation whether or not they are gearing towards world building, and considering their 11 minutes episodic format, and how much they have on their plate, i personally doubt they have time for something like that. 

> Yeah, and the fact that the majority of the season 3 intro take place on Mewni means nothing eh?

Maybe? i don't know and neither do you, Tis' speculation.

>Fine, then. If that's the case then please do tell me what the purpose of episodes like Pizza Thing was? Pony Head's character arc has already been resolved in St. Olga's.

What are you talking about? what character arc? 

Pony head's character arc is most likely her own relationship with Marco, which has kind of been a theme for her since her introduction. And, this is hush hush, but according to a certain someone Pony head was most likely inspired by Sailor Moon, as in, Usagi. If this is true, Pony head's relationship with Star and Marco is kind of important.

Even more so if this proves true. 

I like Marco's dynamic with Pony head, and i am fairly certain that was the entire point of the episode, and you can also see a change in Pony head's attitude towards Marco. All the problems she causes during the episode are not born out of malice or any negative intention at all, it is simply Pony head being her vivacious, reckless and annoying self. Pony head willing to treat Marco with certain dignity already speaks volumes, and after the episode they actually started getting along...somewhat. and it shows, considering Pony head was willing to cry in Marco's shoulder for comfort in the bounce lounge.


>Right, because having no development is better than having SOME development. Is that what you're saying? Gotcha. 

What development is there to have? Jackie is a regular girl that doesn't associate with Star often, her whole purpose revolves around her relationship with Marco, are you eager to watch two teens on the flowery start of their relationship? i certainly am not. 

Sides, what makes you think Jackie is even gonna have development? She really isn't that interesting for the most part and the whole purpose of her character could have been to give Star a rude awakening to feelings. 

Character development should be reserved for those who have real importance to the plot (for the most part anyways) and Jackies ties to the plot are considerably shaky, and now it depends entirely on what the cast wants to do with her, or what they don't want to do. 

All i am saying is you are seriously overestimating Jackie's importance in the show. I seriously doubt they are just gonna cut her off, since she seems to be an established character, but her importance as a character is seriously blown out of proportion by most of the fanbase, and this sub in particular. to the point that people almost seem to hold her in the same regard as Star and Marco, the heck?

Not necessarily, Pony head is most likely going to have importance to the plot sooner or later. So you can kind of look at her like a plot element. Think, who does Evil Lizard lawyer appeal to? i am not exactly sure, but just because he doesn't necessarily have an specific audience like Star, doesn't mean he wasn't handled properly, or provided interesting developments in the plot. 

Seems like a rather shallow complaint, if am being terribly honest.

> Tell me why you think Obamacare was good?

Millions of people have insurance that they didn't have just a couple years ago. No pre-existing conditions, no lifetime limits. A healthcare safety net for the middle class should they lose a job or need to relocate. Health insurance for part-time workers so they're not condemned to bankruptcy or death should they become seriously ill. Health insurance for people who want to work for small businesses that can't offer insurance. Baseline of minimum coverage and limits on how much profit insurance companies can make on premiums so that the middle-class and poor don't get screwed by insurance companies taking their money and giving them only the middle finger in return when they got sick. Lowest rate of healthcare price inflation in 50 years. Etc, etc, etc. There's a fuckton of positives.

Oh, and it saved my life. So there's that. I had just graduated college and was working a part-time job while I searched for full-time employment. The only way I could get insurance was through the ACA, and during that period I got diagnosed and treated for skin cancer in the earliest stage before it advanced and spread. Without the ACA, I would either have not caught the cancer at all, or caught the cancer after it had spread to other places and I got really sick or near-death. Then even if I managed to get a full-time job with insurance right afterwards, it would either be a pre-existing condition and then I just would have died, or it would have been extensive chemo/radiation treatments and surgery for me, and those expensive treatments would have brought insurance and medical costs up for everybody. 

Treating illnesses before they get worse is hugely important to keeping costs down, and that's why there's so much focus on preventive care in the ACA. Preventative care has been greatly expanded in the ACA, and I saw an article just the other day about cervical cancer being caught much earlier than it used to be due to the expansion of insurance and preventative treatments. The ACA saves lives. I'm one of them. And it will continue to save lives.

Any meaningful response you want to add, or are you just going to say the media is thinking for me and Donald J. Trump will magically fix everything? Either way, we're done. I've got better things to do than argue with Trump people on the internet."

The only ""obvious fact"" that I pointed out was that ten years of prison will change a person. If you've known anyone who's been in prison for any length of time, you will know this to be true. The extent can differ for sure, but it changes things. Not sure why you're referring to the first part of my original post when quoting the ""obvious fact"" part though, it has nothing to do with that stuff. Thanks for the condescending tone btw.

All of these petty semantics that for some reason you've taken time out to pedantically analyse detract from the actual point though, which is the assumption that such fleeting endeavours offer any kind of sense of productivity.

This doesn't even make sense. The reason I point out that his viewpoint is subjective is that firstly he stated his case in terms of facts by wildly throwing out unresearched claims about inmate activities, and then used these unsupported assertions to categorically state that these activities offer proof that a prisoner's life is fulfilling and productive. Sure my points are subjective, I never stated anything more, but at least I'm basing mine on reality and not just a bunch of unresearched assumptions. If you're actually bothered in any way to read further into the life of a typical inmate rather than just picking pointless holes in my argument, there is a wealth of supporting information (including prisoner testimonials) on the internet for you to peruse.

You told me your opinion on my parenting in a condescending and presumptuous manner.

Really, I think they are reacting to the nanny complaining. None of the other parents there with whom I have spoken have said I acted in an inappropriate manner--quite the opposite, in fact--and now three of them have expressed similar issues with the nanny.

So, given all of this, I do not think I will be apologizing. Instead, we will be approaching the school and the nanny's employer with our experiences and requesting that the nanny curb her inappropriate behavior.

> Lecture? Get off your horse, you came here asking for input.

I asked specifically for input on how to handle this in a constructive manner, and you decided to make a bunch of condescending comments about my parenting abilities instead. For example:

> The stranger bit was an example. How about, ""honey, we don't get so close to people we don't know"" or how about, ""honey, stay a little closer to daddy"" or even ""Honey, that woman is suspect and acted inappropriately around other children here and I don't want you near her."" 

It's presumptuous of you to assume that we don't talk to our kids about things like this. You're trying to invent more things to find fault with instead of sticking to the facts of the topic at hand.

> It will be difficult to teach your child appropriate vs. inappropriate if you are having such a hard time examining your own actions.

My actions were fine, and now I have the agreement of several eyewitnesses. Maybe I failed to describe the incident with enough detail, because you have filled in some perceived gaps with a bunch of supposition that has taken you way off into left field. Maybe that's my fault. Maybe you should stop though.

">I would argue that the viable argument in favor of the church that no other church has is that you can gain your own testimony of it through the spirit. Everyone, regardless of background, can obtain spiritual confirmations that the church is true that are convincing to you as an individual.

You obviously have never talked to any person of any religion who is not Mormon about why they believe their own faith. This is practically verbatim what they say. ^You ^are ^awfully ^condescending ^for ^someone ^who ^hasn't ^done ^his ^research.

Receiving a personal spiritual confirmation of the truth is the entire foundation of the Evangelical movement. The Quran has the equivalent of Moroni's promise built into it, claiming that God/Allah will manifest the truth of the Quran unto your soul after reading it.

If you don't believe me that practically every other religion makes this exact same claim about spiritual witness and testimony, just read for yourself:

 Here's a Muslim testimony of his spiritual confirmation that Islam is true.
>Quote: ""I had never in my life heard of The Holy Qur'an. I began to briefly read some pages. While I was reading I knew that what I was reading was true. It was like a slap in the face, a wake up call. The Qur'an is so clear and easy to understand. I was really impressed and wanted to know more about Islam and Muslims....After months of study and research I could not deny the truth anymore. I had put it off too long, but was still living the life I had before, and knew that if I became a Muslim I had to give all that up. One day while reading the Qur'an, I began to cry and fell to my knees and thanked Allah for guiding me to the truth.""

 Also from Islam, here's the story of an LDS member who converted to Islam by following your ""viable argument that doesn't apply to any other religion"". 
>Quote: ""...I went to a mosque. It was the first time in my life I had any encounters with Islam. I felt there the presence of God like I have never felt in my entire history of being Mormon. It was such an amazing feeling. Words can not describe this feeling. Well, such an experience would have it’s implications such as the possibility of the Church not being the fullness of the truth. So I got back from my mission and did research on my own and I found that this new religion was able to fill my soul with more light, and bring me closer to God. I found that Islam explains our purpose more clear and powerful. Converting is definitely the best choice I have made in my life.""

 Here's a man who gained his own testimony of the Lord Krishna and converted from Christianity due to this spiritual witness. 
>Quote: ""I started teaching the Bhagavad Gita in my world religions classes several years ago. It was a time of great transition in my personal life, and, as is often the case with times of transition, it was also a time of intense spiritual struggle. While I was drawing wonderful support and guidance from the Bible during this time, as I began my systematic and in-depth exploration of the Bhagavad Gita, I found myself profoundly affected by this text. Krishna’s words would stay with me, often arising spontaneously in my mind at times of crisis. They not only instilled a wonderful serenity in me, gradually they began illuminating many aspects of my life and relationship to God.... I spent countless nights there reading from the Gita, with tears of joy running down my face as I read the words of Lord Krishna and felt the presence of God.""

 Here's a testimony about how the spirit testified to another woman that she needed to become a Born Again Christian. 
>Quote: ""I got to the church and it was beautiful. I went in with my brother and sister-in- law and we sat in the front row. The service began, and I was blown away! The feeling that came over me was as if Jesus Christ was in every part of my body. I cried and cried and cried. My brother was standing next to me and he put his arms around me and said, ""Sister, everything is going to be okay. God is with you."".... Church service ended and we went out to the fair grounds. I was approached by a gentleman named Daniel who had asked me if it was okay for him to tell a story to me that had happened to him that morning. I said, ""Sure."" He proceeded to tell me that while he was getting dressed for church service a voice had told him to find his anointing oil and to take it to the church service with him. There would be someone in need of help that day. He said he looked all over for that oil and finally found it in his top drawer. He said he put it into his pocket and proceeded to go to church. He told me, ""As I pulled into the driveway and saw you, that same voice told me, 'This is the woman you need to help today.'""....After the prayer for healing was finished, I went outside to get some fresh air and ponder all that had happened, I was so overwhelmed with the presence of God. I looked up to the sky and I said, ""Jesus -- thank you so much for showing me so much love and grace, and thank you for placing your hand on me during the prayer for my healing."" Then I asked Jesus, ""Do you have a plan for me? Do you want me to serve you, and spread your gospel throughout the world?"" To my amazement, the black clouds that were in the sky came together and formed a perfect cross! I was in complete awe! I told my brother and sister-in-law what had happened and my sister-in-law confirmed that this is God's calling for me. Since that day, I have chosen to become a reborn (born again) Christian. I have been ordained and I have entered courses to learn all about the Bible, Jesus Christ, and his gospel and teachings. God has enabled me to earn my PhD, and I am looking forward to starting my own ministry.... I cannot tell you the warmth and love I feel from Jesus Christ in my home and in my life everyday. It is a delight and a miraculous feeling. I do not intend to stop here. I intend to strive on to someday plant my own church and open the doors to my own congregation and preach the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ to all.""

"> Well, that is not very libertarian.

Not very libertarian you say? How are you defining libertarian? For instance, are you taking the position that there should be no regulation whatsoever for medical practice? I've seen that around but want to make sure I know where you criticism is coming from.

>So do you generally support the excessive and prohibitive regulation of medical procedures? 

Um, no. What I support is protecting women's lives.

>Why do you think Texas fails to regulate other similarly risky or more risky medical procedures, such as, colonoscopies, vasectomies, tooth extractions or laser eye surgery?

Are you under the impression those things aren't regulated? Or are you saying Texas as an entity isn't involved in regulating them?

>It's very clear that the intent is to prohibit abortions not to protect patient safety.

That's conjecture on your part. Even if so, preventing abortions is inherently a libertarian interest (albeit one I would rather see fulfilled by getting government out of abortions rather than having the government hold those clinics to the same standards as other medical facilities).

>our answer is nothing but cynical right wing spin without the slightest hint of a libertarian perspective or influence. Would you say you are more ""pro life"" than libertarian?

That's fundamentally inaccurate. Being pro-life is the only consistent libertarian position. Would you say you are more libertine-sexuality-at-all-cost than libertarian?

If you are in fact assuming that ""libertarian"" means ""libertine-sexuality-at-all-costs"" you have failed to understand libertarianism. 

If, on the other hand, you are advocating for absolutely no regulation of the medical industry that is closer to libertarian thought but only represents one of the historic argument for a libertarian view of limited government's role in protecting citizen's basic rights within the healthcare context (and one that skews toward anarcho-capitalism which isn't necessarily a bad thing). However, there is a common and reasonably argued and held position within libertarianism that protecting basic right to life is not inconsistent with and may even necessitate some minimal level of government involvement.

Of course, you could be taking some other position than those but your lack of clarity doesn't afford an opportunity to find it.

>Do any pro-lifers have a libertarian answer?

Stop being condescending, particularly when you bring so many assumptions to the table that aren't necessarily well founded. 

The pro-life position, regardless of how a minimalist state relates to it, is the only consistent libertarian position. Protecting basic rights to liberty can only begin by protecting a person's most basic right, the right to live.

Not even close to true. There are lots of pro-gun Democrats at least within my social circle. Many of them hold the belief that if Democrats dropped gun control from their party's platform, Democrats would be almost unstoppable, and I'm inclined to agree. I think it'll take some time, but eventually we will see more pro-gun Democrats rise through the ranks.

Also, I'm not better off with the Republican party.

Please educate yourself on the nordic equality paradox. Countries like Sweden, which all recognize as the most feminist in the world, found that fewer and fewer women entered engineering.

As women were given more freedom to pursue whatever career they wished, these countries have found that they wish to enter the STEM fields at a lower rate than men do.

Women are getting more college degrees than men and are free to choose whatever major they please. They are choosing other majors. Are you saying that you know better than they do?

"You still haven’t responded to any of my questions. Wow!

>Your problem here, as I have tried to point out to you before, is that you are constructing a strawman about what feminism is.

I am not. In fact, if anything, I am not being harsh enough. It’s not merely that feminists are focusing on low priority issues. They are focusing on issues that aren’t even helping women and are often harmful or based on incorrect/false claims. For instance, many feminists focus on the alleged “underrepresentation” of women in certain fields, like STEM, when this may reflect differences in men and women’s preferences that are magnified under egalitarian conditions. Likewise, many feminists continue to reiterate the myth that the wage gap is driven primarily by discrimination against women, when there is little evidence that this is the case.

Thus, not only do feminists emphasize issues of lesser moral importance, they often focus on non-issues. 

>I have never heard of the site everdayfeminism, but I am relatively confident that they don't speak for all feminists.

I never claimed that they did. Again you misrepresent my position by implication.

>You are selectively picking what feminists you want to acknowledge

I literally provided a link to an organization of feminists doing what I say feminists ought to. You didn’t. You gave a ridiculous example of Barack Obama. I’ve done more to provide evidence against my position than you have. Give me a break.

>and then parade around in triumphant when you find they support your conclusion.

This is hyperbolic and silly. I am not parading.

>There are better approaches than the strawman you constructed.

As I said, I’m not only not strawmanning, I’m not even being as critical of feminism as is warranted.

>For instance, feminists and their organizations have overwhelmingly supported certain politicians.

Okay? So? Which politicians, and why? I probably disagree with their decisions and consider these to be low priority/poor decisions. I don’t agree with, for instance, universal paid parental leave as something that should be state-mandated. Why is expanding the welfare state a feminist cause? I asked this before, you didn’t explain (or did you? Sorry if you did, and if so, point me to it), and I asked again and you still didn’t explain.

>Given that it is unlikely feminists would roundly support a politician if they were not upholding the communities views, it's fair to say that we can take the views of politicians feminists roundly support as a proxy for the views of feminists.

This is a highly obscure, indirect, and weak way to support your Obama example. 

>At the very least, we can say that the views of politicians feminists roundly support are a better better proxy for the views of feminists than a website you found.

Why can we say that?

>Now, you claim that I haven't given you a single instance of a western feminist denouncing how women are treated in Muslim countries. This is an odd claim considering that I have. Again, Barack Obama, a self-identified feminist who was roundly supported by feminists, not only condemned the treatment of women in Muslim countries, but started the campaign against ISIS - even, in part, defending military action on the grounds that ISIS was brutalizing women

I don’t accept this as a legitimate example. Obama is the president of the United States and it’s not possible to know whether his actions were motivated by feminism in particular or not. I find it doubtful they were. Please find an example of a feminist who isn’t a standing president who has political and moral obligations for pursuing a particular course of action that supercede feminist commitments.

>you would like another contemporary example you can look at Hillary Clinton. Clinton famously said, ""women's rights are human rights"" in China, a line that was intended, and taken, as an attack on the sexists policies of the Chinese government and oppressive countries the world over.

This is also not a good example. Can you present an example of an actual feminist activist and not a politician who merely says “I’m a feminist”?

>The evidence suggests that your assertion is incorrect.

Which assertion is incorrect?

>It is simply the case that feminist elect people to office who show great concern for women in oppressive countries. 

I never said otherwise. Did I? You have not refuted my argument. You have not even clearly stated what my argument is. I already asked you to do so, so I will ask again:

What is my argument?

>Your confusion here is that I have some obligation to defend either position

I’m not confused and I’d appreciate if you stop with this sort of language. It’s ridiculous.

You aren’t really obligated to do anything. Neither am I.


> One is that feminists already spend a significant portion of their political energy supporting women in the developing world. This has been demonstrated above.

No. It has not. You showed the president of the US attacked ISIS and that Hillary Clinton once made a comment about women’s rights. This is incredibly feeble evidence. In fact, this is such weak evidence it makes me update in favor of there being even less evidence for the idea that feminists spend much of their efforts on helping women in developing countries. If this is the best you’ve got, I am even less inclined to believe any significant portion of feminists are working on e.g. helping victims of ISIS.


>Another counter-argument is to say that you can care about justice without spending any of your time supporting women in the developing world

What is it a counterargument to?

>This has been true since at least the end of WW2, if not before then. Thus, if you want to defend your argument, you must either 1) bite the bullet and say that no political or social movement in the US should be concerned with our affairs, and instead concern themselves with only their worse off peers in the developing world - this includes the civil rights movement, or 2) provide some insight into why feminism is uniquely responsible to take on this task.

Not exactly. There is diminishing marginal value to investment in a given cause, so it is entirely consistent with my position that we should direct more, but not all, efforts towards people who are worse off in developing countries. This generally holds true of activist/charitable causes:

 http 

Even so, my position is pretty close to (1). I’m a utilitarian. I believe far more efforts should be directed to ending poverty in the developing world and that it is quite literally immoral for people to focus on low priority causes. In other words, I am not merely stating that it is morally worse for feminists to focus on manspreading: I’m claiming that it’s immoral for them to do so because they have an obligation to maximize utility and are failing to meet that obligation.

Regarding (2), I never claimed feminists are uniquely responsible. Everyone is responsible.

>You could save yourself a considerable amount of time by doing more reading comprehension. I didn't say you were incapable of ever changing your mind.

As to the suggestions, they're good ones and I'll certainly investigate them and see if anyone around here is willing to help in those ways. I got the feeling from talking with the local shelters/rescue groups that they were overburdened by their own animals and were generally unwilling to help, but perhaps it was my approach (though, I do remember saying something like, ""Well, okay, you don't have room. I understand. But can I send you a photo and a description and you just put that up with the other animals?"" The response was vitriolic and took about two minutes but can be summed up with: We have our own problems. Goodbye.).

I'm sensing this is the general attitude of folks that have had extended time in a shelter. Which is understandable to some extent, but I've had short stints in shelters and my wife was a vet tech for some years and we never encountered such hostile people where we were, so I can only presume that either animal people in Austin are generally assholes or the shelters are simply over-full and under-funded.

Yes it does. Either the game sucks and was never going to make them a livable wage or they didn't do a good enough job at marketing it or they had completely unrealistic expectations when they went in.

I'm punting for a combination of all 3.

If you're going to invest your time/effort for free with the eventual goal of making money then you should figure out how likely that is to work for you first. To do it properly requires looking at the world as it really is, warts and all. Indie game development has the odds stacked against you. Piracy is real, it's going to happen to your game. If you don't build your plan to reach your goal in spite of these problems I don't have sympathy when it inevitably fails.

214 is the only number that matters. If that's defined as not enough then that's entirely the problem of the developers. It's their job to convince enough people to buy it to make money and there are plenty of people out there being successful in spite of the exact same problems. 

Don't blame the world. Make a better game, market it better, explore alternative revenue sources or get more realistic expectations.

"My first post was arguing that environment plays a big role in turning you into a psychopath. Which is what you are ignoring. An oppressive environment turned the students into psychos. An abusive childhood often leads to criminality and psychopathic behavior. Yes there are CLEAR brain structure differences between ""normal"" and ""psychopaths"" but there are also ENVIRONMENTAL reasons that the psychopathic behavior appears. 

This guy is a neuroscientist of 20 years and he has more knowledge about psychopaths than you can claim to understand. The brain is not a machine that works independent of environment. A feral child is not born feral, he is turned feral by his environment. Human beings have the ability to do good or evil and part of their actions is a consequence of their environment.

>I wasted a chunk of my time arguing with some underage who wasn't actually looking for a discussion, but for a soapbox to claim how better he is than everyone else.

You realize you come off exactly as you accuse him of being? Your choice of words, such as ""princess"", ""kid"", ""Underage"" makes you come off as the one who's looking to vent. Heck, you admit to venting in your final message, which wasn't truly part of the discussion, because you're ""reasonably frustrated"".

A mark of adulthood is the ability to contain your frustrations rather than shoot off in all directions. Those who can't curb their immediate desires are called, well, children.

You could use a refresher on acceptable behaviour. That we are adults, and this is the internet doesn't mean you should be rude, what purpose does it serve, aside from making you feel good about yourself, aside from venting, which as we've covered, is childish behaviour?

">I hope that this clears up some points for you

I will give you a single point for being hilariously condescending, but that does nothing for your deluded position.

You have attempted to excuse centuries of institutionalized subjugation and genocide committed against a particular race/sect of people. This is unacceptable. Men, women, children, the elderly, infants; none were spared by the servants of Christ when they thirsted for blood, which was quite often. The Holocaust was simply the cherry on the cake of the centuries of unmitigated hatred and slaughter.

To attempt to sweep this under the rug is absolutely unforgivable behavior and proves that you are not right in the head.

You have tried to discount the never ending string of crimes, the unbroken chain of evil, committed by the Catholic church as me having ""bad feelings"". You are either an apologist or you haven't the slightest idea of the heinous history of the church. I challenge you to name an atrocity that can be committed by one human against another that has not been performed by the church in an official capacity. Genocide, unbridled and shameless greed, slavery, subjugation of indigenous peoples around the globe, institutionalized child rape, you name it.

>Theology is just as valid of a institutional field of study as any of those

I'm going to break character here - that of the man who clearly has the higher ground in both education and a grip on reality - and mention to you that your statement quoted above is the most retarded thing I have read in a very long time that wasn't in crayon. It's absolutely breathtaking. How can a person that has enough intelligence to formulate a sentence actually insist on such an absurdity?

Theology is the study of fairy tales. It is an effort on par with determining the shoe size of the average leprechaun or the length of the average unicorn horn. There is no respect to be offered a person that spends their life trying desperately to make a round peg fit a square hole simply because they are determined to prove their delusions valid.

"> I feel like if someone insults your body, yes it might hurt, but it proves that they are ultimately superficial people, but to care what they say, means that at some level you'd have to be superficial too.

You seem to be blaming victims of cyber bullying for feeling hurt by others insulting their physical appearance. The idea that one should ""invest time in improving abilities"" to ""become something that's worth a damn"" is reductive and condescending. Everyone is worth a damn, and should be able to feel like they are worth a damn without being bullied, regardless of their ""worthwhile abilities.""

">Sigh, why does everyone have to try and force intersex people into either male or female.

Is this really something that stumps you? I get the point that you're trying to make, but this is not a productive way to dive into it.

The answer to your question is that for tens of thousands of years, humans have largely acknowledged only two genders. Openness to sexuality and gender as subjective human experiences are things that have really only begun taking root relatively recently in human history and most definitely have only become acceptable in modern times.

Make your argument, but please don't make it in a way that simplifies the world around you so much by pretending that tens of thousands of years of human culture and interaction aren't sitting under the foundations of our concrete and our traditions.

Be less condescending about it. To many people, this isn't such an obvious, basic human concept. Those are the people you need to convince, and acting like it should be a ""no shit"" idea is only going to alienate them.

It's frustrating, yes, but tackling adversity with condescendence only serves to further segregate whatever metaphysical gap that blocks the opposition from understanding.

The majority of people are taught that there are men and there are women and there's nothing else. Please keep that in mind and the discussion can become way more productive for all sides involved."

"> He still burns people alive.

not infidels which is what you said before :V

> MMD was meant to be used as a blood sacrifice, that is why she was equally tied up with Drogo's pyre. She didn't just randomly decide to enter the flames in the middle of the burning. Instead, her actions were planned.

Debatable, she truly wanted MMD dead perharps by it she hoped something would happen to her eggs as well. She entering the pyre was pure instinct however

> She still believed that he betrayed her and her brother, yet she gave him the chance to make amends and he succeeded in that role and was sincere.

He didn't hurt her directly however like Jorah and her follower in the series did, as I said again, Dany is not dumb, she is not going to refuse help from one of the most renowed knights of westeros because of grudges, it's kinda like the same situation were Stannis gave a second chance to the stormlords that sided with Renly

> MMD wasn't a close companion that Dany had traveled with for a long time, moreover she betrayed her in a worse way and her death was meant to play a specific role.

Dany killed her for vengeance and Dany felt pity and trusted her like she trusted her followers

It seems to me you should have a problem with how the follower was portrayed in the series and not Dany herself

>She shows a similar amount of companionship with her handmaidens as she does Jorah.

In the series? False, evidenced by one betraying her and stealing her ""children"" 
In the books? Maybe

>The burning of Harrenhall was a battle, thus fact that Aegon's weapon was more effective doesn't make it an execution. Hiroshima couldn't defend itself from the atom bomb, but that doesn't make that an execution.

Hiroshima was an execution as well (unless you're trying to say it was a battle xD), as was Harrenhall. Let me say a prisioner is bound by ropes and I have a gun with me, I shoot him, he dies, it isn't an execution?

That's basically wha Aegon did, the gun being dragon, Harren being basically bound in his castle

> You disprove your own point by mentioning how there were means to fight back against the dragons, just because Harren the Black failed at his attempt doesn't negate that fact.

How did I? Of course there are means thatone can fight the dragons but what makes teh situation an execution is not the dragon itself but the one-sidedness of the situation

You have quite the poor interpretation don't you?

>He might be dead, but his death was relatively quick and easy rather than slow and torturous.

Both will be dead at the end of the day either way

> Hardly funny, we see that Westeros has no problem outlawing flaying thus it isn't like they are cool with everything.

It is for me, you're reading ASOIAF, full of fucked up people that don't play by the rules and you're advocating for a clean death like purists that complain about violence in the show xD

>It is an utter sick and disgusting action, that fact that Stannis allows that shit is a great negative to his character with him acting unjust.

Unjust would be if he killed innocents :V

Kings and other lords have the option to make traitors suffer if they want, hardly a new thing in the story with foucs on teh dark ages and in which violence was so common

If you have a problem wiht that you might be better not reading it at all


> You are absolutely attempting to justify it by pretending it isn't a big deal and saying ""Well, Ramsay is worse"" like that is a defense.

I'm saying that there are worse people out there, am I wrong? Or you mind believes that Stannis is the only fucked up guy in westeros for some random headcanon?

>Much less of a change than just making up scenes. Simply, Stannis has already burnt people alive who merely refused to go along with burning the symbols of their faith.

In the books he let other people practice their fate freely :V
So I guess him burning up infidels is a D&D making up scenes as well huh?


>No, my point is that Stannis' actions are absolutely wrong and both cases for the fact of the method he employs. I also said I hardly see it worse if the reason he uses his method is because he actually believes in it rather than him doing it all for show.

Changing the goalpost again

Honestly so you don't care if it's an innocent or a traitor that it's burned? For you there is no diference? Man you truly are strange


>Traitors in the sense that they oppose Stannis' objectives, not because they have been found guilty in any trial (including his own brother).

Stannis is a king, so he judges accordingly, the people he burned were all traitors to his orders and wronged him by trying to or effectively betraying him as an example ""Mance"", that Florence guy and the two cannibals.


> Because it ridiculous to say one is some horrible change when it is a vastly less of change than just fabricating scenes. Stannis performs his crimes repeatedly in the books and shows zero remorse while Dany doesn't do any of hers.

""zero remorse""

Bruh do you even read Davos' POV? Where Stannis clearly laments the situation with his brother?

Anyway I wonder why you don't consider Stannis burning innocent people as a fabrication scene considering it's a thing he didn't do in the books as well kinda like Dany's killing her follower. Double standarts? 

I don't consider it so like I don't consider Dany's scenes to be fabrications as well. The problem with Stannis scenes is the reason being changed, in Dany's case the reason behind the scenes mostly remains the same

> Only they don't, they are completely made up scenes with no connection to anything happened in the book. Stannis' actions are vastly more compatible.

Refer to my past answer...

Him burning innocents is compatible though? Ok give me one example then 


>False, she had much more reasons for why she executed MMD than she did her handmaiden. 

MMD killed her husband and child, the handmaiden stole her dragons (her children) 

Idk reasons seems pretty much similar to me

>Torture while messed up morally (Stannis does it also), isn't the same as brutally killing some random person. 

Actually in some cases torture can be worse than death

>The Wineseller actually had a connection with some deaths of her Unsullied while that guy had none that the show tells us of. 

She had no confirmations tho just a baseless hint...like the one in the show

it was an impulsive decison y'know...like the one in the show

oh look it's more similar than we thought


>Furthermore, that ordering of sharp questioning came after it being recommended to her by Shavepate before and made in a heated moment. While, the show's actions was cool and calculated move not recommended by anyone and in fact conflicts with her beliefs in episode almost immediately before that one.

Blame the script or Emilia's acting, the essence of the scene is pretty much the same:

torturing/ killing someone with no true indication he did the deed

the show just added dragons because dragons are cool

>Yeah, Stannis' opinion sure has changed in ASOS he burns people to please a religion he doesn't believe in, in the beginning of ADWD he burns people to please a religion he doesn't believe in, and at the end of ADWD he burns people to please he doesn't believe in. What an amazing change of absolutely nothing.

I was talking about the comparision between the shows and the books dude, please learn some basic interpretation

In the show he burns infidels, innocent people in general
In the books ehe doesn't do such thing, half od his army is made up of people with another fate

>In contrast, to Dany's lack change of where she doesn't do any of that stuff thus she can hardly change her opinion on that matter. Though, we do know that she allows two individuals she believed to betray her have the chance to redeem themselves.

She didn't gave Jorah any chance though, she exiled him and told him he would die if he came back

Barristan as I said, it's a case similar to the Stannis + stormlords situation

Dany's main prolem in the show IMO is how she looks decisive in everything she does, which goes against her character in DWD I don't think she was adapted perfectly, I just don't think she was blackened or villified, the fact a big part of the show watchers root for her is enough proof they don't see most of her actions as bad

>Yes, because I am being objective and recognizing some stuff was darkened while other stuff was lightened.

Yet you clearly said before Stannis was blackened in comparision with the books xD

> Both are utterly horrible, and they are more similar to each other than just made up scenes with no connection to the books.

Burning innocents and sacrifices = burning traitors and betrayers ?

Oh wow...this is harsh mate...

>made up scenes with no connection to the books.

Oh you also mean the scne where Stannis burn innocent people in this one too huh?


>It doesn't conflict with anything about book:Stannis, we know that after BW he was desperate and we know they have sex. It is hardly a massive change, instead shows some of Stannis' weaknesses.

You brought this argument again sigh

If you can't prove anything, it's a headcanon, it's bullshit, doesn't matter if it will fit in the book or not, come back if you have actual proof

>Once again your defense seems to be a I deserve to have my opinion yet if others' opinion differs from mine than there is something wrong with them.

">Hardly the first movie where evil things happen at night-time and the afterlife is filled with heavenly light

But thats not what it is, the cinematography for almost the entire final four films is very dark, not matter if its day time or nighttime. The castle in half blood prince is very dark and ominous and foreboding during the entire day and the castle itself is almost a character, the walls close in on the characters in times of stress. 

This was a point many have made to detract from the films that, they were literally dark. Idziak the cinematographer for three colors blue did order of the phoenix, delbonnel did half blood prince and serra did deathly hallows. theres many dark scenes inside and outside during the day

Thats a barcode of all the movies together anon, so its scrunched, there are images for every single film that are more detailed, those are them combined so you can see them. Look up the cinematographers, John Seale did Philosophers stone, he just came out of retirement and shot Mad Max Fury road. Pratt did 2 and 4 and he shot films such as 12 Monkeys and Brazil. 3 just had amazing cinematography by Sesserin, 5 was idziak who is polish and the film has that sort of gritty tone to it, he did three colors blue, black hawk down among many other films, Delbonnel is french did amelie and inside lewis davis and did half blood prince which has earthy tones. Serra did the girl with the pearl earing is Portuguese so the film has a desaturated look. So no I dont think this was ever done before in this manner with the tone progression the series devolves into a witchcraft horror tale after being a happy magical land.

Also I dont appreciate your condescending attitude, at all. Lord of the rings can be artistic and loved by the masses but harry potter cant? There's plenty involved with the filmmaking and the cinematography that many don't notice, the shots often speak for themselves in Cuarons and Yates entries. "

Well no, that still doesn't follow (like I said before), but I'd happily say you do see a moral improvement in terms of crime between the atheist/theist divide (and sure, this may not all be causal). Check the infographic I sent you, showing a high correlation between state religiosity and crime rate.

Nope. Just speaking my own personal opinion. But yes, it does seem that way. 60% of scientists are atheists, and 90% of the NES (National Academy of Science) are atheists.

I'm not into that how condescending thing you've got going on.


>Just be you and let others be them.

Fine. I agree. Then you have to make sure that there's no legislation introduced to allow creationism/intelligent design in school, that there's no christian billboards, no religious tv programs, no religious radio, no walking door-to-door theists, no theists standing on corners on soapboxes with bullhorns,....

"> A person cannot assume the context of the person who originally stated it.

The context of where it is stated is usually more important for the receiver, than the context of which the person has internalized. If there is confusion, usually the one making the statement clarifies this, according to his intention. This you have done, by being condescending (""It takes what half a second""). So, from my point of view, your intention was to provoke, which you managed. If you had no intentions (a humorous statement is still an intention to make someone laugh), then you would not have typed anything in the first place. ""FirstWorldProblems"" is in this thread and subreddit a loaded statement. You would have not typed this as a comment to an issue in a bug-database.

#My argument is about empiricism

Don't condescend to me about helping. You're the one that can't see outside of your preconceived little box. You can't even acknowledge my argument its so alien to you.

> And now, I understand your true motivation: Statism! You want to create an atheist ""utopia"" on the grounds that religion leads to genocide, wars and oppression. You really need to read more! People are quite capable of killing others without the need for religious excuses. 

Doesn't mean religion doesn't directly instigate it, and maintain racial boundaries on the basis of magical beliefs. Your beliefs are a cult. They conflict with reason based on evidence and threaten lives. These texts blatantly endorse slavery, the oppression of women and abuse towards gays. Its theists that purport delusions of utopia and heaven and then deliver the opposite. I simply want to live in a world without corruption. All you've done is corrupt the truth. Don't pretend your cult is any different.

> You do realize that communist atheist regimes were responsible for the deaths of over 100 Million people in the twentieth century, correct?

Communist atheist regimes do not value democracy and neither does theism. Communism is its own religion, and more comparable to your cult than a secular democracy.

Because that what Christianity is too. 

> It is actually ""okay"", but there is no real reason to believe things that are made up. 

No it isn't. Misinformation harms, and purporting falsities that fail to pass trial and error condemns others that might believe you to the same mistakes. If you were cognizant, you should have learned already by failing to prove these perverse conclusions. 

> Yes, but no one knew it existed. 

It still shaped the Earth and caused the sun to form. It doesn't matter if anyone knew about it, gravity still exists prior to interpretation. Subjective phenomenology is causally preceded by objectively real phenomenon. Matter before mind. Not the other way around. Your reasoning is backwards and immoral.

> In the same way, just because you haven't seen god or seen the evidence for god, doesn't mean he doesn't exist.

Absolutely not. Gravity can be measured and then and only then can be conclude that it exists. You have not accomplished that yet. Therefore you can not know.

> Again, you're not the ""Judge"". Each person gets to evaluate the evidence on their own (Bible, intelligent design, etc.)

Evidence is the judge. Trial and error. Cause and effect. Evidence speaks for itself. Of which you have none for god. You give yourself away by failing to support your claim.

> No, just lazy. Already feel like I'm wasting too much time with you. You go look it up yourself if you want to.

Not lazy. Reason based on evidence. And I'm most certainly wasting my time on you. You can't reason. But its easy to refute you as long as I tell the truth.

> Says the guy/gal who wants to create and enforce their atheist utopia!

Not enforce. Just hold false claims to a standard of evidence. And banning religious extremists from voting. If you can't pass a vote license and prove that you can reason based on evidence, then you shouldn't be able to affect the people around you. Just like driving a car. But again you wouldn't know that unless you asked. This is that mistake you keep making by not holding claims, mine and yours, to a standard of evidence. Some beliefs are correct in practice. That doesn't make them morally superior. That makes them right.

I understand that events precede my interpretation of them and reference them in my argument and counter argument as a common point of reference. You don't. 

> I look forward to shredding your arguments for belief in evolution and global warming

You think global warming is fake? Species are dying out faster than the dinosaurs died out. Just pick up an almanac and look up the peak temperatures every year. The proof is there for those who seek it. Without evidence, your entire argument in an argument for ignorance. You just want to believe whats been presented to you and that it. In fact, its probably just my perceived tone that keeps you going, isn't it? What an animal. People like you pose a real problem. That's why religion in failing, in particularly due to the rise of the information age when people can't be dumbed down and silenced anymore, and why more people are speaking out against religion now more that ever. Your regime is ending and people are waking up the the cancer that is magical belief. You make up your own rules and can't be reasoned with, and create conflict between other groups and between yourselves. Theism isn't an alternative view.

"> classical music gets a lot more technical than metal 
 
Are you saying that to be condescending or do you know nothing about metal? There are metal musicians who literally play lines from classical pieces in their songs. Necrophagist does this. The end solo is a Prokofiev piece (and, I might add, is notably less technical than the rest of the song). Alexi Laiho released a series of instructional videos on playing Vivaldi's Four Seasons metal style. Metal can be as technical or simplistic as you want to make it, just like classical music. 
 
> it's not really the technicality that's the major draw, it's the timbre; 
 
Again with the condescension. Then why don't (the vast majority of) Necrophagist fans also listen to Korn? Same timbre. And why don't classical fans all flock to Apocalyptica? It's played on acoustic cellos. 
 
Based on your argument the same could be said about classical/jazz. Many people listen to classical/jazz because it's ""pretty"" and ""soothing"" and don't know shit about music theory. Should I say that therefore the major draw must be the ""timbre""? If you want to lump in non-technical metal fans, then you have to lump in non-technical classical fans too. 
 
I like metal for its ""timbre"" as much as I like it for its technicality. I also listen to both classical/jazz for the exact same reasons. I like both their timbre and technicality. Why do you insist that classical/jazz is the bastion of technicality and that their fans are somehow more appreciative of technical prowess? Certain forms of classical fetishize technicality just like certain forms of metal and certain forms of jazz. And for every Slayer there are Pachelbel's Canons and Kenny G's. 
 
Perhaps the technical fans of metal don't all indulge in classical because most classical music was written hundreds of years ago and does not reflect current cultural themes and fans of classical music like to cultivate a condescending attitude towards outsiders by playing their music in giant concert halls and charging $200 per ticket and wearing tuxedos to the show. Perhaps classical music fans don't like to hang around in bars full of pot smoke and 25-year olds.

It's seriously like you've written this part to yourself. Funny how people who accuse others of projection tend to be the ones who accuse others of it in the first place. Oh wait ... that makes total sense. 

Really. All I did was point to a statement where someone seemed to have said Palestine was a place, and then said it was not a place. You responded that it ""used to"" be a name for a place, and you spouted something that Herodotus and I have thus far proven to be inaccurate. Not once have you acknowledged the fact that your first statement was just plain wrong, and now you keep trying to explain it away.

Your original statement was wrong, I pointed out that it was wrong, and pointed out how similar statements were made by Zionists and Israel's propaganda department, at which point you just became ridiculously butt-hurt. 

Throughout it all you have yet to realize that YOU are the one presenting partisan (with an 's') rhetoric and idiosyncratic/unusual ideas (like the idea that the Romans were the first to call the place Palestine). The twisted logic that permeates your repetitive arguments (""haven't often considered themselves Palestinean"") against what is basically a straw man.

I never said they were always Palestineans.

I never said the place has always been Palestine. 

And I never even said that everyone in the area today identifies themselves as Palestinean.

So all the little mental flourishes are for ... what? Who are you really arguing against? You claimed that the name didn't exist before the Romans, and that it ""used to"" apply to the area now known as Israel. You didn't ""says that they weren't"" anything about the people of Palestine, you were responding about a place name. And your response came off as the same kind of smug bullshit you'd hear from Hasbara or any number of pro-Israeli groups, so I pointed that out. I don't recall mentioning a ""zionist plot."" So that's really not lunatic, it's stating the obvious. Sorry again that you seem to be so sensitive :( Otherwise all we've established is that you have an extremely subjective definition of what a place's name can be, and that you know a bunch of different words and claim a bunch of different things.

>If you are still living in moms basement but have a sack every day then you need to be judged harshly for that.

Judgement isn't a necessity to change this person's habits, and in facts, hurts it. When one judges, it's making a conclusion about the whole person, which is usually what racists do. Would I expect a racist to have a well-informed conclusion on people outside his/her race? No. Do I expect him to think he is well-informed? Yes. It is only a flaw in thinking which never was straightened out. Is his views distasteful? Yes, but rationally poking holes in his views will change them rather than looking down at him condescendingly, which only makes the person more frustrated and makes them cling to their prejudices even more. The same sort of generalizations one might make when judging a racist is a less form of the generalization a racist might make of someone outside their race.

>If you are a racist you don't have the luxury of saying your parents raised you like that. You are responsible for yourself and you deserve to be judged for the choices you make.

Being brainwashed all your life doesn't give a person a luxury of an excuse for saying ""I was brainwashed all my life"" because more than likely the person who is brainwashed a) doesn't know it, and b) confidently thinks his worldview is right due to lack of experience. Only rationally putting people on the spot slowly hinges a person's perspective, judging them and demeaning them does not. This goes with any personal imperfection an individual might have.

Modern hardware is more than capable of running Cortana locally. In fact, bandwidth is still more precious than CPU for most people (and occasionally unavailable/unreliable).

">Hey if you want to blindly ignore the intent of the author's own words, by all means go for it. 

That is exactly what you are doing here you condescending dickweed. You are taking one WoG where Saitama beats characters from Worm and are vastly misinterpreting it to your own advantage to say that he beats all characters. Based off of feats Saitama likely couldn't even beat an awakened Eidolon, fight me.

>All I'm sayin' is, if Wibbles were hypothetically quoted in a WoG saying ""Batman would have a contingency plan for handling Contessa; the point of his character is that he can leverage detective work, preparation, and clever use of resources to be ready to take on anyone."" then I would logically take that to mean that yes, Batman could also handle Eidolon/GU/Echidna as well.

All I'm sayin' is, this is such a fucking stupid hypothetical that I feel dumber after reading it. For one you could just as easily say the point of Contessa's character is to win. For two, even if WB said that he'd still have to show that Batman had feats that let him beat her. And because he can beat Contessa he can now beat characters who can delete him with a thought? You're going to need to stretch prep really fucking far for that to happen.

This is what a real Batman vs Contessa thread looks like. If you see nobody is bringing up ""point of the character"", they are all using feats and logic. Something you don't seem familiar with.

What I'm saying is that just because Saitama can beat Endbringers doesn't mean he beats everybody. If you are too caught up in bullshit and fanyboyism to not see that, then I don't need to talk to you."

Where does it say 'to make a living'? No where, because that is not what 'commercially viable' is. Commercially viable is something which can make a profit. Nothing about starting a business, maybe if people looked at XBLIG as a way to make games in a larger indie dev setting then yes, it wouldn't be commercially viable, but going back to one of my earlier posts:

>Its applications might be limited to larger indie devs but I wouldn't say it's not 'real' enough.

I had made this distinction which you refused to acknowledge, because despite everything you say you don't judge small indie game devs as being 'real'.
I don't want to keep repeating myself here but I hope you at least now understand you're wrong in your implication of what 'commercially viable' is, you can't arm wrestle the term to mean what you want.

>I'm not saying nobody can ever make money but seriously there isn't anyone in there right mind that could invest in XBLIG and expect a real return.

Except lots of people, by your own definition, have made an investment in XBLIG and made a 'real return'.

Or are we expanding and creating new definitions for the term 'real' again?

>Anyway we are arguing in circles. We are coming at this from different places and I'll let posterity judge who is correct here.

I'll let the dictionary judge who is correct, facts are facts and yours are out of whack, it doesn't matter what other people say really ;)


I don't like that you judge what is 'real' or not, whether you like it or not that is being condescending towards people for using tools to make money, you're saying what they're doing is wrong and therefore not 'real'. you can act like you're saying the platform is crappy but you're also saying anyone who built a game and sold it for money on it was a fool, why? Because you said so, because it doesn't build a larger indie game dev, because that is obviously the goal of every indie game dev according to you."
">Well no, we know it is true, and its not a matter of opinion
>You're not listening to common sense here.

Ok. I'll take a moment to respond. Is it possible that you have convinced yourself of something and are unwilling to see past your own intellectual prowess? Maybe it's hard for me to understand your point because it's not intellectually solid and/or it's worded in a way that isn't convincing.

> The people in Galatia were much closer to the Apostles than you are. They would have a much better picture of what Paul taught than you, because they, you know, actually knew him and interacted with him.

Paul established the church there. Paul, as you indicated, would have been physically present to interact with them and teach them. Yet the church was in grave error. This entire epistle isn't a pat on the back because they were doing so well. They were being led astray by judaizing false teachers. 

Their place on the historical time line and their personal interaction had no benefit here. Without Paul's letter, had they continued on that same path, they would have ultimately been cast off because they were replacing Christ by a system of works.

> I mean, who has a better, more accurate view of the Eiffel tower: people in Paris, or people in Chicago? Who has a better understanding of the battle of Zama: people who experienced it, or people today? Who has a better understanding of what the apostles taught: those who were taught by the Apostles, or people 2000 years later? 

You are comparing two unlike things. One is tangible. The tower we can see. We can touch. We can measure. In your illustration here the root cause for the problems with the view is physical distance. You are comparing a physical object with non physical teaching/comprehension.

One of these can be commented on by physical observation. The other needs the intellect. We know the Galatians strayed from their path. According to your logic they shouldn't have. After all Paul would have been expositing Christ and grace to such a degree there wouldn't have been any other possible conclusion. It's what Paul did by the way. As evidenced by every single letter he wrote.

Their inability to understand, stay the course or otherwise mature properly is effected by a number of different variables. One of those is spiritual growth, which yes is given by God. That's not something that we affect ourselves. Hence the wide variances between people. 

I am not worse off than these Galatians because I have access to the entirely of the cannon of scripture. I can work through these letters and make conclusions. I can see that Paul exposits certain things, I can see the number of instances and I can see the emphasis.

Your conclusion is firmly planted in assumption. You assume that since Galatian 'A' and Paul occupy the same space on a physical plane that surely they had a fuller more robust understanding of Paul's teaching. While they had access to more verbal spoken words you assume that 'A' is better off, has a fuller understanding and could likewise communicate said truths better than someone alive today. Yet the letter to the Galatians show that they didn't understand the most pivotal point to Paul's teaching. They were substituting Christ by transitioning back into a system of works. 

This tells you that they didn't understand the cross, they didn't understand who Christ was, They didn't understand their own sinful state or how their own works were viewed by God. We can easily come to these conclusions merely by reading Hebrews, Romans and The Galatians only. Yet our knowledge is expanded even more by looking into the Old Testament usage of the New Testament writers. It helps that I have access to my own written English text, Hebrew text, Greek Text and around 40 other translations. I can sit with a static text and research. Something that these Christians couldn't do because it's not like they had access to the full NT cannon, much less multiple copies of letter that may or may not have been written. While they had access to Paul to a certain degree over a brief time I have been able to sit and study Paul seriously for over a decade.

Again you assume just because they were there they could understand and fully comprehend which we know they didn't. If what you said was true about this church Paul either wouldn't have written this letter at all, or this letter would be one praising them for a number of different reasons as opposed to correcting their dangerous misunderstanding of what He said.

>Well, you can tell me you understand what the Apostles taught better than their students because you have direct guidance of the Holy Spirit, and I'll say you're just feeling Teh Feelz and self-suggestion.

This is condescendingly amusing. Have you never studied what the Holy Spirit does in terms of operation. I am not stating that there is divine revelation or God is speaking to me in a mystical fashion. This isn't a charismatic viewpoint. I am chiefly stating that the mere reason I, or anyone, would have understanding is because the Spirit allows it or enables it (John 14:26; 1Co 2:13) and that it is given in different measures to different people according to God's will (Rom 12:3).

You can't get around the fact that God uses multiple means to convey his truth. He can use the written word and He can use a person but he is using them according to His will and His measure. One method isn't superior to another method simply because one is a living person that you can interact with and another is a book of text. God uses both. You don't have to believe it but the entirety of Christian history would attest to that. Are you hesitant to understand that because of your Catholic beliefs or is it that you are obstinate to the point where you are beyond rebuke or correction?

At the end of the day applicable knowledge and wisdom are solidified by two avenues. The first being the individual personal intellectual comprehension and the second is what is given to that person by God

>Jas 1:5  If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.

But surely I am misguided by ""Teh Feelz"". My suggestion to you would to utilize more tact in your personal interactions and have the humility to see that you don't have all the answers. Because even if you were right about anything it's impossible to see by the fog of arrogance you project.

I'll let you have the last word."
">Women who have respect for themselves are attractive to me.

People have been using contraceptives in one form or another since Roman times.

>Are you conflating women with things? Now that's some serious cognitively dissonant self-hating misogyny right there. I shared everything I was allowed to share actually.

Considering that impeachment is a legitimate function of government, and that calls for it had been made before under that constitution, I would actually say I'm only practicing what I preach.


>There’s nothing wrong with getting really into the game, but some people take the game too personally. The only thing that offends me here is the naked hypocrisy and your attempt to manipulate what I'm saying.


Ah yes, because quoting exactly what you said is manipulating what you're saying.



>How quickly we forget the ‘Impeach Peppermint’ campaign, or Tambien’s griefing the east district with fences. Hummel and I were disappointed, but not very surprised when that happened. For us it confirmed a number of suspicions. Counterproductive behavior like that doesn’t indicate that you value the people in the community as much as you value the symbolism behind the role-playing you’d like to engage in.


Let's not forget that said ""campaign"" consisted, in large part, of placing random signs around town with ""Impeach PeppermintPig!"" written on them. It was never in serious danger of unseating you, and even if it was you removed the signs right after I placed them, so I really don't see why you should feel victimized. As for the fences, I honestly don't remember that, but my reaction to it is that you're really reaching when you call someone a griefer for placing fences. If they were reinforced and/or extremely excessive, now, that's another story. As I said, however, I can't remember, but I'd err on the side of saying that they weren't. Why? Because, if I remember correctly, you were also trying to call me placing those signs, one per city block if not less, griefing. 


In the end though this entire string of argument is irrelevant. Dredging up examples of me messing up in the past has no bearing on this argument now, mostly because you have zero idea of what I'm doing now beyond posting some referendums and bills to the subreddit.


I'd also love to hear what ""suspicions"" it confirmed.

>There was a communal effort to harvest all that wheat. Were you there for that?


It seemed rather accusatory at the time, though if I've misunderstood your meaning I apologize.


As for your pan comment, all I can say is that I think that he has more of a problem with you acting so condescending and confrontational than with you sharing your opinions.


>Bonding and communal effort is not antithetical to anarcho capitalism, and if that’s what you believe then there’s perhaps not much use trying to convince you otherwise. It should be clear that not everyone involved in city cleanup or harvesting is or was an ancap, but I can forgive your ignorance for believing that nationalism is the glue that holds people together as a nation as you seem to believe that the important part is the nationhood and not the community. It’s a little too circular in reasoning and it doesn’t justify what you’re trying to argue.


Have I ever said that community building is antithetical to AnCaps? No. Instead, what I'm saying is that governments give people a framework to use for community building and as a part of community building. Leaving people in vacuum to create their own community framework can work, yes, but more often than not it will fail simply because many people are daunted and shut down when faced with huge numbers of possibilities. For many, having set paths to choose from helps them get started in a system and become an active, productive member of the city. I've talked firsthand with many of the new friends coming in, and quite a few of them have said that having the government structure/framework is what helped them get into the city and stay involved. 


>Civcraft can be a sociopolitical simulator, and there are ways to build Aurora strong, and that first comes down to appreciating the people who would even want to be residents of the city or region since they contribute to the health of the economy. You can enjoy the traditions you’ve chosen to adopt, but if you want to pretend nothing happens without a government and spend more time with political busywork rather than building and trading then I guess that’s what you’ll do.


Again, political role playing contributes to the community in a way that just building public farms and factories can't. Yes, building these utilities is important, but politics and elections and such provide more intangible benefits. They're far from busywork. If you refuse to see that, though, there's not much I can do about it.

It is an endless and pointless debate on semantics, imbued with an overly condescending tone which prevents any respect for your views, even if they were legitimate, and when you aren't doing that you are intentionally misinterpreting what has been said in order to prove your semantic points. Your accusations are baseless and poorly informed, and your desire to mislead must be brought to an end."

And you can put the WHOLE of what you just typed out to me under that category.

As for being anti-intellectual, I'm far from it. I find it bizarre that you are putting that title on me when it's you who's refusing to accept a wider view that not everyone is like you. No where did I say all college students are like me. However, the majority of the people I hung out with, including two students with the highest GPAs in the school, did not book appointments with their friends or SOs. Sure organization and time management is good - I did plenty of that when the semester got hecktic. But at no point in time did I put down on my calender: ""To do - socialize with Tom and Andrew (1hr)"". Maybe that's how you handled your friendships, but you're in the minority there.

>Maybe one day when you grow up you will be more aware of how we all were emotionally immature at college age and will upvote one of my posts. Hopefully, but the only reason you're involving right now is because you think I'm a shit lord so I doubt you'll change your bigoted ways. Go study for class, or does that require too much uncool scheduling and prioritizing?

I'd just like you to read this over again and tell me whether you think this is a mature response to someone's criticism of your idea. I've graduated from college - but this honestly reads like a high schooler wrote it. You were at least making good arguments earlier - when you were disagreed with you just got massively rude and sulky. Try to make some more good points, and tone down on the insults.

"> regular pug groups beat bosses

My experiences say otherwise. Your examples of ""6 man this"" or ""8 man that"" are irrelevant because it involves people who have enough knowledge, time and build diversity to compensate and who are accustomed to work together... Something you can't expect from a pug. You couldn't ""6 man"" Gors with a pug.

Pugs mean: random people.

It means basically: trusting strangers, their skills and gear. It's nice if you had tons of good experience with them, it happens that I didn't have that luck and for most of my Gors attempts, even if I had a full zerker ascended gear and didn't get downed once and went full damage, we failed. Because it's not all about me, so your call about incompetence or whatever is pointless.

If the DPS checks weren't an issue, I wouldn't have failed with pugs countless of time. So yes, it is tight in a way.

So if ""everyone"" has to ""pay attention"" like you said, why do you claim such shitty things:

One minute you blame one player for being lazy, then the next you admit that everyone needs to be good and pay attention... That's a contradiction by itself. 

And it's just unrealistic to expect everybody to be flawless and competent, especially in a casual MMO.

> Trust me, I have 170 insights and every single achievement in raids. 

Oh almighty God of knowledge, thank you for your wise advices.

See, it's really a shame because you do have knowledge and it could be useful, but you come off as a condescending asshole and it makes the reading of your post a challenge itself. It's unbearable. If you're unable to give advice without being a douchebag, don't post at all... You've been dowvoted for a reason (and one of your post was removed because of some racist comment). An invisible/agressive advice post is pointless, even if it holds some truth somewhere deep within its line.

"> 2D feature films are great, in a nostalgic, hand-crafted sort of way

This is pretty simplistic and condescending. The fluidity of movement and caricature possible in 2D animation exceeds that of 3D. Compare the realism of the deer running in Bambi to the lumbering gait of most 3D characters, who more often resemble vinyl toys than even cartoony humans. 

And the idea that archaic media irrevocably fall to the wayside with each new technological progression is patently false. Look no further than the 2011 Best Picture, The Artist, a silent film shot in grainy black and white. 

In almost any artistic format, the relics of the past are readily apparent. I would be surprised if there weren't successful architects conspicuously incorporating Art Deco references in their work. True, sometimes it takes the impending abandonment of a style or medium in order to resurrect it for nostalgic or other reasons, but the point remains that little completely vanishes.

Cheaper to you or cheaper to everyone?"", you gave me (and have given me) no reason to believe that you were aware of the referenced data, or are willing to think and talk about it honestly.

>Health care is expensive here but it’s not nearly as simple as “non universal health care is bad and expensive”. 

No shit Sherlock. However healthcare in the US costs people a relatively high amount in taxes as it is, a comparatively very high amount in private spending, and is not achieving the outcomes for people that the healthcare systems of other countries are. Maybe, just fucking maybe, the rest of the developed world is on to something?

>nurses from the NHS that are amazed it still functions and that more people don’t die from the dangerous patient ratios

At no point did I imply that all or any other healthcare systems are without flaws. Again, fuck yourself. The only thing that concerns me here is the notion that the USA is simply so star-spangled awesome and unique that a form of universal healthcare would increase costs, lower quality of care, or otherwise fail due to simplistic assumptions or dishonest ommissions on the part of people like you (eg: insinuating that healthcare expenses for the individual are more similar when factoring in taxation).

Yes, they meant the same thing. Do you actually know the Objectivist view on concepts and definitions? I'll bet you didn't bother to read those links I sent you, because you are intellectually lazy. (Using ""collectivism"" the way you did, in the face of accepted definitions, is evidence of that.) 

Definitions and concepts have to mean the same thing when people discuss them, otherwise you aren't talking about the same thing. If people didn't agree on language and concepts, then how would we communicate? Does ""communicate"" mean something different to you than it does to everyone else on this planet?

Is an ""inch"" different to you than it is to me? Mmmmmmmmmmm nope.

> It may be not the strictest of academic definitions, and that is the whole point. Who is the collectivist in this argument?

Acceptance of definitions has nothing to do with collectivism. And you would know that, if you knew the definitions of the words you use. When did I call you a collectivist, exactly?

To me, it sounds like you don't want to be ""locked in"" to the meaning of a word you use... but a concept has to have an identity. You can't violate the law of identity. See what you're doing?

>and mega gnar only has slow, telegraphed attacks. In a 2v2, the side with Gnar loses

There is no world where if Mega Gnar lands ult, the side with Gnar loses. Don't say that ult isn't landing, because that's being unfair to Gnar's side. All Gnar has to do is move along the walls of top lane, and then the enemy 2v2 will be forced to eat the ult or have to disengage from the threat of it.

>A semi-random pattern, yes. That being close 2, far 2, close 2. Only issue is, thats still pretty unreliable. Because whether its vertical close or horizontal close and vertical and horizontal far matters a lot. Vertical far is fairly easy to proc. Horizontal far extremely difficult. Horizontal close is very easy to proc. Vertical close can be trickier. And the enemy can also abuse that by simply moving out of sight while he has close and force it into far.

And Fiora can do that too. And Fiora has Q/MS boosts to be able to move around and proc far vitals. Not to mention she doesn't even have to trade when the vital isn't favorable. You're exaggerating the extent of Fiora's unreliability and the extent to which it inhibits her. 

> he has to Hop immideatly, trying to kite is pointless as Fiora is on him, has slowed him for more than he slowed her for, has also gained bonus movement speed, has another dash up shortly (especially if her Q is higher than level 1) and does far more damage.

No. Gnar slows for 35% for 2 seconds, Fiora slows for 30% for 1 second. Yes, I used maxed Q value for Gnar, because you used maxed value for Fiora's Q cooldown. Not to mention Gnar also has an MS boost because his kit is just that bloated. 

>As I expected, pure numerical value, which of course means that china with its unusual meta game skewed the statistic by virtue of being much bigger.

You can't pick and choose which regions to discount because of their metagames. If that's the case, I can discount Irelia, because she isn't a thing in Korea and Korea is the best region so nothing else matters right? 

Count all of the regions or none of them. Don't use the ones that benefit your argument. 

>See, the trick about a generalist, as I mentioned, is that they can do everything at once. No downtime.

Again, that's a definition you've assigned, not an objective definition. Generalists are flexible, Gnar is a flexible champion because he can bully and then transition into teamfights as a tank. Having both of those attributes on one champion makes champions that can only fill one of those less desirable. That's just logic.

>Gnar is more of a ""well, the better picks are already gone, guess Ill settle with seconds"" pick

Gnar is pick/ban. How is Gnar not the top pick here along with Shen? And since Gnar beats Shen, how does that not put Gnar on top? Well Gangplank exists, I guess. 

> Teemo and Renekton arent not being picked because of Gnar. They arent being picked because they suck.

There isn't a reason to pick bullies that aren't Gnar because Gnar exists. Renekton seriously isn't even that bad. He was seeing play earlier in the Summer split in Korea. Just no reason to pick him because he scales into nothing when Gnar exists and scales into something. The point being scaling bullies is a bad design. 

>Anything that even remotely ""proves"" that Gnar is the one blocking out picks instead of the reality that its the likes of Shen, Irelia and other top picks?

You aren't understanding what 'blocking out' picks means. Irelia and Shen aren't stopping other champions from being picked by the virtue that Gnar does. They occupy their own niches. Gnar occupies two niches and does it better than some of the champions that only have one of them. Irelia isn't even a thing globally, so I don't know why she's in this discussion.

>Meaning that 2 regions completely ignored Gnar, while 2 picked him a lot. And not just that, it was the same people who tended to pick him. So yes, he was a pocket pick. A popular pocket pick, but a pocket pick nonetheless.

For a pocket pick to be picked so often they actually have to be worth something. There can't have been so few options that Gnar was the first resort so often. His kit just does so much he's an overly desirable champion to have. 

>He isnt. Because he doesnt do everything. He has the potential to do a lot, but the ability to only do part of it.

No, he has the ability to do a lot. That it exists in his kit means he has the ability to do it. It's not a hypothetical that Gnar has these things in his kit. It is hard-coded into the game. 

>But yknow, Im curious. Do you even have a single shred of evidence to back your claim up? 

Top lane picks since Gnar became meta in 2015. Gnar has consistency been one of the most picked, and even your data would show that. He may not be #1, but that was never my argument. You don't have to be #1 to make other picks redundant.

That part is entirely unneccessary. You do not need to put the people down you talk about when you ""criticise"" consumer behaviour.

It's condescending bullshit and the only reason it exists (via ""fragile masculinity"") is to mock people, not to affect change.

You don't need to tell anyone that they ""can do this as well because it's not just for X"", because people aren't a hivemind who only do what their stupid (fe)male brain tells them to.

It's like telling women: ""Oh don't worry, you can play video games too. No need to be so scared of the violence.""

> He was blunt. Nothing really wrong with that, you are talking to video game guys, after all.

Don't lump us all into that category. Being forward and being creepy are separated by degrees of tact and understanding social cues.

> Don't you pride yourself on your bold moments, when you said ""screw it"", gathered your guts, and took that leap?

It takes absolutely zero guts to anonymously solicit a strangers information and then proposition them. Again, there's a difference between being bold and being creepy.

> How would you define creepy, I wonder?

Creepy comes in all flavors, but in this particular instance, creepy is defined as instigating a conversation by soliciting information that, given the nature of escapism and anonymity of the gaming medium, is wholly inappropriate. Creepy is attempting to discern their location after being rebuffed. Creepy is carrying his line of questioning further after absolutely no interest was reciprocated.

Abso-fucking-lutely. He pressed on with his bullshit behavior and went from misguided to creepy fuck.

Nothing. But there are discernibly wrong ways of going about such an end. This is a prime example.

> You know Tinder exists, right? And you're aware there are girls on there?

Tinder isn't WoW. Tinder is where people solicit themselves for a chance to find a companion, be it for sex or long term romance. WoW is where people go to escape reality for an hour or two at a time, in a fully immersive and voluntarily anonymous environment. Not even close to the same thing.

> We all want to have sex, and I can't think of anything wrong with that urge.

The second one person's ""urges"" supersede another person's comfort, is where the line is drawn.

> Also, I keep chuckling at the prospect of getting you into bed ""4 words into a conversation"". ha ha , no, I imagine it takes a lady out there quite a few more than 4 reassuring words to get you to that point. I imagine quite a lot of reassurance must indeed be thrown in your direction before you might deign.

This just sounds like you trying to be condescending to a person who used a splash of hyperbole to express their disgust with someone who made very unwanted advances. No shit it'll take any sane person more than 4 words to climb in bed with someone. If you meet someone who you can bed with the sentence, ""Hey you, let's fuck."", chances are they're not someone you should be fucking."

"> i didnt think id have to explain that

The point was that in reply to someone suggesting our aggressive habit of intervening in managing things is an assumption we tend to make until we learn otherwise and that as it turns out is often against our own interests as people who benefit from basically controlling the whole planet.

Your reply seemed to simply ignore this proposition by asserting some boilerplate notion that we're here and have the right to exploit nature. In other words, you don't need to spoon feed, you need to realize you didn't address the point made in your reply.

The point is that to control the planet isn't necessarily to intervene constantly in its natural processes even if we are directly seeking to benefit from them.

>and as for calling it an arrogant self centred view

The arrogance comes from the tendency to intervene in environments because we think we know best. That's for instance clear in the fire fighting example. Your reply was short, and in it you offered none of the things you mention here.

You can be condescending all you like but you didn't give any reason for me to infer anything you said in your follow up in that original. Your original reads like this--

in reply to this --

>At a philosophical level the question is: do humans have to aggressively control the entire planet?

So I'm sorry but you need to reevaluate what you intend to impart in your words as your casual boilerplate human superiority statements offered nothing nuanced and only a reassertion of our primacy.

That isn't going to happen all at once and you know it.

>That's a nice, cherrypicked example. So how about the average Texan, and the couple hundred million people India has to spare?

Of course it's a cherrypicked example, doesn't make it any less relevant, and it doesn't mean you can't respond to it. So respond to it. Simple fact is that the lines are blurred, and borders are arbitrary lines on a map to keep people that other certain people don't like out. ""Nations are just societies for hating foreigners"" - Olaf Stapledon. If a person from Oregon has less in common with a man from Texas, should we make a border between them? If a Texan has more in common with a Mexican should we remove that border? It is all arbitrary.

>Bzzzt, wrong. They're still there. That you're allowed to cross them at-will doesn't change that.

Conceptually it's the same thing, and it's what I'm after. You hardly caught me out on anything here. A german has a surprising amount in common with an Austrian, Austrian with Hungarian, Hungarian with Romanian, Romanian with Bulgarian, Bulgarian with Greek, Greek with Turkish, Turkish with Syrian, oh hey, we've just drawn a line to Syria with a few similar countries.

>Oh, boy. First, like I said, that's because the EU has economic requirements, you don't get in until you have reached a certain level of ""not that poor"". 

Stop with the precursor belittling words. It's there just to sound condescending, and doesn't help your argument at all.

So your argument here is, again ""arbitrary lines in the sand"". What is considered ""not that poor"". Turkey has a higher GDP per capita than Romania, and yet Romania is in the EU, and Turkey is not. ARBITRARY.

>Second, yes, it absolutely did.

It really didn't. I come from the UK, I constantly hear complaints about Polish people from racists. I barely ever see a Polish person. I've seen maybe 3 in my life. They constitute around 1% of our country. Granted, bad example since we aren't in the Schengen area, but for comparison, 2.3% of Germany is Polish, you'd probably see very few of them there too, despite the fact that Germany is MASSIVELY successful economically, and Poland is much less so, and they are LITERALLY right next door to each other. 2 PERCENT.

>Well, mabye instead of inviting social disorder on a massive, global scale, along with the breakdown of social security, we should just fucking do that.

What disorder? You always foresee some doomsday scenario that will never happen, rather than just accepting that actually, very little will change. Just as it did in Europe, just as it continues to do so in Europe. We have more than the capabilities to deal with things like this. It will not be a case of half of the population being replaced by Muslims or Mexicans or whichever ethnicity you hate the most. You know back in 1968 we had this little speech saying that in 10 years Britain would be overrun with blacks, holding the whip over whites, controlling politics, along with mass poverty. Guess what? 50 years later, the country WAS NOT overruns with blacks! CRAZY RIGHT?

>He also faces higher prices than 80% of the world, let's not forget that

But he would still have a better quality of life than 80% of the world, let's not forget that. Guess it's easier to forget when you care more about white people though.

>Non-ideally, the rich will take that money back via higher prices

The rich aren't an entity moving as one. We've had top tax brackets at 90% historically, before the 80s, and if anything prices were lower than they are today. Especially housing and food.

>Insults won't change the fact that you plan to force them to give up a lot in exchange for nothing, and then you're surprised why they may not think that's a great plan. If they'd be down with ""let's all give up our standard of living to save the world"", they'd be doing that already. They've considered global poverty, and they've decided that's not their responsibility to solve.

So your argument here is ""people don't wanna give up their comfortable lifestyles, let's not help poor people"". How about when we assign the same logic to just one country, rich versus poor? Without taxes redistributing money and equalising us, we'd be pretty fucked. We'd be under essentially Feudalism instead of democracy.

>You're planning to take away the property from the people, both individually and collectively, and hand it to a globalist superstate, for the benefit of the poor.

Well that is A. Not even close to what I want, which shows how much you've been listening, and B. Not communism, or socialism, OR Marxism. At best it's state-capitalism/state-socialism, with a historical basis in the Soviets, who once again, were not communists.

>Yes, and... it is. The labor theory of value is wrong. Completely

Which actually isn't even relevant to the overarching basis of the theory. It doesn't affect the pragmatism of the theory if you simply remove that part of it. It's an extra. In addition it isn;t ""completely"" wrong at all. I'll admit it isn't accurate but to say no aspect of it is correct is also false. The price of a good is somewhat determined by how much it costed to make, although also within the boundaries of how much people are willing to pay.

>But that doesn't ignore that you need dictatorships to force communism on the people or they'll tell you go fuck yourself at the first opportunity.

No you don't. Fucking Workers Unions being given more power is closer to socialism than a dictatorship. Cooperative businesses are closer to socialism. All perfectly within our grasp without an uprising or a dictatorship. In fact, without the involvement of the government at all, which is exactly what Karl Marx envisioned. Socialism does not require a government to be formed. I believe there still should be a government, but socialism does not need one, it needs people to set up Unions and Cooperatives.

>You're acting like ""the rich"" sit in their towers atop a mountain of cash, laughing at the plight of the dirty peons below. That's not how it works. Their money is invested, and it is so globally already. 

The rich save more money than any other economic group. I doubt that comes as any surprise. Money is literally the lifeblood of an economy, if it stops moving, parts of an economy die. Money needs to be moving, otherwise it is worthless, and when large amounts of money is saved, like in massive offshore bank accounts to avoid tax, or even taxed money that simply isn't spent, it is worthless. Of course they reinvest SOME of it into an economy, but why do you think they do that? To extract MORE money from people, MORE value. Eventually results in the near oligopolies in too many industries we have today (banking, food, pharmaceuticals, internet providers, electricity providers).

>Which, by the way, has done more against poverty than anything else.

You realise I do not disagree with investing in an economy right? You know that's not what socialism is right? The idea is simply to give the average man power over the businesses he works for, to gain a greater bargaining position. Money that is in the hands of people who aren't quite as wealth as the top 1% doesn't just disappear from an economy, in fact the middle-class set up the most business compared with the rich. People lower down in the class system are more likely to spend that money on things of value, than rich people are

>Turns out working harder doesn't mean shit. Again: The labor theory of value is wrong.

I don't even really get what you're saying here, sounds more like just a simple jeer against socialism. Are you trying to say working hard is a bad thing and you should be rich instead so you can earn money by hiring other people to make money for you?"

"> you obviously think Apple has invented all that stuff because you aren't familiar with other technologies

Sheesh, condescending much? There are definitely points to be had for some people in implementation. Apples philosophy (and it isn't right or wrong, it just is) is minimalistic. Scrap anything that isn't stupidly simple and elegant and useful. Only implement what's minimally necessary. For what users need to do what they want. All the niche bells and whistles get cut. 

Android is the opposite. Get it out, fail fast and iterate. There are markets that value those things differently. Neither one is braindead or stupid out of necessity. 

Back on track though, the point is that sometimes apple has features that android has had, but in my opinion, their implementation is usually better. Not always, but sometimes.

This is misguided advice and quite detrimental in my opinion. OP has identified a weaker area of his at work and is wondering how best to combat it- he's not jumping to the conclusion that he needs to be medicated lol, you sound very condescending.

Being weaker at presenting is not much different than being weak at building a presentation, performing analysis, stakeholder management, etc etc as all are skills that can be improved.

Basically, OP's issue is a fairly common one. He is probably assuming other people that appear calm while presenting are 'naturals', wheras very often they too have had to practice and overcome issues that had at one point in time.

I would say read about the issue to understand where its coming from, and then take an active approach to improve at it through deliberate practice. Join a club like Toastmasters, or pay for a coach to give you some lessons to give you foundational skills for improving. And practice all the time. If you wait around for the issue to just fix itself magically so you become like Steve Jobs delivering a keynote presentation without putting in effort than you will be disappointed.

Women suffer gendered violence at alarming rates.

All around them there's a culture and other men and women who blames the victim, or mildly acknowledges their suffering only to dismiss it shortly thereafter like you did. 

The focus is kept on the man and his feelings and what he needs. 

It's a focus that paints the man as someone needing excuses, compassion, help, not to be treated as the criminal he is.

It's a focus that tells women their suffering is ""bad"" but really in the larger scheme of things it's much more productive to be compassionate to the man causing her suffering.

It's a focus that erases the real victim and her pain - because really she doesn't matter as much as the man.

Passion takes a lot of different forms though. It can be an intense interest in a particular field of study or endeavor (e.g. a passion for science, art, invention, etc.). It can take the form of irrational impulses such as rage (e.g. a crime of passion). And it can mean a whole bunch of other things in between those extremes.

Therefore, again IMHO, it makes no sense to speak of passion as unambiguously ""good"" or ""evil"". It's a needlessly dualistic (and thus reductionist) point of view.

I believe that anyone who has reached the top of their profession should be rewarded financially for having done so.

There is an absurd amount of profit being generated, hence I think it's reasonable that those who have sucessfully cultivated the enormous level of skill required to make this possible should benefit financially.

That said, they weren't really responsible adults when they chose to go into the industry. It isn't a very responsible move, given the enormous risk, except in the rare exceptions where someone is looking at a large signing bonus. Even then, except in the extreme situations, those earnings are reasonable next to the level of success and resources invested in getting even that far.

No, what I said was that I'm not convinced it led to policy changes. You're making the post hoc, ergo procter hoc mistake; just because a reform chronologically followed BLM, that doesn't imply that BLM either caused it or caused it an an efficacious or ultimately productive manner. To put it another way: not only am I unconvinced that BLM produced that reform, if I were convinced it was, I would still be pointing out the flaw in the method that made it take longer and incur a much higher cost than it was worth.

>Short history lesson.

Why you felt the need to be so condescending is beyond me. I'm going to go ahead and say the two laws had the greatest effect and point out that by their nature, those laws were lobbied for in Congress. That's how they came to be. We like to romanticize movements and believe they had intrinsic value (sometimes they do), but it's all fairly meaningless if it doesn't change the way power is actually exercised. If there had been no Civil Rights Act and the Civil Rights Movement had just faded away, it'd be worth very little outside of a history class. If the Boston Tea Party hadn't been part of a chain of events that led to revolution and statehood, it would just be a bunch of dorks dressed up like Indians throwing tea in the ocean.

To match your history lesson, let me offer a philosophy lesson given to me before I received a degree in history: history never repeats itself. I suggest you look into The Poverty of Historicism by Karl Popper. The short version as it pertains to this subject: looking back and saying ""then is like now!"" and trying to use that false insight to predict the future is not only a bad idea that'll lead to shitty predictions, it has produced some of the worst ideologies humans have yet cobbled together. The moment you're telling yourself that some predictive framework is being nicely filled in by the events you see is the moment you're about to be blindsided by factors you failed to account for.

For example: you might have failed to account for the fact that the party most sympathetic to your cause has been getting its teeth kicked in from the school board to the Presidency for the past 6 years while BLM et al were stridently demonstrating. You want to talk about bottom-up change? Republicans have been smoke checking Democrats on local politics and grassroots organizing; they copied the Democrat playbook and now they hold most power in the country at every level. If your goal is some kind of legislative action, you are measurably farther from that goal than you were in 2014 despite these movements.

That's not the case, and frankly it seems like you're trying to shoehorn my position into whatever box you're prepared to argue against. I'm specifically saying a different form of concerted activism is needed, not that people should stop doing anything or just let things work themselves out.

>The basic premise of your post is based on the specious assumption that if something does not have your conservative stamp of approval, it must be objectively useless or not optimal in its functionality.

No it isn't; that's patently absurd and you're dressing my position up as other positions you've argued against on this sub in the past. I'm not saying something like ""violent protests don't solve anything, you should protest peacefully so I can ignore you."" I'm saying the protests are a waste of time and energy no matter their character (also, the vapidity of some of these protests annoys me). They aren't working and they're arguably making it less likely that goals will be achieved. I'm not saying that's fair or right, I'm saying that's how it is.

I never said anything about anyone's approval, I exclusively discussed effectiveness in achieving goals and asked for milestones that mark success worthy of movements - laws in particular. My argument from the beginning was that protesting in the manner of OWS and BLM is a poor exercise of power that achieves paltry success at best - not that it's wrong or evil, that it just doesn't work with those issues in this society at this time.

Ok. Christian anarchism doesn't deny the Bible as a whole, although it does discredit several of the books of the Bible. Even if you do believe in the Bible, everything it says is up for interpretation. Creationism is not a fundamental concept of Christianity. Creationism is a literal interpretation of the creation story stated in Genesis, and even miniscule study of the Bible reveals that its books rarely speak literally. As I'm sure you know, the book of Genesis was not written by God and the same is true for the whole Bible. If you didn’t know that, you can look into that yourself, but to get back on topic, the book of Genesis was written by Moses with knowledge and eyewitness testimony passed down by Adam, Noah, Abraham, Enoch, Isaac, and Jacob.

Both total hawks and the inane ‘anti-imperialist’ crowd will probably get half of things right - by seeing it as purely always right or wrong, they will be both right and wrong, circumstance dependent. Does that justify either of such grouping positions? No of course it doesn’t, being wrong 50% of the time isn’t something to be proud of.

Corbyn has no moral standing in foreign policy, nor do the people which believe every conflict can be solved with boots on the ground."
"Basically, you're getting really defensive and calling me names because I called you out on a poorly thought out opinion that you gave in a place on the internet filled with people who like the IP of the thing in which you're bashing... and your opinion on the quality was never asked for...

>Do you want an opinion disclaimer every time someone makes a subjective claims?

Without context, you can come across as a troll with a broad opinion like that without any reasoning behind it. It's the internet and we communicate in type, it's not easy to understand thinks like inflection and intention. That being the case, I don't think it's hard to differentiate when you're giving an opinion and basing it on actual reason rather than making a sweeping generalization about something as subjective as quality. You say it's silly to think people shouldn't understand it's just your opinion, but we deal with people who do nothing more than make statements like this just to be dicks, how are we to know you aren't one of those people if you don't explain yourself? You have revealed far more intelligence than your original point gave, and I appreciate that. Thank you for actually going into detail.

>Did you think about the implications of what you're saying?

Don't be so condescending if you want to have a dialog. Your whole comment is pretty off-putting and arrogant. However, I think understand where you are saying so I'll try to respond to that.

I think there is a scale with complete anarchy on one side and Orwellian order on the other. I believe that by completely removing the immediate consequence of physical violence a society pushes itself too far into the Orwellian camp. And in that camp people can abuse the lack of consequence (i.e be a dick)

I agree that it would be dangerous to have a policy in place that says it is okay to assault someone, and I'm not advocating that. However I think that if a zero tolerance policy is perfectly enforced and does not also include a compensatory policy to discourage people from non-physical forms of violence then peoples personal sovereignty will be infringed on by those who know they can do anything and 'get away with it.' As a pre-emptive aside, I do not believe that civil litigation is an effective deterrent in nearly all cases where a brawl would resolve the issue.

Also anytime there is a zero tolerance anything, I think you should take a serious look at that. There is almost nothing that should be zero-tolerance, because I believe that in the majority of cases they do more harm than good. If your goals are to maximize 'good' then a zero-tolerance policy should not be a part of your common tool-set.

I think the Top-Gear incident is an excellent demonstration of the point. The guy who was punched dropped it. The crew dropped it. The only people who care about this incident are those who are zealously enforcing the zero-tolerance policy, and because of that people who want to make Top-Gear are not, and people who want to watch Top-Gear can't.

"> You don't understand the meaning of the word ""capital"", and I'm hesitant about whether you know the meaning of the word ""supply"", so first I'm going to clarify the meaning of the word ""demand"".

Oh come on now. There's no need for that condescending tone my friend. You can't act like a word as unspecific as 'capital' has but one common definition, that yours is the only one, and all others are simple wrong. I would define it as:

Capital = wealth used in the production of more wealth

The way I was using supply and demand, they each mean the wealth that is being used to make some sort of voluntary exchange. In each exchange there are two parties who are exchanging wealth; with reverse preference valuations I'd add. They each are using their supply of wealth to demand wealth from another.

> Demand is the willingness or ability to buy a product at some point in time.

Right, well that's part of it. The way I use the term the demand is really the wealth that you're using to go along with your willingness. I think the willingness portion of the definition is unnecessary because if you're wanting to do the action, and you're free, then you'd just take that action. So the real focus should just be on your means, or the wealth to demand something with.

> The ability part signifies that you have something to trade for that product

Yeah. That's the part I'm focusing on. Whether or not we have enough wealth.

> Supply is the amount of a product that producers can sell at a given time, if they are willing. What determines the supply? The producers' capital, which are the goods that a producer needs to supply a product (without being used up utterly). In the case where the product supplied is apples, capital may include apple trees, for loans, cash on hand.

Supply is that which you have to demand other wealth with. So yes, if you're an apple farmer then it's likely the bulk of the capital (again, see my definition above) you'll be exchanging will be apples.

> A ""lack of demand"" can mean one of two things, given the definition of demand: a lack of ability or a lack of willingness to buy a product (at a given price, that is). Who does this affect? People who are trying to sell apples. Not people who are trying to buy apples! Since people are either unable to afford as many apples as they like or already have as many apples as they want (if not more), prices fall, because otherwise people who sell apples will not sell enough apples to buy another product that they, in turn, need.

A lack of demand means that people aren't having a lot of luck getting into voluntary exchanges with others. The cause of that is from people having a delusional price in mind for what they want to sell their capital for... they need to lower their prices if they want to get into exchanges. Seems like we're pretty much in agreement on this one.

> So the transaction itself does not improve production of any good, but instead merely redistributes wealth.

Why such loaded terminology? The transferring of wealth voluntarily is a vital economic function... without it, you don't actually have an economy. The reason why wealth was ""gained"" was that what I was storing my wealth in has now risen in value by my countrymen since the time when I first exchanged for it. That is not anything to scoff at, that's what's happened.

> Since the original owners of that wealth are just as able to spend money as I am (this neglects transaction costs, which is a standard assumption), how is my willingness to buy goods different from their willingness to buy goods?

It's not any different. We can both likely exchange this wealth for other wealth that is of equal value for consumption, but that has nothing to do with why that voluntary exchange beforehand was , in your words, merely a redistribution.

> If there's no difference, it means there's no difference in demand OR supply. Is this valuable economic activity?

Yes, most certainly! That voluntary exchange served a vital function. Firstly, it moved both parties into a more preferred state. Secondly, if we were planning on using this wealth as capital, in order to create yet more wealth, then during that exchange we each demonstrated what we thought our alternative use of that capital would be. The man that thought the alternative use was higher is the man that walked away from that exchange with it. Lastly, the fact that afterwards the value of that capital did indeed rise is a verification by society that the one man was right and the other wrong on what he thought alternative uses of that capital may be. So what has transpired here is capital has moved from hands that didn't anticipate the demands of society very well, to those who did a better job anticipating demands of society.

> One way in which it can differ is that since you're a farmer, you have no demand for food because you will grow all the food you need (and therefore don't BUY any from anyone else). However, I am not a farmer, and I buy your food from you cheap, since your supply of food is very plentiful.

Right. A unit of capital is more highly valued when you have less of it. It's because you have greater incentive to exchange a particular piece of capital (an apple), for a different type of capital (orange), if you have lots of it (lots of apples).

> I can then sell that food to others who have a demand for food as well, and pocket the difference, since I had the money to buy all your food first, which was entirely paid back later.

Sorry, what are you saying there? You are able to exchange your wealth for other people's wealth, yes. I don't quite follow what you were trying to say; I was lost on the ""which was entirely paid back later"" portion and how that ties in.

> Out of everyone who buys apples cheap and sells them dear, unless they're taking money from people who aren't doing this, someone ends up buying them extremely expensively and having to sell it off for damn cheap.

Correct. That would happen if someone was very far off on what they thought the value of something would be in the future. He would have badly assessed how much people really want that which he's storing his wealth in. As such, he will need to drop his price in order to exchange it for other wealth.

> As you correctly point out, they are providing a useful service: they earn money from improper pricing, and therefore fix the prices of things to correct levels.

The pricing wasn't improper in the sense that on that particular day, in that particular time, that was the right price. That's what people thought it was worth. The fact that the new price a couple days later, or a couple years later, is different just means the thoughts on this capital's value have changed. This new price is as 'correct' as the old price... they're both a reflection of what society thinks this capital is worth at that particular time. If you are good at anticipating the demands of what the consumers will want in the future, then you can exchange your wealth for that wealth before the change in public opinion occurs so that you have more wealth afterwards with which to anticipate consumer demands yet again moving further into the future.

> But they are also moving money away from other people.

Yes, other people are giving them their wealth because they want what he has. Again, this is because he is good at anticipating the future demands of society. That's how he found himself in such a position in the first place. We shouldn't prevent these people from giving their wealth to him and exchanging with him if that's what they want to do.

> The concern is that the amount of money flowing from producers to people who are not producers is crippling the demand for goods because people who want goods can't afford them.

We are all wealth producers (assuming you earn your wealth through voluntary exchanges) and wealth consumers (assuming you eat food at all). So not that many people should fall under the ""produce nothing at all"" category and everyone falls under the ""consume something"" category.

But why is demand crippled? Demand is only crippled at those high delusional prices. The owner of the wealth will not be able to exchange it for other wealth unless the price drops. As soon as he lowers his price he will suddenly find that demand. At the same time, people will now find that wealth more affordable. I do not understand what concern you're talking about exactly. Please explain what you mean."

That's precisely what I did, and /u/Mi_Pasta_Su_Pasta, the person you were arguing with, defined fault as blame, not character flaw. I've demonstrated this by exchanging fault for at fault in his sentence without changing the intended meaning, that was clearly established by context.

There are legitimate arguments against the voting for (or legitimizing the illegitimate) an office that is ever expanding, always unyielding, no matter who is president.

He was a classical liberal stalwart before and after office, and a sellout while he was the president.

You have a billion dollar fund to prove that your predictive powers should be listened to?

Quite frankly: you sound ignorant. Let me explain a small bit of why your condescension against Whatsapp is misplaced. 

Facebook, one of the world leaders in networking and delivering software services to over a billion people as seamlessly as possible, bought a networking service that scaled up to 500,000,000 monthly active users, and scale up that far faster than any other service to date, including Facebook_. 

Do you know how many software shops exist in this world full of staff that can run a network that handles 500,000,000 active users?

Do you know how many men are alive who have hands on experiencing scaling network software to run 500,000,000 active users?

There is a reason Facebook paid $4 billion to retain the employees of Whatsapp, and it's the same reason they bought Whatapp.

It's the same reason NASA's ex-engineers get bought up by Musk's SpaceX company at almost any price.

You can barely put a price on experience that is that rare. Any of us Joe Schmoes could put together some shoddy ""web app"" that might get a few thousand active users before it crumbles in on itself (see: reddit touch of death). But 500 million people? Hitting one service? It's ridiculous to condescend towards the value of that skill. 

The Facebook acquisition makes PERFECT sense if you understand Facebook and Whatsapp and what Facebook wants from them. They want to own as much of the talent as possible that understands how to bring a software service to a billion people simultaneously."

So you're telling me that developers are free to interpret the genre as they choose, just as long as the players who play it don't? Why are the developers who treat this as shooter-first discounted, but the ones who treat it as RPG-first not? Simply because their opinions don't match up with yours? Funny coincidence, that...

The beta intro video linked above isn't a random developer's off-the-cuff statement-- it was a pre-recorded heavily produced script that likely went through plenty of PR and marketing edits prior to being released to the public. Their conclusion from these edits was that the first thing you should know about the game is that it is a ""cover based shooter"". You simply cannot discount the shooter portion of this game as a small part. It is a shooter RPG.

> which really feels like the game you're looking for.

I don't pretend to tell you what kind of game you're looking for, don't do me the service of telling me what I want either. I love The Division. I never asked for a tactical shooter. If you read my comments above, I was fairly clear about that.

But look, by contrast, there are plenty of non-shooter RPG games out there with a much stronger focus on RPG elements, like WoW and SW:TOR. The Division's emphasis on gun based weapons and precision based real-time aiming diverts it from being a mere MMORPG game, which really feels like the game you're looking for.

See, it feels just as ridiculously condescending when flipped around on you. I actually feel pretty dumb for even going through that exercise, because I know how misleading the above statement is, just as I know how misleading yours was.

> ""...kind of like the glass cannon"" doesn't sound to me like confirmation of specific builds; rather, it sounds like this guy using a commonly understood term to describe his preferred play style

This is exactly what a ""commonly understood term"" is for. He is using language to describe a play style that is synonymous with the lengthy description. If discussing semantics of English is bothersome, just listen to the three sentences prior to the summation to understand the full context of the discussion (hopefully you did this)-- him and I were discussing the same build. Focusing on weapon damage to use a sniper and scope from afar. These are all his words, and incidentally, all of mine. If calling it a ""glass cannon"" is really that troublesome, call it whatever the heck you want-- the point is that this play style is broken.

It seems to me like you are having a hard time understanding nuance. Just because certain players want damage increased on certain play styles does not mean they are asking for one shot kills, or that they want to play CoD. Stripping down a nuanced argument to oversimplified conclusions is really unproductive. I never once mentioned that I wanted one shot kills (feel free to find the quote if you think I have), in fact, my actual conclusion was that an extra 10-15% damage would be sufficient. Please explain to me how this translates into: ""obviously this kid just wants to play CoD""?

I get a similar vibe from your comment. I think it's the way you assume I just don't understand what happens when you don't bend over for one party or the other. I will vote for the candidate that earns my vote and I think that's fair."

">false analogy, red herring, wtf.

Just calling it these things doesn't make it so. The analogy is fine. You are saying we should treat humans well but not other animals because animals are not human. That is a non-sequitur, and exactly the same argument as my comparison.

You may have better arguments, but you have not presented them. Maybe you should consider doing so before calling others retarded for not accepting your ""because I say so""-immaturity.

>humans are not the same species as other animals, therefore we do not treat them as though they were.

This was never in question, please don't make stuff up.

>animals are a resource

Again, not an actual argument. What is a resource? In a sense, humans are resources too, because we use parts of them for transplants, research, etc - but how does that entail how you treat either, when we/they are also living, feeling creatures?

>you need to get out more, or watch more nature shows, shit is brutal. 

Condescending statement with no relevance to the discussed. I am aware that nature is brutal, and have already said so. What's more, I also responded to it: In almost every sense we are trying to move away from nature, exactly because nature lacks morality.

Rape is natural and even beneficial in a strictly natural, amoral sense. Do you support rape?

>""moral"" treatment of animals leads to an inefficiency

Of course, and so does not raping humans. More rape means more babies, more babies means more labour. 
Since so few people seem to understand analogies, I have to stress that I'm not equating rape to not caring about animals - it is merely used to show that efficiency doesn't invalidate moral concerns. If you want to show that it does in this particular case, you will need to argue that.

>Our culturally learned behaviors make us different

If we're going there, I would say one of the most important culturally learned behaviours we have is the ability to distance ourselves from instincts and cold nature, and feel empathy not just for ourselves but for other species as well. You're trying to remove that.

>we do however have mastery over all other creatures

""Mastery"" sounds so religious. Our technology puts us at the highest point on the food chain, at least here in the west - but ask a poor African person if he feels he has mastery over the nearest lion. This, however, has absolutely no relevance to the topic. Mastery does not absolve you of compassion or empathy towards your subjects.

>My point is we need to treat humans humanely, because we are all humans

That's still not an argument. You are still saying ""humans should be treated better than other animals because they are human"", which is the same as ""whites should be treated better than blacks because they are whites"". It's a non-sequitur. There is no connection.

>that is what I believe is the right thing to do

And finally we get to the actual point. You believe that's the right thing. That's okay, you can have your own opinion. Personally I find it very hypocritical and immoral, but as I said, it's an emotional argument. We can't really speak rationally when it comes to feelings and empathy."

So wait, who is acting like the 14 year old here? 

>Also, just adding a ""y"" to it doesn't make calling me a bitch any better. There is no need to insult me.

Here's yet another English lesson. Someone can be bitchy without being a bitch. You were, in my opinion, being bitchy. Your attitude was completely childish, unnecessarily condescending, and snarky. In short, bitchy. Does this mean I think you're a bitch? Maybe, or maybe not. But I did not call you a bitch at any point in time. I, unlike yourself, try not to make personal attacks against people for no good reason, especially based on reading 1-2 things they've said on an internet discussion forum. For future reference, if you don't want to be called bitchy then maybe you could, I dunno, stop being bitchy? Just a thought. 

Look, you're getting too wrapped up in the whole rape issue to think about this logically. Let me use a different example. If I show up to your house wearing muddy boots, and you asked me to take them off, and instead I run inside and jump up and down on your couch, getting mud all over it, well then that would make me a pretty big asshole. You would have every right to be pissed off at me. You might even want to tell your friends about what a massive asshole I was. But, if while recounting the events of the story, you decided to tell them that you expressly forbade me from jumping on your couch with muddy shoes on, then you would be a fucking liar. Because you didn't. Sure, it was implied that you probably didn't want me to do it, both by you asking me to take my shoes off and by the simple common sense that most people don't enjoy having mud on their furniture. But that doesn't change the fact that at no point did you expressly forbid me to do that particular act. It simply didn't happen. Just like in the story that the OP told. 

The fact of the matter is that the word expressly has a definition. And you've yet to actually use that word in the context of that actual definition, and in fact have used it in the opposing manner of that definition. Feel free to argue all you want about how angry it would make you if someone fucked you without a condom, if that's rape, etc. I don't care. But you're absolutely 100%, no questions asked wrong about the OP's original story containing a passage where the woman expressly forbids the guy from fucking her with no condom. It expressly isn't there (see, I used the word properly for you so now you know how it should work). 

>What do you think ""explicitly"" forbidding someone to not put a condom on would sound like.

Well lets see. ""explicitly"" means ""leaving nothing merely implied"", and ""forbidding"" means to tell someone not to do something. So I would think that if at any point the word no, or stop, or literally anything that actually clearly relayed the message that he wasn't supposed to continue would qualify. Note that at no point have I said that just because she didn't expressly forbid him to continue that it was ok for him to, or that it wouldn't have been a violation. I do still think that and said as much. But she most definitely didn't forbid it in any way. Certainly not expressly or explicitly.

What difference does that make? If something works on a small scale, who's to say it won't work with lots of different small scales? Just because something may not work on a country-wide (i.e. Government) scale doesn't mean it's bad. I don't think we should have a government at all, frankly because it's unnecessary."

Because that's speaking in about in general. Economists believe free trade is generally better than restricted trade. That's something I even stated. What they don't believe is that it's always better. In instance with regulatory imbalances it can create serious problems, and China is one such example.

Nor is that statement ""provable"" using a single study that doesn't actually ask that question. It's actually cringe worthy how illiterate your comment was given your condescending tone lol.

> Django's trunk is remarkably stable

You're using the term ""stable"" incorrectly. It may be stable in so far as features that go into it are really really well tested and documented, but the fact that there are features going into it means it's not stable.

When software is deployed and relies on another piece of software, you need to specify the particular version(s) of that software you've tested against. Specifying `HEAD` of trunk is unwise since you're specifying a moving target.

In the case of Django, that may well mean snapshotting a specific revision from trunk that you've tested.

PS: AFAIK, Debian packages 0.95.1 in stable and 0.96 in testing/unstable. Ubuntu is slightly more up to date and packages 0.96.1. What exactly did you mean when you said Debian deploys Django's trunk?"

Yeah, I understand that trans people face lots of crap. However, it's a little bit disheartening to have people make vile assumptions about everybody's intentions. If something is ambiguous, the logical next step is to ask for clarification, not to assume the worst.

As far as the test goes, not only does this require more data, it also requires scientifically correctly collected data. This can not be done by Geekbench, because the data is user submitted. Everybody sets up their phone differently and uses it in a different environment with different temperatures, etc.

What comes with the silicon lottery is that every single CPU produced has a varying performance and potential. Manufacturers/Apple can set a certain speed/performance that each chip is supposed to achieved and get rid of the ones that perform below that. This does not only count for a phone's SOC, this also counts for every single other chip and part that's used to build the phone- ranging from the display, to the RAM, to the battery. Every single part in the phone offers varying performance to a certain extent. That's the nature of the production process.

What you would have to do is get two equally calibrated phones (one for the Samsung and one for TSMC chip, as the difference in size makes it impossible to put one chip on the board of the other) and a ton of Sammy/TSMC SOCs for the test and then only switch out the SOC after every test run (the results will also be affected by the soldering job). That's the way to get comparable data, but even then, your test results will only show numbers specific to those two test phones.

A regular user submitted collection of benchmark data like Geekbench cannot do this.

Do their numbers hint at a difference? Yes, but it cannot tell you how big or marginal the difference is. Geekbench also stresses the CPU more than apps and the majority of games do. It doesn't compare to how people use their phones. You don't constantly run benchmarks on your phone, every single day."

No need to be condescending. I vote left wing and to write off this opinion in its entirety is what creates an echo chamber.

Honestly, if I lived in a world where literally every other person in the world earns more than me, I'd probably want to kill myself. I think this example is designed in an ideological world where everyone in the world is holding hands and at peace with the way that they live: however, you cannot ignore the fact that everyone would come to expect a certain standard of living and you would be the only person not being able to match their social norms.

Shaming people for choosing World B ignores the fact that we are social creatures and a significant portion of self-worth is placed on social status. If this were not true, then I'm not quite sure how you could explain cliques in rich schools where the poor and the rich are segregated in their friendships. It also ignores ramifications of the economy which would make $110k the equivalent of poverty.

On the flipside, choosing World A is perhaps inherent selfish, but that $15k difference is barely anything when compared to the $90k difference before. I'd probably even bury it in a hole just to make the world actually all $85k a year.

But the idea of a gofundme being set up to fund this one poor fucker earning $110k per year is just disturbing and embarrassing.

">Is this your first year watching the Ravens? You only have to go back a couple of years and give Joe half competent offensive core and a actual line and he had MANY great years. 

Besides that amazing 4 game playoff run and one year under Kubes, Flacco has been below average and the model of inconsistency. He has some scary stats during that time. I believe he holds two of the lowest QBR games ever for a QB, he's never had over a 100 passer rating for 4 games besides that playoff run. Not even under Kubes. 

>JMac got dropped by KC.... He isn't the weapon

>Mike best receiver in the league at one point? That is a joke.

No, that's not a joke at all. Were you not watching football during Wallace's prime? In 2010 he led the league in yards per catch, he was 3rd in total receiving yards and he did it with almost half the receptions of 1st place (Roddy White) who only beat him by less than 100 yards. You look foolish being condescending when the facts suggest you don't know what you're talking about.

>You are taking a small example of Joe checking it down. 

Small sample? You realize that one of Joe's nicknames for other fanbases is ""Captain Checkdown""??? You don't get that from one or two games of checkdowns. Everyone knows that Joe is prone to checking it down. Joe checked it down on 4th and 28 to Ray Rice... One of the dumbest decisions in history, but he got bailed out by Rice making a miraculous play. 

Joe Flacco has the worst stat line out of any franchise QB in the league. He was good for 4 games, and then rode Kubes to a solid season, but has never come anywhere close to that. He's not good. Every other fanbase in all of the NFL sees it, he's the definition of inconsistent. Non-bias people think Joe Flacco is a very bad QB, only Ravens fans disagree. And how good is a QB if he needs everything to go absolutely perfect for him to not look bad?"
">I can't even imagine what sort of gymnastics you have to pull to get those ideas.

The gymnastics of truth, man. Seriously though, I didn't get the memo that we are starting our replies with a condescending and dismissive tone. Anyway, on to the substance.

Sources:

[OECD graphs (via NYT) breakdown of health spending and outcomes of developed coutnries]( http 

[The US is a decided outlier in both healthcare costs and lack of public insurance among developed nations. This cannot be attributed to substantially different outcomes or quality of care, but is correlated with higher costs for identical services and procedures rendered.] ( http 

Medicare is more efficient than private health insurance. Medicare (public insurance) has over and over again been shown to have lower overhead and better long term cost controls when compared to private health insurance in the US.

>Lasik, a procedure typically not covered by insurance, has gone down in cost over time, while the bulk of medical costs continually rise.

Apples and Oranges. Lasik is a relatively new procedure, and it is inevitable that as techniques and technology improve the costs would go down. Most important LASIK is an elective procedure. This is an entirely different market than, say, chemotherapy or even a surgery necessary to maintain quality of life like a hip replacement. Providers can charge you exorbitant costs on necessary procedures because the cost of saying no is too high for the consumer. Hospitals and other health care companies hold too much leverage over you when your life or quality of life is on the line, whereas this is never the case with elective procedures. You can have LASIK whenever you want (unlike in urgent health interventions), or, like me, decide you don't really mind wearing corrective lenses and never undergo the procedure. On the other hand tens of thousands of Americans go bankrupt every year from medical bills.


>I also wouldn't even call health insurance in the US ""private"" with how much the government is involved, but anyhow why is it a failure to you?

Health insurance in the US is provided by many groups, most of which are private insurers. From wikipedia: in 2010 27.4% of the US was covered by public programs (medicare, medicaid, VA and other military health care), while ~67% were covered by private programs.

I believe our system is a failure largely because of the disproportionate high costs that come with this system when compared to all the developed nations that utilize entirely or mostly public health insurance.

> If you believe that government is capable of efficient provision of goods and services, do you have any objection to the government just making and running everything?

The slippery slope argument is nonsense, since I nowhere advocated for a communist state. At the same time realize it is dogmatic libertarian belief on your part if you think the government is never capable of efficiently providing goods and services. Healthcare is perhaps the best example, but there are many examples of efficient government programs in developed countries. The best examples are usually those that step in to create a social safety net or public goods where private enterprise wouldn't because there is no profit motive. All the same such programs benefit society because without them there are real negative economic externalities (in the case of health care these manifest as a sick labor force, diseases, and lack of medical research."

Great, you do you. This is just me, but on the rare occasions that I seek out discussion on a new game I'd just picked up for the first time, I might go and read some discussions on specific subs for that game, look up old reviews on IGN (back when that site wasn't a pile of horse manure) or in scans of old gaming mags, maybe check out what's on GameFAQs or in the citations linked to a Wikipedia article. I might even check to see if any of the Youtube channels I sub to have reviewed it. A generic retro gaming sub like this one is pretty low on my list of places to go for game-specific discussion TBH, because it's just too generic.

Not to mention, gamers are quite particular about what reviews they read. We all have our preferred outlets for reviews that we like, and some random dude on the Internet is probably not one of them. Just check out the levels of discussion at /r/gamereviews - almost 5000 subs with hundreds of reviews from a variety of sources, yet nothing ever gets commented on, and that's typically for modern games that have a lot more relevance.

"> Perk skills come down to personal preference

This is where you're wrong. For most perks certain skills are always objectively better than their counterparts.

""Impact Rounds"" allow a Commando to solo Scrakes and Fleshpounds more reliably without taking off-perk weapons. ""Concussion Rounds"" are absolutely necessary for a Support Specialist, because one of its roles is taking down large zeds, and proper takedowns for Support rely on the ""Stumble"" affliction. It also allows a Support to stop a raging Fleshpound with a DBS alt-fire headshot (another role - tanking).

> I also don't think it's reasonable to assume that I'm ""inexperienced"" just because I find use in other skills which fit my play style

It is perfectly reasonable, because as you progress as a player, you'll notice that quite a number of skills and weapons are unconditionably bad, no matter which playstyle you choose, and some of the things listed in the original comment are indicators of inexperience (no experienced Support who knows how this perk works would ever take ""Resupply Pack"" over ""Concussion Rounds"" during combat time, for example).

Or because I worked QA for several AAA games for 3 years on contract, and now have a design gig at one of those places, not using UE4 for our project though. Its cool your studio with like 10-20 people can run daily QA tests, however with the scope of a AAA game that isn't possible because no one plans for it until at the end of a 4 or 5 year development cycle.

Breeders, from what I gather, are irresponsible people who have kid after kid after kid even though they can't afford them because BAYBEEEEZZZZ!!!! And often times, they also choose not to discipline their little snotlings and let them run around doing whatever under the guise that parenting is SO HARD. I fail to see how this is at all equivalent or relevant to the argument of exclusively indoor vs indoor/outdoor cats. 

Most of us owners are not fucking morons. We UNDERSTAND the risk of letting our cats be outside just as people who smoke/drink understand the risk of what they are doing and choose to do it anyway. 

Should people really be smoking? No. Do they? Yes. 

Should people really only have house cats? Probably. Do they all? No. Like with your previous smoking example, it is THEIR CHOICE to let their pets outside.

The argument that ""women have it worse so we should focus on women's issues only"" is invalidating men's issues because of women's issues.

> Umm, pretty sure if one group is disadvantaged and another group is not that puts the group that's not disadvantaged at an advantage. That's kind of how things work. 

Only in a zero-sum game. Society is not a zero-sum game. A group benefiting does not necessarily make another group lose. Yes, comparatively speaking, one group 'wins' and the other 'loses' but to view society as men vs women is inherently hateful. 

Let me pose an example. If a gay person gains the right to marry, that in no way disadvantages me and only benefits the gay person. However, if we compare my situation vs theirs, I have now 'lost' because now they are better off than before. I'm sure you're not going to argue that women lose when gay people are able to marry? Viewing things through comparison of one group against the other, in terms of rights, leads to hate. 

> Or it's a recognition of the current power balance in the world we live in and trying to direct the response to the root of the problem rather than just trying to enforce some false equality.

Regardless of the 'power balance', approaching every issue as a women's issue only enforces the gender stereotypes that you oppose, not dismantles them. Regardless of the 'power balance' there are issues that affect men primarily or exclusively and so need to be approached that way and approaching them as women's issues leads to ineffective solutions or even actively harms men. 

There is no 'ideal outcome' when it comes to complex societal issues. No solution is going to fully solve an issue or have no issues associated with it. Having a static 'women are victims' approach is definitely not going to solve anything. 

> Social pressure is incredibly powerful

I definitely agree. However, there are people who do things despite social pressure and so social pressure is not a complete solution. Laws and policies are there to protect against those people so proposing social pressure as an alternative solution to policies is ineffective. 

Also, there is already incredible social pressure to not do negative things. Think about it - would you associate with a proven rapist? Someone who has been proven to falsely accuse of rape? There is lots of pressure among men against sexual violence, in most circles. Yes, social pressure reduces the rates of these things but it does nothing to protect people who would suffer from these things.

> [men's and women's rights are] the same fucking thing

I disagree. There is lots of overlap in issues that men and women face but fundamentally there are issues which affect men and not women, or women and not men. Approaching every one of these issues as exclusively women's (as feminism tries to do) is counter productive and harms men. 

> Want men's rights? Support feminism, which is about putting men and women on equal footing

The issue is that feminism has repeatedly failed to approach men's issues. Workplace deaths, paternity fraud, suicide, boys falling behind in education, custody and etc. are rarely approached by feminists except in cases where a woman is in some way disadvantaged. Feminism has historically been exclusively for women's rights and its proponents continuously only advocate for women's rights. That's a noble goal and its okay to have a movement like that but to claim that it also approaches men's issues is disingenuous. Men's issues also need approaching and tackling, just as women's issues do. This means there needs to be an egalitarian movement which equally faces both men's and women's issues and replaces feminism, or there needs to be a men's rights movement. 

Regardless of what feminism claims, only issues which affect women are approached. That's okay, but to claim that it's about 'putting men and women on equal footing' is disingenuous. 

> Don't sulk in the corner and start your own movement because you feel like your not getting enough attention

Being condescending and hateful to people trying to approach issues which affect them achieves nothing. If I was to say something similar about feminism, I would be a hateful misogynist so why is it okay for you to say that about men's rights movements? Could it be that such sentiments are sexist?

>try to understand women's struggles and I guarantee you'll start to understand that the root cause of men's rights issues are the same bullshit that disadvantages women. You don't need a separate movement to fix them. 

People tend to understand women's issues better than men's issues. The root causes are only the same when you abstract away too far to be practical. What root cause do you mean? Stereotypes? People are assholes? Any root cause you can find cannot be fixed by focusing exclusively on the impact it has on women. Men face different stereotypes to women and you're not going to be able to fix all of them by fixating on women. 

Feminism's failure to address men's issues require men's rights movements and attention to men's issues. I would recommend reading The Boy Crisis by Warren Farrell, or at least reading the relevant studies around the topic. "
"1. Wikipedia is describing an all-encompassing umbrella of terminology that the term ""rape"" can fall under; I referenced the medical (aka legal) definition of rape specifically because the user I was responding to was gratuitously using the term in a bad faith argument.

>Whether or not he actually did that, I don't know. I don't think Monica Lewinsky has ever claimed that Bill Clinton raped her, or committed anything like rape. 

In 2014, Monica Lewinsky wrote in Vanity Fair that their relationship was between two consenting adults. 

>But a person's authority over another person absolutely can be coercion, and that coercion absolutely can bypass any reasonable understanding of consent.

No reasonable person would argue otherwise. However, as I previously mentioned, I was responding to a particular commenter who was clearly trolling and using deliberately inflammatory language to make a ""point"".

>If a professor threatens to fail a student for not sucking his dick, that would be rape. Obviously the most powerful man on the planet's ability to coerce an intern is much higher than that of a professor coercing a student.

Well, first of all, I'd suggest you make your tone less condescending if you want to reconvert anyone at all. Not everyone will be willing to listen to someone who treats them like they're stupid (even if the person actually was stupid) because emotions can blind people. Me, I'm used to it, so I've ignored it thus far. But as for your question: if you could give me a reasonable explanation to certain things my family, friends, and I have experienced; or if you could demonstrate God for sure does not exist; or maybe show that all religions (or, to simplify it, the religions one is most likely to have heard of nowadays- I know there are thousands of religions and disproving them all would take forever, if we take the disproof to be about some aspect other than the existence of the particular deity) are wrong/illogical in some fundamental aspect other than the ""god(s) exist"" one; then I'd become an atheist. 

Also, honest question: why do people treat Dawkins as the end-all, be-all when it comes to his ideas on theology, if he is a biologist and not a philosopher or theologian? That sounds kind of like taking a historian's ideas on nuclear physics as authoritative. Wrong field, there's definitely people who know more that we can refer to. Not saying it automatically makes Dawkins' ideas wrong- they may be correct. I'm just saying... why do so many people refer to him, rather than to someone who could verify his philosophy is sound or not?"

How is this even a meaningful grouping then? If you weren't implying that Leninists are in the minority, then you were implying that Trots/MLs/MLMs are comparable to liberals and reactionaries because they disagree with the anarchists on the USSR. That's even worse.

How was the USSR not socialist? You're claiming that they don't understand what socialism is, but you haven't explained how they're wrong.

>It's never been about how many people think a certain thing, but what kind of people they are.

Alright, well that's actually even less useful because you've grouped all these ""kinds"" of people together merely because they disagree with you. Liberals and reactionaries may both accept that the USSR was socialist, but they do do for different reasons than Trots/MLs/MLMs do. They don't even agree with each other's reasoning most of the time, and even if they all did have the same reasoning, that wouldn't have any bearing on whether or not Leninists were correct.

"It is implicit within any generalisation that there are going to be some exceptions. This does not mean there is not some truth to such an observation.

>As if we were wondrous beings with our heavy morality, sticking stigmas on everything around us with our mighty superiority.

Human morality is more complex because the human mind is more sophisticated. Whether you consider this to mean human morality is superior depends on how you determine superiority.

>I have to tell you something that'll be really hard for you to hear.

Could you be any more condescending and mistaken?

>Nature is not ethical. 

Yes it is. All animals have their own moral code. This makes them ethical by definition, they simply don't abide by human morality.

>It does not sit on some moral high ground out of supposed compassion.

Depends on what you mean by high moral ground. Other animals lack many of the sinister characteristics that humans have, but they also lack many of our good traits. They are generally simpler and have less complex moral codes.

>With our useless morals, we drive ourselves further from who we are.

How do you claim that morals are useless? Are you nihilistic, because that is an irrational and cowardly position to take. Morals are of fundamental importance and determine the conduct and survival of all living being where cognizance and not purely biology is driving their actions.

>But whatever, take your human morality and feel superior that you have all this wonderful compassion and integrity.

Someone with both compassion and integrity would not likely have a smug attitude, because that's not a compassionate attitude to have.

> Don't get too caught up with the statement they are fundamentally the same on different timescales, one is clearly defined as allele frequency changes within a population and the other is designated at or above species level (something, as yet, un observed.

What happens when genes change over a long enough time? You're getting hung up on this whole ""observation"" thing. Lets say you're coming home from work and the building you live in is just a shell with some burnt wood and ash. Now, just because you didn't observe whatever happened - can you not make a deduction based on the evidence available to you?

Also, this is from the wikipedia link you linked me on Macroevolution, regarding the words misuse by Creationists:

> The term ""macroevolution"" frequently arises within the context of the evolution/creation debate, usually used by creationists alleging a significant difference between the evolutionary changes observed in field and laboratory studies and the larger scale macroevolutionary changes that scientists believe to have taken thousands or millions of years to occur. They accept that evolutionary change is possible within what they call ""kinds"" (""microevolution""), but deny that one ""kind"" can evolve into another (""macroevolution"").[14] Contrary to this belief among the anti-evolution movement proponents, evolution of life forms beyond the species level (i.e. speciation) has indeed been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions and in nature.

And here's the link they include after the word nature: here.

> Microevolution. There's no evidence to suggest macroevolution. You seem to not even be aware of the logical leap you are making here.

There is plenty of evidence to suggest macroevolution, from the fossil layers to the genes themselves."

If you can't figure out how a word having too many meanings and too broad a meaning becomes functionally useless then I don't know what to say. If you etch the same piece of metal with a million different symbols all you will have achieved is effacement; exactly the term I used, intentionally. When a word can mean a dozen things in any context then the word begins to be functionally useless because it is no longer distinct but rather becomes vague and confusing.

You can make a numbered list of every problem with legalization, and I can write an answer for each one, if not several answers, most backed by the precedent set by other legal MORE DANGEROUS recreational drugs.

You can't tell us to make an argument based on facts, but then refuse to read any argument that takes a stance. You can't claim that we have not thought through the details of legalization when there are many easy ways to do it that have already been argued, with precedent from drugs that are legal now. You can't accuse us of using bullshit studies when historically, resistance to legalization has been based on lies.

For Blizzard, it was profitable for Blizzard. Considering a Blizzard representative made that claim, not the people who actually invested money into it. There are some who say the revenue is very high, but no one actually came out and said they are seeing profits right now. And even if that is the case now, the OWL is a marathon not a sprint, and teams are expected to do another huge investment to create a venue for season 3, plus more teams are joining in, so the League has to make even more revenue to account for the increased investment. 

>Baseball then. It's MLB or bust. Peripheral smaller leagues are not important at all to the health of a sport.

Yeah in America, you can still go play baseball in some other country if you don't like the MLB. Though that is a bit harder because it's a less popular sport. And as a counter argument, the most popular sport on the planet has a ton of leagues, and many smaller leagues who keep producing players for the higher teams, so no your argument of saying side leagues or smaller leagues don't matter is pure bullshit.

Mr ""Side leagues are not important for the health of a sport."" says that. Also saying my opinion is better, sounds kinda hilarious to me, how can an opinion be better? It can be more factual correct, but saying it's better is kinda ignorant of what an opinion is, an opinion is subjective not objective, it doesn't have to be completely rooted in fact, but you can use facts to try and sway people towards yours, something that you are not even doing if I may add, you just ask other people to back their own opinions with fact, and then you say those facts are not good, without you yourself even showing any counter arguments backed by some facts.

But neah, they decided to kill all of that instead, they actively destroyed their own e-sports and refocused it entirely around the OWL. 

>This might be your dumbest paragraph so far, which is really saying something.

 http 

Lower than average viewership means literally that less people wanted to watch. This article has facts showing exactly, that the viewership was lower than average. And now it's 300k? WTF, are you trying to tell me that if it wasn't on ESPN the Twitch viewership would have been 300k higher? Does ESPN have no base viewership, people who would watch anything? Also I did not insult you, so I would like it if you could keep it civil around here. 

>The league was profitable for the teams as well

How do you know? The video you keep mentioning did not specify, it's just Nate Nanzer I think, or someone from Blizzard saying the OWL is profitable year one. It did not specify what that means, could it be the OWL itself, if so what is the revenue sharing, could it mean the OWL is profitable for Blizzard? It did not specify. 


>Initial investment is not profit rofl. Do you even understand basic accounting and business practices?

Do you even know how the OWL got founded? 12 teams paid 5 million dollars to Blizzard, from that cash Blizzard made the OWL and also invested some of their own. So if I give you 20 dollars and I tell you to go pick up something worth 25, and you put 5 dollars of your own and then you sell it for 40 to someone else, and we split it evenly, did you make a profit? But did I make a profit? 

>They objectively did not overpay. The market determined that value and that's what twitch paid, as well as the sponsors

How did the market do that? The OWL started this year and Twitch paid 90 million before they knew what kind of viewership the OWL would have. No other game is getting that kind of cash from Twitch, absolutely nobody, not League despite having overall more viewers on the platform, not CSGO which posts record breaking numbers during big events and not Fortnite. 

>If that was an overpay, then they wouldn't be adding new sponsors and streaming options during the season

I said Twitch overpaid, we do not know what those other sponsors are paying or for how long their contracts are. We know that about twitch though. 

>You have no idea how markets and businesses work

And you seem to have no people skills, considering how you just seem to insult people who disagree with you for no reason, and act in a condescending manner as if you are far above them. 


>And it is. Glad we agree the league is doing just fine

It isn't though, the viewership is below other esports.

>Because people like me who watch every OWL game aren't going to watch streamers in the downtime. And 20-30k (if thats the actual number since you've shown a complete inability to consider all factors) is just fine.

But if the game is doing so well, and has so many players and lots of other people who are not watching OWL, then it should have lots of people watching streamers, considering it's what happens when a game is popular.

>He would have to be balanced around a situation where he was against a heavy AP opponent and got full stacks. The rest of his kit would have to be held below par to make up for the snowbally nature of his kit.

His kit shouldn't be balanced around max stacks versus a heavy AP opponent - that's best case scenario. His kit should be balanced around inbetween best and worst case scenario, so he can be viable vs. AD enemies but obviously less powerful, and a huge, powerful counter vs. AP enemies. 

If all champions were balanced around their best case scenario, they'd all be significantly weaker. Katarina isn't balanced around a scenario where all of her enemies are squishy and have little to no crowd control and can't poke her out of an engagement. She's balanced around a scenario where the enemy team will likely have tanks and crowd control and poke.

>Or being forced to suicide because your stacks were all based on AD opponents and they don't replace the oldest stack.

You're never forced to commit suicide, you just have to play with a bit of a disadvantage that you set yourself up for when you made bad targeting decisions and focused down enemies that leave you at said disadvantage in the first place. Sometimes it's better to let kills go if they'll put you at a worse position later on, and that goes for every kill any champion could get. 

>Or how it encourages really bad gameplay and decisions like choosing tokill a weak AP opponent because of the passive instead of the 10/0 adc.

And it encourages good decision making and target choice - do I want to get more AP and get myself further ahead even though I'll be able to beat this AP guy later on since I counter him even without stacks or do I want to help out my team and kill this fed AD carry if I can get the chance?"
">And, hey, while we're in the business of condemning things, it's important to remember that massive British state violence was dealt out in Northern Ireland. Jeremy just condemned this. Do others? Do they even get asked? 

Thank you.

Everyone on here is seemingly very quick to condemn one side of the story, and even if it isn't intended, it can can come across as very, very condescending and patronizing as if people in Northern Ireland need to be taught their own history.

My Uncle once described how in the days immediately after Bloody Sunday, otherwise honest and decent young men, were practically lining up in the streets in order to enter into the IRA to get revenge for the atrocity. It was one of its greatest recruitment tools, and sadly I often imagine drone strikes and similar things in the present day Middle East contribute to a similar situation and make everyone less safe. 

People often forget how badly the British fucked up here and perpetuated the cycle of violence. At first the British Army was welcomed as protectors of the Catholic Communities which felt under attack from Protestants who controlled the levers of power and denied thousands equality in a Northern Irish State that had institutionalized sectarianism at its core:


>At first the Catholic minority welcomed the soldiers joyfully, believing them to be neutral.

>But the honeymoon did not last long. It soon became apparent that the military was there to defend the status quo, and to do so by all means necessary. Today it is known that the military's intelligence service employed agents who were involved in murders, weapons smuggling and bombings with the help of their leadership. It is one of the darkest chapters in the history of the British military.

>Under these circumstances, fresh recruits flocked to the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which was little more than a veteran's association at the end of the 1960s. 


The Troubles was messy, complicated and there were many, many wrongs and very few rights, but to make out as if the IRA just sprang out of nowhere to kill and maim indiscriminately is a false reading of history. Sadly violence, begets violence and everyone ends up losing, but to keep touting this mantra of 'Corbyn and the IRA' whilst ignoring the actions of the Police B Specials, the British Army and Unionist Governments of the time is very offensive IMO"

No. Absolutely not. I will not buy into such arrogant and condescending elitism - despite the fact that, according to most criteria, people like you would consider me on the ""plus"" side of any such quality scale. It is thinking like yours which justifies all sorts of cruelty and injustice in this world. I simply will not accept it. All people are people and deserve to be treated as such. Noone is of lower quality than anyone else. People may have different skills and talents and abilities (I'm sure there are things you are bad at), but those differences do not lead to anyone being higher or lower quality than anyone else.

>There's probably more to suggest that she wanted to quit and didn't mind leaving in the place of Heidi given that we were shown that she was contemplating quitting and also given Christy's voting confessional: [...] Either because she didn't mind leaving at that point or because she just wants to extend a friendly gesture to her ally.

Also a valid interpretation, I disagree with it though

>I think the idea that mastermind Jenna has calculated Rob in such a way that she can accurately peg the percentages that he is likely to do x and y after he successfully blindsided her during the previous round is hilarious.

Seems needlessly condescending, he openly wanted to keep her around so he's not super likely to vote for her it's really as simple as that and I don't see how it's this big convoluted thing she could have possibly have thought of and you are really really overstating the importance of more or less irrelevant percentages I gave as a way of generally saying that while he was probably voting with her regardless this locked it up

>I like Jenna a lot in the way I like Fabio her win is absolutely hilarious but still valid (unlike Ben).

">Either stay out of competitive until you consider yourself decent enough at multiple heroes, or communicate with your Pharah so that she makes it her number 1 priority to deal with the Bastion. 

Ok, so since you haven't been in competitive mode or read my post apparently, two flaws:

1) Asking your team mates to do something, in 99% of cases, doesn't do anything. Best case scenario, they say nothing and continue doing what they're doing.

2) I am good at multiple heroes, though I generally play tank or support.

>Bastion is not an invincible juggernaught against anyone not named Pharah, Genji, Widow, or Hanzo

No, but the other heroes have a much harder time of taking him out and bastion is a hero who does not tolerate mistakes.

>In fact most if not all of the offensive heroes have a relatively simple time taking him out.

Ok, let's examine that statement, shall we?

Soldier 76: Can do it, but is far more likely to force the Bastion to reposition, rather than take him out, if the Bastion knows what he's doing.

Reaper: On a lot of maps, Reaper will have a hard time getting close. I'm talking about things like the last point in London. He's going to require multiple teleports to get into effective range.

Tracer: Actually, probably has the easiest time out of the 4 that aren't counters, since she can be tricky to hit.

McCree: without his flash bang, he's got the same problem as Soldier - He probably won't kill, but can force him to reposition.

>The beauty of an fps with so many heroes is that the counters and matchups are more akin to a fluid than a rigid chart. 

Sorry, but didn't you say 

>Unfortunately one of the main causes of the disease you mentioned is a relatively slim pool of heroes, it's not slash and burn, it's a band-aid.

Please keep your story straight, but I get the point that heroes can kill him, but doing it effectively is required and few can do that without coordination.

>Maybe I'm projecting or being a dick 

Well, yes.

>I apologize

Apology accepted.

>in nearly every strongly competitive multiplayer game (assuming you're in solo-queue where you won't always get your role), you need to be at a competent level for nearly every position. Even in the case of 1-hero type per team you can usually get away with maining 2 or 3 roles.

Or you could just have it so you aren't restricted, as has been one of Overwatch's biggest strengths since it's beta?

And here's the flaw in your idea: You don't play ""roles"" in Overwatch. Aside from Reinhardt, there is no true ""tank"" but there are heroes who swap dps for survivability and supporting abilities. There are true supports, but aside from that, there are only heroes who do varying amounts of damage, in various ways. This is not league of legends and the same logic applied to LoL cannot be applied to it.

>To become a well rounded player, you can have a core of 6 or 7 heroes, but they need to be spread out enough to cover multiple situations. If learning these different positions doesn't sound fun, or you don't want to put in the work then perhaps competitive mode just isn't for you? 

Alright, I know you apologised for this shit earlier, but consider that apology insufficient.

You appear to have misunderstood what I said, willfully as I don't beleive you're stupid enough to genuinely misunderstand.

My point is that I shouldn’t have to use multiple outside resources to teach myself the concepts to succeed on house exams. At the very least I should be able to get a 70 from just looking at lecture materials a couple times. And I can when the professor is good. The problem arises when you have professors who struggle to explain basic concepts. You can either spend 2 hours trying to decipher what the fuck they are talking about or watch a 14 minute video where a qualified lecturer explains it in much clearer terms,

> If you're P/F, it doesn't matter. Relative ranking matters. In either case, I doubt any school wants to fail more than 1-3% of any given class. So it would be curved regardless.

Well I’m letter graded and ranked, I’m pretty sure there are like no true P/F DO schools. And you would think they wouldn’t want to fail 1-3% but the class above us lost around 40 people out of a class of 240 due to academics and my class has lost 13 people since M2 started. My school does not curve exams either, not even to round up percentage points.

> Question, what year are you? Because if you're a M1 or M2, you have no idea what's high yield. You only know what's on board review material. Which isn't all, ""high yield."" Correlation with Uworld, sure, but i doubt an M1 or M2 at this point in the calendar year is using uworld, which are the gold standard board style questions.

M2, and by “high yield” I mean most commonly tested concepts on board exams, as what would be found in First Aid. You can’t know what is on the exam due to the changing nature of licensing exams but you can safely say that if it is in board review material, it will likely be on boards in some form. 

> Yeah no, DO students are objectively worse test takers. MCAT, GPA, STEP, you name it. On average, DO students are poorer test takers.

The MCAT is hardly comparable to any med school material except for maybe the biochem section. In fact, the only section that has any substantial correlation between board performance and MCAT sub section score is biochem which, on average DO students usually match MD students in terms of score.

Undergrad GPA can be gamed, either by going to a grade inflating undergrad or having an easy major or dropping courses you struggle with or taking notoriously easier professors. You know this as well as I do. If you’re in med school or a doctor then we both have played this game at some point.

Either way my argument is that at least at my school the underperforming on boards is due to professors not teaching to prepare us for boards. which they routinely and openly avoid doing so.

> I very much doubt this. Accrediting bodies watch grad rates closely. It spells trouble for schools when they fail a certain amount of students. That said, think through the logic. Supposedly, you're making a few extra K. Why not just boost a few rota sites with preceptor sites and add more slots instead? Additionally, there's an issue with your school's rank if you're seen as producing students who routinely fail their boards. It's self-defeating.

From speaking to people who have repeated or personally know people who have been dismissed or dropped out they routinely do things to mask this. Like the assistant dean emailing at risk students and “encouraging” them to drop out rather than be dismissed because it looks better on your record. they also routinely have people from previous years drop down a year to repeat rather than dismiss them. Just in my M2 class alone we have ~20 people repeating from the previous year.

"> There are more than a few, and they have different names now, like the ""Alt-Right"" and ""White Nationalists.""

Yeah, and most normal people aren't besties with them. You can oppose the modern social justice movement without being a nazi, and indeed, most people who do aren't nazis.

>Sorry, I don't buy that, and unless you have actual data that supports your claim I'm going to have to call BS. Now, some of these anti-feminists may claim they are for equal rights, but they'll be just as quick to dismiss any actual examples of sexism.

You're the one accusing millions of people who disagree with feminism of being bigots, so the burden of proof is on you to show that they are bigoted. Obviously GamerGate doesn't represent all anti-SJWs and it isn't necessarily an anti-feminist movement, as many are big fans of moderate feminists like Liana Kerzner, but GamerGate is a prime example of people who oppose the modern social justice movement AND support equality. There is also a ton of data on this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Just a minute ago you were saying that it's about representation with your ""encouraging video games to provide more than the usual white male power fantasy"" comment. Yet now you're saying that games you don't like are inherently harmful to society and are using that as a justification for your views. That sure seems like moving the goalpoasts and like you deliberately downplayed your true beliefs regarding feminism in gaming. It's not about ""encouraging games to provide more than the usual white male power fantasy,"" it's about stopping things you don't like from existing. It's almost as if the first is just a meaningless PR statement to put a rosy cover on your true intentions.

>No, I don't. There are such a thing as minimum standards of quality and decency. They don't have to be very high.

>But, yeah, there are some minimum standards that publishers abide by, and for good reason.

No, games aren't required to have a minimum standard of anything. You personally, as a consumer, may have minimum standards of what you expect in a game, but that shouldn't be forced on others. In fact, having minimum standards when it comes to what products you buy is generally a positive thing, as it helps ensure that functional products will continue to be made, whereas broken or useless products will fall to the wayside.

However, when it becomes a problem is when you want to force your standards on everyone else. And to make matters even worse, you wish to force your political desires on everyone else. It's not about delivering a functioning product, a good story or groundbreaking gameplay, to you it's about making sure that your clique's ideology is represented and that anyone who doesn't agree with your ideology is destroyed.

>Are we talking about art, or video games? Because the latter are not necessarily art - and I say this as a professional game developer.

Oh gatekeeper, please tell me more about how video games aren't art.

>Sorry, but no. Publishers have a responsibility to the public, and to their shareholders. Putting out a game where you're a KKK guy lynching blacks would immediately make the publisher fair game for a boycott, and perhaps a lawsuit under hate speech laws (where appropriate).

To their shareholders, yes. To the ""public"" (read: your clique), no. Nobody is under any onligation to peddle any ideology, whether it's feminism or conservatism or nazism or liberalism or anything else. Game developers have one job, to make a good game.

If you don't want to spend your money on a game where you play as the KKK and lynch blacks, it's your right as a consumer to boycott it, but it still has a right to exist. Also, I see you have gone for the most extreme example possible to poison the well, even though no such games are being made and will probably ever be made by AAA studios; and even if one were made, it certainly wouldn't be successful.

During the last 30 years, we have been suckered 3 times:

1. When we voted “Non” in 1980.

1. When we voted for Bryan “on the grab” Mulroney in 1984.

1. When we voted NDP this year.

All three times have seen Ottawa grabbing more power to marginalize Québec even more. We have had our lesson. Now that Canada doesn’t have to give a shit about us, the inevitable result will be a resurgence of sovereignism.

> The Bloc is a party that represents only Quebec's sovereigntist interest at the Federal level - the fact that they got destroyed as utterly as they did shows that Quebec is willing to put those interests aside. That's the point I was making.

And the NDP will amply demonstrate that they will not stand for Québec’s best interests if it goes against the interests of some other province. Mark my words.

> 2) That may be true, but the vast majority of the political rhetoric I've seen from Quebeckers in recent months has been anti-PLQ as opposed to anti-Harper. 

Here is a bit of political adjustement: the Québec “liberal” party is liberal in name only. There hasn’t been a conservative party in Québec for more than 75 years, and that void was somewhat filled-up by Duplessis’s Union Nationale. But once the Union Nationale got decimated in the 1970’s and the Parti-Québécois came to power, both parties have drifted rightwards, and the liberals replaced the tory/conservatives of 50 years before, and the Parti-Québécois eventually got to occupy the position the liberals had until the mid 1970’s/early 1980’s.

So, while the Canadian Reform Alliance Party isn’t exactly a bunch of tories, they are pretty close nevertheles to Charests’ liberals.

"I don't care about vanilla and I don't care about what special items were. I'm speaking strictly about Rebirth. Edmund HIMSELF, in his blod edmundm.com, has said that the SPECIAL pool in rebirth would be more of an 'OP item' pool, to prevent getting OP combos all the time. Every item is OP for its own reason, but they're all still OP items.

Out of the SPECIAL item list, there are only 3 items that I would take out of the 'potentially OP' category:

>Ludo, DR Fetus, Soy Milk

Edmund didn't make Soy Milk special because he thought the other special items wouldn't fit with soy milk. What the hell is that. Pyro, d6, d100, stopwatch, and pyromaniac, all are unrelated to Soy Milk. So why would you hurt the chance of finding them? Other items are simply not bad, but not great with Soy, like Poly and Quad Shot... Soy Milk and Fetus are simply a case of edmund overstimating an item, and nothing else. D6 was made SPECIAL just so it wasn't an instant special finder. Ludo was made special so you didn't get Ludo+Brim every single item.

However, let's look at the special pool once again. THESE are items that are POTENTIALLY good, and as such were made SPECIAL:

>d100, Ludovico Technique, Polyphemus, Pyromaniac

Now, these are items that are ridiculously good alone, and as such were made SPECIAL:

>Knife, Brimstone, Quad shot, Epic fetus, Sacred Heart, Stopwatch, Godhead

Now obviously some of these have good synergies, but when you look at ANY of the items listed, would you think ""Hmm I could pick this up but then I'd have to hope for X""? Not at all. They're good and as such you pick them up as soon as possible regardless of whatever you have, because they're upgrades, and they're overpowered.

Now, let's look at some items that were made SPECIAL simply because why the fuck not:

>Soy Milk, Fetus


Speaking strictly about numbers, I'd just say Edmund overstimated those 2 items, and that's it. Sorry about sounding agressive by the way, but when you say things such as 

>Did you know that the term ""special item"" was invented by the BoI community?

>It is readily evident to any reasonable observer that humans regularly engage in activities that are deemed pleasurable in the near term but which inevitably lead to great and ""unwanted"" drama later on. 

Sure, but as a general rule people don't sleep with their roommates who may then cause financial and romantic problems in the future. Maybe I should point out that those most adamantly against cohabitation and so called sexual temptation frequently are caught in extramarital affairs. Would that mean it's a bad idea to hold your beliefs and be married?

>That quite frequently includes ill-advised sexual liaisons. Frankly this is not even debatable and it is nigh on incredibly that you would insist that some universal desire to avoid ""drama"" somehow negates this readily evident truth.
 
It clearly is debatable, I and others in the thread are debating it. The only thing that's evident is your preconceived ideas of young people and sex. Do we have lots of hot, nasty, awesome sex? Some. Is it with roommates we see at their worst looking like refried shit and needing a shower after work while stuffing their face with junk food and bitching about petty issues? Not really, no. I don't think you understand what roommates are to each other, like, at all.

>My argument was never that it was not possible to cohabitate without sex, but that it is ill-advisable 

If you're argument is not that the majority of those cohabiting will end up fucking and just that it could happen, I've got some bad news. If people want to fuck they're gonna fuck. It's now become a bad idea to be around anyone, anywhere. I recall some pretty great sex in the library, in the office, in a parking lot, on the hood of my car, on the roof of the school, in the middle of the school gymnasium, in the park, in the restroom, in a taxi, in an elevator....you get the idea. Yet never with a roommate. Huh. 

You're preventing nothing by demanding people not live together, so what's the point? Again, those people are generally unattractive regardless of looks, simply because of the lack of mystery and suspense. Look what happens to married couples, they lose that spark. Same reasons apply.

>particularly so with young people.

Oh yes, because sexual promiscuity and sky-rocketing STI rates are a problem for ""young people"", not those over 50? May want to fact check just a bit there, you are in for a surprise.

>Actually, I'm basing it on an observation of human sexual behavior which is often opportunistic

O.o Dude. Gross. Don't watch young people having sex, that's creepy.

>alongside the admission that those involved in the original question are young adults

Age is irrelevant after reaching adulthood. Again, see reports on sexuality in the elderly. You're still working on the assumption that they are attracted to each other, which isn't usually the case. Don't take my word for it, go do a survey at the college. Ask if they're slippin it to the roommate. Oh, that's right...anyone who says they aren't is lying. Convenient.

>coupled with the admonition of the apostle Paul to walk in wisdom with respect to our sexuality (II Timothy 2:22).

Good ol' Paul, no repression evident there. 

You know what's wise? Not playing hide the pickle with roommates. That's why most people don't do it.

I just have to agree with the critics, that when you start to have to plug all those holes yourself, you start to lose faith in the story and the director - then you notice them making poor decisions for timing, or editing, or George Lucas-esque ""ooh look, it's poetic symmmetry"" gaffs, and it all just falls apart.

Until he was able to better himself (which included creating jobs for himself) he applied at more than dozens of places, perhaps in the hundreds.

 the elderly
 people who have been downsized, fired, or otherwise had other opportunities close.

The only reason we end up having to use ""government"" to fix a problem is because the system is flawed by design, but I'd suggest that when someone has a minimum wage that is significantly below actual costs of living while the ""government"" is giving out corporate welfare in the terms of insane tax policy, military contracts, you name it, that it might be in everyone's best interests to fix the inequity so you don't have someone ""work"" at Walmart and still need to subsidize their existence because Walmart can't run a business except in its very broken business model depending on that very government to operate the way it does.

"> Yes, educate people and create a greater social morality. Your points are nice, but they avoid the simple need for accountability among the people, particularly men of India.

Your point tacitly assumes that men of India don't know that rape is wrong or don't have accountability. But the truth is the criminals of India don't have accountability. Claiming with a condescending attitude that men of India need to learn accountability is not going to help anyone. It is also easy to say that ""educate people and create social morality"". But the criminals who are committing rapes are not committing rapes because they don't know that rapes are a crime. How would you feel if someone says that you need to be educated in social morality because a criminal in your city raped someone. 

> The critics need not tone down anything. Face the problem and deal with it head on. It is the only way. It's not up to reaction groups to fix a mentality in the people. It is not up to anyone else but the Indian men who do this.

There is an absolute need to tone down the criticism to levels corresponding to reality. Instead of calling India ""Land of rape"" why not highlight the social inequality that results in higher crime rates and how the lack of resources for law enforcement ends up with poor enforcement. And why limit the responsibility to Indian men? Why draw that arbitrary line? Don't we all have a responsibility as citizens of the world? People in India also draw such arbitrary lines and claim that the problems are in a different State and it is that State's responsibility. Or do you just want to be a critic on the sidelines.

> Anything less is flimsy excuses and pardoning of what amounts to unacceptable behaviours and mindsets. If one cannot accept they are wrong, that is the first part of the problem. If one thinks the problem will be solved by external methods, they are simply wrong for the most part.

That's your biggest mistake. No one in India is pardoning unacceptable behaviors. Just because our under resourced law enforcement is not able to keep up the prosecution doesn't mean we are pardoning of rapes. It just highlights that problems that we have as a developing nation with limited resources.

It might be bad striking but it is good (effective) MMA in the current meta. And this is your problem. Throughout your posts, you only see the striking techniques in isolation.

Your original analysis of what is happening is correct, you just can't see why it is happening.

We have seen fighters dominating MMA with superior striking years ago, and we have moved on since then. It is not like everyone suddenly started ignoring their striking game; the game itself has shifted.

> I believe in holding the sport to a higher standards, especially when you look at how fast fighters are improving across the board.

That is quite the condescending statement. The golden standard of the sport is: ""win"". This is what is driving the evolution of MMA. No matter what your opponent does, find a way to overcome it and win the fight. Purist attitudes have been proved wrong time and again. In case you missed it, striking has evolved just as grappling has evolved. Differentiation from pure boxing or muay thai technique doesn't make it of ""lower standards"", nor does it devalue the pure styles themselves the slightest. It is just evolution."

Obviously you defer to the person or culture that has been victimized in such a situation. Black women have been told for centuries how they have to wear their hair. Black women even today get fired for wearing their natural hair or get criticized for it. So of course when a style of hair that comes from black culture is popularized, you can bet that person is going to feel like her culture and that she herself were mistreated. She is 100% right in getting to say whatever she wants and voice her frustrations at the people who have benefitted off of the exploration of her culture.

> You're cherry picking slavery because it's an easy win. Of course slavery is abhorrent. Who would argue otherwise? 

That's the point. Slavery is a clear example of where no one is going to suggest that we compromise between those who want slavery and those who think everyone should be free. Issues of oppression in the modern era are the exact same. There is no room for compromise. There is a clear and fundamental moral side of the argument here. Black oppression in the modern area is wrong and compromising on such oppression is just as wrong as compromising on slavery.

That these people are unable to take a horrible experience and use it to create some positivity, to grow, to move past it and come to a place of healing and joy and true, infinite love?

Where did I say everyone? Where do you keep getting ""everyone""? I go out of my way over and over to say it's not everyone and it's pretty arrogant and smug for you to keep pretending I said something else. 

And saying economic or national misfortune puts populations at risk for populism isn't arrogant smugness. It's not condescending to say that at the 30,000 ft level that's a risk factor. That's well known. 

As for the individuals, again you deliberately ignored what I said: anyone who falls for populism is not a vulnerable victim, they're an asshole. People who join Britain First so they can ride around immigrant neighborhoods in range rovers while wearing matching jackets are assholes. 

Finally, you make clear where our disagreement lies: you think ""a small percentage"" of people joining extreme groups doesn't matter. How much doesn't matter? Where does it start to matter? Does it matter if 5% of a country joins a Golden Dawn style party? 10%? What proportion of the GOP or even just Trump supporters need to become overtly nasty before it's a problem?

The bottom line is I think the right has an extremist problem. You think it doesn't rise to the level of a problem. That's a fair disagreement."

"> It's only true if you accept all your axioms, one of which is, apparently, ""all violence is always wrong in every circumstance.""

You've created a straw man here and proceeded to tear it down vigorously. How many Anarchistic Libertarians do you know? There's a reason why we are almost always the best armed people around, and we are mostly just fine with violence, assuming that it is being used for defense. It's aggression that we find axiomatically, moralistically deplorable, specifically, the initiation of force. And you do too: 

> Violence can be justified, at both and individual and societal level, in order to prevent further violence or other, worse harms.

...or you would not feel the need to couch your defense of violence in the prevention of or defense against harm.

> I do agree that libertarian philosophy generally uses about a kindergarten-level of discourse in defining things like ""force"" and ""coercion"", so no disagreement there.

Calling libertarian philosophy childish is yet another means to avoid having to deal directly with the ideas that you are ""arguing"" against. When I say that ""don't hit, use your words"" is kindergarten level stuff, I am referring to the moral justification of the non-aggression principle, not to the much broader discussion of libertarian philosophy which is only partially predicated upon that principle. The questions of whether or not the State is inherently aggressive, whether free exchange yields better results for more people than regulated exchange, if commodity currency is more or less stable than fiat, if rights are inhered or inherited, etc., etc. are all questions that don't really involve the NAP.

> In both cases ""give me money or I'll shoot you"" vs. ""work for x wage or go poor"", the exchange is free (both parties still technically have a choice)

Equating these two situations as both being free exchanges is about the stupidest thing I have ever heard. It is the same as saying that Slavery is a free exchange because you always have the option of being lynched. Therefore slaves are free. Arguing this point as a first principle is nothing short of moronic. 

> Conversely, how do you protect property or even have the concept of property without either violence or the threat of violence?

Ignoring for a moment that the NAP is about aggression and not violence, are you honestly saying that you, personally, would simply rob your neighbor without the threat of violence holding you back? You would rape or enslave others without being under constant threat of violence? Almost all humans in the Western world treat other individuals as sovereign. All that 'property' is, is a representation of personal effort. You work to build something, sometimes for yourself, sometimes for others in exchange for their money or time or chocolate chips or aardvark hot sauce that they have, and then you have something, it is a reflection of yourself, your labor, your time. No one in the world has a better moral claim to your possessions than you do, and with the exception of a small, sociopathic percentage of the population, we almost all respect that. What stops us from taking the property of others is not some violent externality, but a basic moral compass - we respect others because we do, and overwhelmingly, they respect us. When they do not, it is an exception, not the general rule, and as such can be dealt with using mostly non-violent means.

> Whereby ""moral relativism""= morals I disagree with.

Okay... nope. Moral relativism is the assertion that morality differs based upon circumstance or opinion, which is precisely what 

> You view taxation as slavery, I view wage labour as slavery. You can't claim one is objectively ""right"" or ""the truth"" while the other is wrong.

...says. It attempts to justify the misapprehension that getting paid for a job is the same as being a slave by saying that it's just differing viewpoints. It isn't. The slave isn't free, and a job isn't slavery. 

> congratulations on finding an ideology where you're automatically right because anyone who disagrees with you is a 'coward', a 'moral relativist' and 'wrong'.

 http 

>. It was one of the main reasons why I didn't like him from the get go because it's a tactic I've seen many a times on here and with others. The idea of saying it's about class diminishes the fact that it's about race.

To get back to your unwarranted condescension... I would've been more accepting of it if you atleast knew what you were talking about. You dont demonstrate any kind of significant understanding of the Sanders' platform, and it seems like all of your arguments are just rehashed from other people giving their misguided views on Sanders. 

Anyway defending Sanders was not my goal when I made my original point. What my post, in hindsight, failed to get at is that Sanders definitely isn't perfect on race issues, but compared to the field of candidates who I would ever consider voting for, he is far away the best candidate when it comes to race issues. So I can criticize Sanders till the cows come home, but that isn't going to make Clinton any better on race issues. Because I have already seen what Clinton will do in order to win. I know it was 8 years ago, but I remember the 08 democratic primary. I remember how she helped push the birther narrative, how she tried to peg Obama as the angry black man, how she said he couldn't get shit done, how she released that photo of Obama in traditional African clothing to try and question his nationality. I have seen, first hand, that Hillary has no problem shitting on black people and on the very black president she tries to hide behind today. So I know for a fact that everything Clinton has to say about our community is a bunch of bullshit. I cant say the same for Sanders. Bottom line: When I see Hillary, I see someone who wants to win because they are driven by ambition and the prospects of power. When I see Sanders, I see someone who has strong convictions who is running to see those convictions realized. Luckily for Sanders, I happen to share a lot of those same convictions, which is why I will be voting for him. "

Freedom of association trumps the bylaws in any lawsuit. The dnc can expressly favor one nominee over another of they believe it to be in the interest of the party.
You can be fired for violating party rules however, which is kind of what happened :/

No.. First off, a ""smoking gun"" isnt a legal term, so it is interesting that your entire argument is based on the idea that there can't be a ""smoking gun"" because legal!


Here are the relevant facts.

The leadership of the DNC had a duty, due to their position as DNC employees, to ensure that the primary election was fair and equitable. That was their job, period. This email shows they clearly conspired to rig the primary in favor of Hillary Clinton. 

The DNC isnt privately owned by Hillary Clinton or Debbie Wasserman Schultz or Barrack Obama. 

The DNC and its employees made numerous false statements to donors and votors claiming that they were acting as the fair and impartial arbitrators of the elections.

The DNC and its employees collected tens of millions of dollars from individuals and corporations.

Now, please explain which ""smoking gun"" you claim can never exist here legally. Are you talking about a civil claim, criminal, who are the parties, etc?

>One of many helpful legal precedents below. [Keep in mind no legal precedent has to be exact, and rarely are since every situation is a bit different (obviously). If you think this does not apply, paste a citation that makes a better argument for your position, don;t just say it does not apply because ""XYZ"" That's how legal arguments work in the court. The judge will side with this precedent unless you find a better one and distinguish it.]
Again, in LaRouche v. Fowler, 152 F.3d 974 (D.C. Cir. 1998), the court ruled that the DNC could enforce a DNC delegate selection rule depriving a presidential candidate of any delegates based on a determination that he was not a bona fide Democrat, even though the candidate had won enough votes in the primaries to be allocated delegates. The court concluded that even if the DNC were to be treated as a state actor, the DNC would not be subject to the “compelling state interest” test because of “the presence of First Amendment interests on both sides of the equation.” 152 F. 3d at 995.
The court held that the Constitution would be “’satisfied if [the party’s rules] rationally advance some legitimate interest of the party in winning elections or otherwise achieving its political goals.’” Id. at 995, quoting Ripon Society, supra, 525 F.21d at 586-87.

What is this? Here you are citing court cases which you claim to show that ""there is no evidence like this that equates to a smoking gun legally"" when you have not even explained what laws you are talking about!

This whole passage seems like a Clinton lackey copypasta. , especially the first paragraph in which you attempt to present yourself as the legal ""expert"" by giving condescending advice about how legal arguments work. 

And then, without taking your own advice, you throw out one court case where a candidate sued the DNC months after an election was over because the handful of delegates he obtained were not seated at the convention.

I guess you think nobody should be upset about the DNC rigging their primary so their boss Obama's chosen successor gets the nomination because of some random court case 20 years ago in which the DNC happened to be the defendant?

My original statement which you responded to was:

Yes, all of GC is a hate group. You can see from the way they claim to know why trans people transition better than actual trans people, that we're somehow involved with Russia, that we're socially regressive, fetishists, disappointments, make fun of our pronouns, that we're a social contagion, and an endless host of other transphobic beliefs. That's without even getting into the various ways GC treats trans people and what GC thinks should be done about trans people.

Now, if you want to actually explain why trans people are sexist, go ahead.

The problem is that GC does not consider anything better than abusive speech to be debate. If GC cannot insult trans people, they simply don't want to take part.

Yes there is, OP commentor (and you too) seem to be falsely equating one crime to another. Statutory Rape to Rape. The two crimes are not synonyms. 

 > So you're basically saying you think it's a lesser crime because she was a willing participant at 15.

No I'm saying it's a different crime, and the law agrees with me. It's not Rape, it's Statutory Rape. Consent, by definition, makes it not rape. 

Furthermore. The idea that:

> below a certain age, a person cannot consent

Is so paternalistic and condescending, it defies words. So is it a crime for 2 15 year olds to fuck each other? They're below the age of consent, by your logic they must be raping each other.


> Legally, she doesn't have the agency you want to attribute. Why you feel so strongly about that in the first place is open to interpretation.

I'm not advocating kiddie fucking, I'm advocating precise language. Exaggerating a cops crime only diminishes those who critique the cop, not the cop. He did not rape her, he statutorily raped her. To say that the title should read ""Cop Rapes Kid"" is dishonest, because it implies Rape, capital R, aka sex without consent, which is a much more emotionally charged story than what really happened. 

It feels good to get angry and say fuck the police, but lying about their already heinous crimes, that won't get anyone anywhere. They do enough foul shit, document them honestly for that. 

> Your characterization of rape is off, too. Rape absolutely can be a violent crime, but that isn't a requirement. A person who says ""No"" but doesn't physically resist is just as much a victim as one who struggles. You completely ignore coercion, as well. Sleep with me or you lose your job. Sleep with me or I'll accuse you of rape. Sleep with me or go to jail...

Yeah no shit sherlock. Rape occurs when there isn't consent. All the reporting is saying the sex was consensual.

So it wasn't rape.

She was on a dating app, soliciting johns. Having consensual sex. The cop had sex with her, then robbed her. That's fucked up enough. By the laws of the US it was statutory rape. That part is also true. To be fair, he probably didn't know she was underage. Most people don't ask to see a hookers photo ID with birth date. 

Characterizing it as Rape, as OP commentor suggests we ought to, takes away her agency as a woman to make choices on whether or not to engage in sex work, it takes away her agency in what she was doing, and miss-characterizes an already shitty crime as something it wasn't. So lets not do that. Lets not lie and exaggerate and engage in hyperbole, lets just speak precisely about what the crime was.

I don't understand why you and everyone upvoting you take this for granted.

You can flush a lot of cocaine or heroin down the toilet or put a lot down the sink. If the police want to put away someone they strongly suspect runs a violent drug organization, a no-knock raid may be the only way. The most important people in an organization are rarely near the drugs very often, so the police can't let an opportunity to catch them red-handed escape.

Of course, you may just prefer that it be as easy as possible to flout drug laws, and I certainly respect this - I'd like to have a joint once in a while without being anxious. Still, drugs and violence often go hand in hand, and I'd like no-knock raids to remain in the police's toolkit for putting away drug dealers with a history of violence.

The perspective angle is completely ludicrous. How does perspective make 18 rows of windows appear bowed in the same manner as the roofline? How does perspective make the bottom row of windows partially vanish behind the building in the foreground?

The sounds pretty condescending to me! But yeah, sure.

> Don't tell them that it is OK for minorities to be racist to them because they have privilege.

I am pretty sure I never said that, nor did I even imply it. Can you quote back to me where I implied that? Maybe I did just miss it.

> Don't tell them that they are an asshole for not acknowledging privilege the very first time they hear of it.

I certainly never used the term 'asshole,' and I'm really unsure as to where you infer any such thing. Again, can you point it out to me?

> Don't tell them that their life is easy. You have no idea what their life is like.

Look, I admitted that right up front. See my very first post, wherein I wrote

> Yeah, white folks can have a hard life. Yeah, being disabled is another disadvantage, and folks can be treated or prejudiced unfairly for it; it's called 'abelism.'

So yeah. I agree.

> Don't insist that they are the only ones with privilege in the world. You aren't in their shoes.

I didn't say that, did I? I was just saying that generally, in American society, whites are the most/more privileged race (see: income by race in America, incarceration rates by race in America, etc.), males are more privileged than women (see: male-female income disparity in America), and straight cis-genered folks have it easier than gay/transgendered (see: don't ask don't tell, 'fag' as a pejorative, etc.).

> Telling somebody that they are an evil oppressor is probably going to piss them off a little when they try to be a good person.

Once again you seem to be putting words in my mouth. When was this ever implied?

> From the sound of it, you may be bouncing off your own privilege.

I do not understand what you mean by that. I'm not trying to be facetious or a jerk or anything, I just honestly don't understand what that is supposed to mean.

Again and finally, I really do fail to see where the insults actually are, and you have failed to point them out. My intention is not to be insulting. What really urged me to even post (against the general ""don't argue on the internet"" maxim) was that from where I was standing, it seemed like you saw a post about someone relating how it can be difficult to get individuals to become aware of privilege (and how to get them to empathize with those whose experiences are not like their own), and came in complaining about how they are failing to understand the troubles of being white.

In subsequent posts it seems to be the case that you are generally aware, but again, to make my perspective as clear as possible, it looked to me like you were missing the point entirely, which can get tiring.

(Also: you seem to be assuming that my conversation with you is meant for and/or is indicator of my behavior on this topic in a more general sense. This is not the case! This is the first time I've discussed this sort of thing online (because again, arguing on the internet (though I like truegaming for affording me opportunities to have a discussion without the whole thing devolving into drivel nigh instantly)), and in person this discussion is much easier to have, what with having immediate feedback and the myriad nuances of true interpersonal communication.)"

"> just indicates that investors expected a bigger fine.

That is exactly my point. My point was that time and time again, whether it's oil companies or major banks, the fines are lower than investors expect, so the stock value often corrects afterwards to a far more favorable value than most observers would expect following the news of a major fine. The fact that BP's stock plummeted after the spill is hardly relevant when there are a mountain of variables at play beyond regulatory factors. Keep going with the condescending rhetoric, though."
"> Stop being wrong about everything you say please. Thank you.

Before I even start to respond, stop being condescending and don't insult me. If you want to start a flame war, I will just pass you off as another troll and ignore you.

Firstly, do I consider D2 ubers as part of ""beating the game"" or ""completing the game?"" Absolutely. It is widely regarded as the pinnacle event in LoD. I consider all pinnacle events as part of completing the game.

Secondly, I don't believe people consider Inferno as something that is ""extremely hard,"" but rather, extremely frustrating. I think people use both terms synonymously, but we all understand the difference without having to clarify. Gear checks in general are not difficult to overcome, they are just unpleasant to grind through. Anyone will tell you grinding for gear/gold is not difficult, just time consuming and tedious.

Also, if you even bothered to read my previous response, I said time is not a measurement of difficulty to me. So posting game completion times for other games does nothing to persuade me otherwise.

> I could go on for ages. 120 hours of gameplay from a 4-man team dedicated to beating the game with a lot of experience in the genre who work together, build properly and share loot? That's not fast in any way whatsoever. 

I don't know why you keep putting words into my mouth. Once again, I said my group of friends were average casual gamers who played this game to completion. Their teamwork, coordination, and mechanics are average. That shows me this game isn't difficult, but more of a time commitment, which, I will re-iterate, I do not consider ""difficult."" Also, I never claimed that their completion time was fast.

> 120 hours is by no means even close to ""fast"" for this game.

Once again, I never said, in any of my posts, 120 hours was a fast completion time. I considered 120 hours to beat D3 just an average time for an average group.

> Also, speaking for everyone when it comes to a game's difficulty because your friends beat the game in a less than average span of time is just plain stupid.

I didn't speak for everyone. I stated my opinions just as you have stated your opinions. I used my friends beating D3 in 120 hours as an example of why I have my opinions."

So you do agree that it is partially that they are ""evil"" considering you said it's both. 


I think you are getting hung up on the definition of sane. Plenty of ""sane"" people have killed people for pleasure. 

> Goos way to phrase it. It is the problem with you. Having a mental illness does not remove agency. You can still make choices while suffering from a mental illness, and murder counts. Lots of people with terrifying mental illness have not murdered dozens and injured 500.

Actually mental illness does remove agency often times in the law. That is why people go to rehab or asylums instead of jail.

">She's not a doctor and not informed enough to make a choice regarding prescription drugs.

That is an incredibly condescending attitude toward somebody neither of us know.

Some of us are willing to take more risks than others, some are super punctual and some aren't.

">but being okay with the phrase ""the majority of us would rather see you back in the metaphorical kitchen"" is embarrassing, point blank. Sorry.

I think you might be missing some context here, I doubt the guy literally meant that majority of alt-righters want to see me in locked to the stove, I think he was referring to traditional gender roles.

>Being ""the woman"" in a relationship also doesn't have to mean staying in the home all day.

When I was talking about being the woman in a relationship I was talking about playing the passive role (traditionally feminine), and letting the guy play the active role (traditionally masculine) role.

>A more accurate term for the role you want to play is called being ""the housewife,"" which again is not necessarily bad per se, but not synonymous.

Yes when it comes to marriage and kids, that would also imply being the primary caretaker while the man is the primary provider, which is I think what works best for most people. 

Also, you didn't address my point about it being 21st century, meaning that women can work from home while taking care of their children. I work from home for the last what 5 years. I don't see any reason why it would not be possible to continue doing that when I have kids if I so desire?

>Being the woman in a relationship means just that: existing as a person of the female gender who is also in a given relationship. Same with being a man

That is simply not true and you know it. Men and women evolved to be attracted to different qualities in the opposite sex and that is where traditional gender roles in courtship and romance come from. ""Gender equality"", while I'm all in favor of it in societal terms meaning equality under the law, has no place in romance because it just doesn't work like that. 

>No one should get to tell you where they ""want you to be"" in that facet.

People have the right to tell me whatever they want, meanwhile I can tell them to go fuck themselves if I don't like what they said.

You implying that I want what I want in life because ""that's the only thing that these anime nazis will allow"" or because they told me ""who they want me to be"" is incredibly condescending.

"> If holding your nose and voting for someone imperfect in the presidential election equates to abandoning your principles, then you were never seriously involved in politics in the first place.

OK, first off, fuck what you stand for. Not because of whatever political ideology you may prescribe to or who you voted for or why you voted for them. Fuck what you stand for because you believe that someone who will not make a lesser of two evils approach is not someone with any vested interest in politics. Genuinely and truly, fuck you. Your little insinuation is nothing more than a little insult for the very fact that I have come to a different conclusion than you and I believe the best way to support my principles is to make it clear I will not vote for someone who doesn't represent them, and therefore you must be belittle my values and rationale because they are are different from yours. I wont even criticize you for the lesser of two evils idea you support, I just merely disagree. I do see the logic in it, however, and I do respect the decision. So don't take that as why I am telling you to get fucked. It is simply because instead of saying I have come to a different conclusion to how I must uphold my principles in the hope of one day seeing them returned to the public discourse that I have now lost any right to claim a vested interest in politics.

In fact, let me tell you a little something, a little simple to digest reason on I truly cannot come to a conclusion on who is the true lesser of two evils. I remember way back when I had taken one of those little isidewith.com tests. When it was all said and done I had gotten in the low 40% for both Trump and Clinton. Both had been more or less equally opposed to my ideals by that admittedly rough and imperfect metric, but I still feel it was rather accurate at showing my disdain for the two on a policy and ideological level. 

So at that point for a lesser of two evils it starts going from policy to the other factors. Who was going to be the most corrupt? Who was going to further push the fringe elements I disagree with on both sides (progressives/regressives on the left, social conservatism/alt-right on the right). Who would have the least effect on the increase of money in politics? Who would, after being elected, lead to genuine self-reflection on the errors of both sides of the isle? These are questions that I honestly can only guess, and considering on a policy level they are both against any ideas I hold dear they are also what I would be required to base my lesser of two evils argument on. 

>Serious activists who can do their work and then make a slight compromise in the presidential election that is not tantamount to abandoning all of their principles and ceding any effect on the political process.

This is actually quite possibly the only thing really worth saying in your last post. However, I am not seeing any sort of movement that reflects my ideas. As a liberal (and by a liberal I mean a true, classic liberal, not someone who thinks they can hold the mantle of liberalism simply by their mere existence on the political left side of the isle such as the progressives and mainstream democrats). So I will make you a deal, if you can find me a movement that is dedicated to individualism and liberalism and completely rejects the notion of collectivism and authoritarianism that I am able to be an active member of in the middle of Bumfuck, South Carolina I will be happy to join their ranks.

>So really, a claim like that only reveals that you are not involved beyond a vote every four years.

Fucking really? I don't get the oppertunity to be part of these little activist groups because nobody stands for my fucking principles. Both the left and right wing are opposed to them, and I don't see much of an emergence of political groups that are close to reflecting liberal ideals outside of the Libertarians, which unfortunately fucked themselves with Gary Johnson because it came out he was a closet retard. So all I get to do is try my best to listen to both sides of the isle and be as pluralistic as possible, come to my own conclusions on what is best and then stick to my guns and try to spread my perspective to all of the people who are willing to hear them, and that is what I do constantly. Work, Faceook, friends, family, etc. I ENJOY discussing politics. I ENJOY debate. But I don't fucking have a team to share a jersey with, not where I live, I do the best I can. So once again, fuck you for being a condescending fuck. "

But after having been corrected - not once, not twice, not tenfold, not hundredfold - they JUST will continue to misinterprete and distort.

A fascist is, as defined by Webster is: a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition

Also, a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control

Do I think he is a fascist? I think it's worth a debate. I think he's an authoritarian who, if ever given the opportunity to rewrite the constitution (hypothetical) would never allow for a free press, would punish those who speak out against him, would certainly not provide a system of check and balances, and would undoubtedly enrich himself if that means the suffering of his own people, kind of like Putin. He has an obsession with other authoritarian dictators like Kim, Duarte, Putin, etc. Personally, I don't think he gives two shits about democracy and the system that was developed by our founding fathers. He wants what he wants, with no input from educated experts, with no checks, and he doesn't care who he has to fire or run over to get it done. That's now how America became the greatest country on the planet.

No one is saying all you should do is vote. However, I've never thought of voting as a hugely cumbersome process. I register to vote at the post office and drop off my absentee ballot when it gets mailed to me. Then you can demonstrate, picket, strike, or whatever else you want. Voting is just the low hanging fruit and if you aren't willing to take 15 minutes out of your year to do it, then you're probably not exactly going to be writing your politicians, demonstrating, or taking any other direct action. Most of the positive change in this country has happened through participation in the system. We need more participation, not less.

I'd rather be part of the tug-of-war than one of the folks sitting on the sidelines waiting to get splashed with more mud.

Bernie also get's Noam Chomsky and Richard Wolff's approval which is good enough for me:

>The Bernie effect: Noam Chomsky says Sanders will push the Democratic Party to the left

Roughly 50% of single mothers in the US are living in poverty, in most European countries that number is roughly 10%. This is exactly because of an expanded social safety net, better daycare and universal healthcare. 

Voting for Bernie Sanders could lead to positive change for a lot of people, it could help single mothers, disabled people, unemployed people, etc. We live in a capitalist system and I'm 100% in favour of making this shit system as tolerable as possible for poor people.

The difference between a fully automated machine like the one I'm describing/using and the semi-automatic ones is really not that big.

"> Coincidence. Nifty. You can discard all sorts of data with this word and you don't even have to engage in a detailed analysis. Convenient, huh?

I don't have to discard ""all sorts of data"" because you haven't provided any. Your article was about how Mars was close enough to Earth during the polar melting part of its seasonal cycle that observers could see the change in ice cap extent first-hand.

It doesn't say anything about long-term warming trends on Mars.

> You have raised the first church of man is the only variable that can affect anything to the level of a sexual fetish. Christensen isn't saying that it is crazy that there is some (do you know what this word means?) impact, he is saying that it is crazy to assign 100% contribution to solar activity. You are saying that man is 100% responsible. I am saying that man is less than 100% responsible, and don't get off as I state my opinion. Aside from this there isn't much difference between us though I doubt you would ever admit it.

You're placing words in my mouth. Nowhere in this thread have I offered an explanation for modern warming. However, you have - it's the sun. That's the only thing that Mars and Earth have in common and is a large enough forcing to even potentially cause simultaneous warming. Yet, we know from direct observations on Earth that modern warming isn't due to the sun because (a) there isn't enough change in energy over the past 100 years to cause observed warming and (b) the phase of the change in solar output isn't even correlated with modern warming. 

Furthermore, there is no record of warming on Mars. What you don't even understand is that we don't have global temperature measurements of Mars. So I'm inaccurate by sin of omission in that when I say there's no long-term warming trend on Mars, what I really mean to say is that we have no measurements of a long-term warming trend on Mars. On the other hand, you're totally misrepresenting snippets of actual data to make your silly point, which isn't even supported by first-hand measurements of the thing that would actually cause warming on Mars in the first place.

Like I said: you're 15 years late to this meme.

> This is a theory. 100% causality has not been established unless you can demonstrate otherwise. I hate to break it to you kid, but science is not binary.

Yeah, you don't get to deride something as a ""theory"" and lament ""100%"" causality and contributions and then condescendingly lecture someone on what is ""science."" The only people that do that are people that are unambiguously, with no uncertainty, not scientists.

"How in the world does lower interest rates lead to deflation?

I am in no way suggesting that lowering interest rates causes deflation. My point is that when you face inflation, either interest rates will increase or deflation will occur in order to force the market to clear. If the Fed keeps interest rates fixed at low rates, then the only other result available is that the bubble pops and deflation results.

>This is a contradictory and nonsensical sentence.

In what way? The sticker-price of a good may indeed remain $5.00, however when your dollar is inflated (i.e. decreased purchasing power) it will take more dollars to purchase the same $5.00 good. The problem is that prices tend to increase, and inflationary effects aren't instantaneous.

"TIL mutli-tool = laser guided rocket.

>that multi-tool would diminish load-out management and routing

Ok. How? You can carry a lock pick. You can't carry a screw driver. It still takes up the lock pick slot, with the bonus of also being a screw driver, and being able to activate the door wedge. I never said anything about being able to use it as a wrench.

Let me spell it out for you once again.

All the multi-tool would do is prevent the need to run to the well-known location of a screw driver. That is essentially all it will do, at the cost of taking longer to pick locks, and taking longer to do anything the screwdriver can dp. Now, if everyone has access to the multi-tool, then it is completely fair, all players are on a level playing field. Their level times might be decreased, they might be increased, but they will be affected evenly for all players. New routes planned, new methods discovered. Things will change, not break.

>It's a negative because alot of contracts were made with this loadout puzzle in mind. That multitool would break them. 

First argument you've made that actually makes some sort of sense. So... here's an EASY solution. What if, during your contract creation, you could X-out any items you don't want allowed in your contract? Like, when you're setting up your loadout for your contract, instead of selecting an item, you press a different button to DISABLE that item? Problem solved and I bet it wouldn't be hard at all to implement. 

As a matter of fact, that's a feature that should exist whether a multi-tool is added or not. Making contracts where all weapons/items are procure-on-site would be interesting.

>Hey lets introduce laser guided rockets, doesn't matter if it could break the game, you could simply not equip it -logic.

I never said it should just be added if it breaks the game, I said it could be balanced to NOT break the game. You're gonna have to stop with the straw-man fallacy.

>you could simply not equip it -logic.

You misunderstand. What I'm telling you is that if the item interferes with your ideal routing through a mission, don't use the item. You didn't mention anything about contracts that are designed around forcing the player to run to a closet to grab a screw driver before, you only just now brought that up. So, prior to that, I was talking about your individual playthrough - if the item ruins your flow, don't use it. It's that simple. Otherwise the only thing you're going to see happen, IF anything, is that player's mission time may be reduced by the amount of time it would normally take to retrieve a screwdriver. And like I said, that'll happen across the board. 

>Lots of people do care and are having fun competing with each other on contracts.

Ok, and I've now given two possible ways that breaking those contracts could easily be prevented.

>If you think that any item can just be introduced without taking into consideration what it would do to the existing parts, well i'm sorry, i can't agree. I find that even more incredibly short-sighted and ignorant.

I made it extremely clear that I know the items would require balancing. I even suggested several ways in how to do that. Do I know the exact formula? No, but it's evident from what I've said that I KNOW the item could be OP if not balanced properly. So you're assessment here is bunk. 

>Or you know, just don't introduce items that disrupt the balance of the game so much. 

Or, as I've said over and over, balance those items. It's pretty simple.

Like I said before, I don't care if you disagree. That's FINE, everyone has their own way of playing the game and if the multi-tool is incompatible with your chosen method of enjoying the game, I can't argue with that. But once again, it's your condescending tone that pissed me off right off the bat. You act like you're some Hitman god or something. You're not, sorry to tell you. And just on the basis of definition alone, no, none of what you're saying is FACT until you can prove it. And until a mutli-tool is put into the game, you can never prove it. Until then it is a theory. But instead of discussing with me how it could maybe fit into the game, you dismiss it right off the bat and throw a very, very weak argument behind your opinion, while also stating it all as fact. Forgive me if I'm a little testy with you, but you're quite arrogant. It's annoying as fuck.

Don't worry, you are being politely offensive enough... sure all kids cry for a reason. They want attention. They are sleepy. They are hungry. Not all cries and tears and tantrums are what rational adults would consider an appropriate reason to cry. You're the one coming off like you don't have kids or haven't ever been around children. There's many reasons why we don't consider children as mature and one of those reasons is because they don't know how to properly emotionally express themselves and especially at knowing what time to do so. But again, you'll avoid the point I was making and pretend that all babies have perfectly rational justifications for crying every single time and that I don't understand the psychology behind it. The leftists in this thread have turned this subreddit into a dump site so they can just cry like babies all day."
">Again, that's a false equivalence. The same media is being consumed whether at home or on a large screen, it's not nearly the same as changing the art that is being consumed.

"> But yes, the US does have many private schools. 

Again, you don't know what you're talking about. The schools may be called ""private"" but they are anything but. The education market is ruined by government intervention and these ""private"" schools are slaves to an unending list of government regulations. This is why the price of education is so high in the United States, in addition to the availability of tens of thousands of dollars of funding for every student. It's not a private market for education, it's a market that is perverted by government intervention, which has driven the price into the stratosphere, which is what ALWAYS happens when the government intervenes like this. Of course this point has sailed right over your head, because you insist on engaging with me on an issue you're wholly ignorant on.

My entire point is that the high prices are a consequence of the idiotic idea to get the government involved in education, which is what you're advocating. You're essentially using a problem caused by what you're advocating, to justify it. Keep calling me a moron though...

> When Nintendo makes their contract with their Chinese production lines, that they have a crystal ball that tells them how many units of a brand new console, coming off the eve of a poorly received console, they need to have made?

Like I said, just enough to break previous sales records. That way, if they sell through it, then they've got hype they can generate, if not then oh well, there's no loss because they wouldn't have a massive number of unsold units. Nintendo isn't the only company that does this, so I'm not sure why it seems to be a surprise to someone of your alleged knowledge and experience.

> When do you think Nintendo started talking with these Chinese production lines? A day before the system launched?

Where did I even remotely suggest that? What do you think that teaser trailer in October was for? Obviously generating and gauging interest to have an idea as to how many they could expect. 

Tell me, if they weren't limiting supply in March, then why didn't they ramp up production later? Why not just, idk, start with that ramped up production? Oh wait, it's a simple answer, to generate demand though what appears to be a desirable product that everyone wants, and to protect future launch numbers. If they sold 4 million in March their future consoles would have a harder time breaking they record than the 2.4 million that just enough to set a new record."

Actually it has. If minimum wage tracked to worker productivity it would be over $25. That's the whole point here.

You could argue that allowing that money to go to the company is what leads to innovation and allows for that growth in productivity. And that would be true. Not sure why you would lie though and say productivity hasn't gone up. It has. By a lot.

">I'm living in europe, and I wouldn't even know where to look for a house that isn't built out of bricks or concrete. 

Ah, yet another instance of the ""average"" European mindset demonstrating inanely condescending snobbery with on the patented, trademarked combination of Arrogance-based-on-Ignorance (a mentality that is kind of ""cute"" ... but at the same time as it is annoying in all it's hubristic idiocy).

But it is the very fact that as you stated, you ""wouldn't even know where to look"" that is indicative of your ignorance. Because you are either looking in the wrong parts of Europe (Scandinavians still build with wood because they HAVE wood to build with), or you are looking only at the surface, and you cannot see (by ""looking"") what is really going on underneath, because a significant amount of construction that you THINK is ""bricks and concrete"" -- is in fact merely a thin facade over other structural materials (large timbers in older construction, steel in modern buildings). Bricks and concrete -- by themselves -- are actually a fairly crappy, energy inefficient, and structurally dubious construction material -- look at all of the ""ruins"" in Europe (and they are called ""ruins"" for a reason, the buildings that were once there have been ""ruined"") -- it is really only in combination with underlying steel that they become capable of being efficient and structurally sound modern building materials.

---

Of course, one of the reasons that many parts of Europe STOPPED building as much with wood, (they used to) was because they had already ""burned through"" their forests centuries ago (and ""burned through"" often quite literally, in no small part because they were trying to heat all those incredibly COLD, entirely uninsulated brick & stone monstrosities BRRRRR). As a result of all that historical fallout, despite the condescension, most Europeans aren't really CHOOSING to live ""packed together"" in non-wood homes -- its more a result of historical circumstances and what they have been STUCK WITH by their ancestors.

And it is is NOT just ""Americans"" that use ""wood frame"" construction for housing -- Canadians (who do NOT all live in igloos made of snow & ice) also build in a nearly identical fashion (and for similar reasons -- unlike in Europe -- here, wood is still a readily available and inexpensive material to use), and people in many other parts of the world that still have adequate forests also still build with wood (though a lot of it depends on climate).

Plus, wood allows Americans to have far, far LARGER homes than Europeans (stick that in your pipe and smoke it!) So while most Europeans are (again, of necessity, not choice) all squeezed together into small apartments of a couple hundred square foot, Americans can -- for the same cost or less -- have significantly roomier homes (two or three times the square footage of Europeans) as well as more land, not to mention NOT having to live ""on top of/underneath"" someone else in some ""commune-like"" concrete anthill.

---

As to Plywood -- it is in fact very good material to build with, being both structurally sound, AND very efficient way of using resources. (And there is nothing wrong with wood itself as a construction material -- just ask the Japanese.) The problem with recent American construction is NOT the use of ""plywood"", it is the use of a cheaper (and inferior) replacement for plywood known as ""oriented strand board"", made not of veneers, but of ""wood chips & slivers"" pressed/glued together that is the problem -- and then using that material in places (roof sheathing) and in home designs that they are really not suited for in regard to long term durability.

The way you put it is common, but it's pretty condescending. ""I'm allowed to respect others? Really? Ah gee, thanks.""

If they believe you're allowed, nothing. For instance circumcision, especially of the adult variety. According to them you aren't harming them, and who is supposed to know better?

>If I believe that keeping slaves or violating other human rights is ok, surely by your axiom you don't have any right to tell me I can't, right?

"No one is saying 'let's design a game solely to make money', but no company will even humor an idea if it doesn't sound profitable. Freemium games exist because of the spending habits of players in the mobile market. If 'make a fun game and it will make money' is all it took, we would see a lot more fixed-cost games, but we don't, because most people won't download a game if they have to pay for it first, even if it only costs a dollar.

Also, limiting turns/time is great from a business perspective. It gets people to come back frequently. It builds habits. It's fantastic for mobile games.

>That's not fun. Do you understand how a Skinner Box even works?

>The instant ""I Win Button"" corrupts the ""Give the Player Interesting Choices"" core game design philosophy.

Again, theory before application. Not to mention that giving players hundreds of units to pick from IS 'interesting choices'. Also, this isn't game design. This is monetization. Even if the player has potential access to all units, they would still have to actually use those units effectively.

I find your tone incredibly condescending, both in your reply to me, and to your comments further up the comment chain.

Also, as much as I hate to feed into your 'experience = authority' narrative, I'm employed in the game development industry. That being said, even if I wasn't, my statements remain valid. You don't get to decide the worth of someone's position based on the number of titles they've shipped."

"> My point was that people here could possibly benefit from reducing their mental suffering as well.

You make that sound easy. Curing mental illness is a very difficult thing. We don't have complete understanding of the human brain. Some conditions can best be helped by years of psychotherapy; some can best be helped by medication. But, you make it sound as simple as singing ""Don't worry; be happy"" (a song that actively pisses me off). I happen not to suffer from depression or other serious psychological conditions. But, I did require some therapy in my youth. It's not an easy thing even if all you've got is a ""normal"" (whatever that means) compliment of neuroses.

So, to me, this just sounds horribly condescending and moderately offensive.

Have you asked any of the specific people who've posted about their mental suffering whether they are indeed seeking help? Have you considered that such help costs money and is often poorly covered by insurance? Have you considered that some people don't even have insurance?

This attitude just sounds very holier-than-thou to me. And, I'm probably not even one of the people you're referencing since my mental health is pretty good."

Either that or ridiculously experienced with MTG and WOTC. Since, naturally, we'll never compromise on one of these options, let's call it a draw. 

> It is their solution do not killing their golden goose of paper magic/mtgo.

1. Paper magic is in crisis, and has been for a number of years. What can be considered it's modern day peak of popularity happened in 2011. That's 7 years ago for the folks who haven't been keeping up. 
2. MTGO is not a viable standalone platform without paper magic and DCI tournament buys/PW points (whatever you get from grinding it these days). 
3. Their approach of favoring paper magic stores has already landed them in hot water more than once. As time moves on, they'll either have to move to viable digital products or fade into obscurity. On top of that, their current paper store distribution model also has a number of ingrained flaws that aren't being addressed. 

> I've never met a socially normal human being who liked Magic more as a tournament grinder than an a fresh-eyed kitchen table player.

"I don't have time to go through this whole long whack of nonsense, so let's just talk about a couple of things here. 

> The diversities in early Christianity largely were Christological, attempting to understand how Jesus fit into the divine identity. [citation desperately needed]

> Also prepend ""alleged"" to ""Jesus"" and ""the divine identity."" And please tell us that how the early disputes over whether Jesus was flesh and blood but also divine, or flesh and blood only but worthy of worship, or only seemingly flesh and blood, or something else again, were ""attempts to understand how the alleged Jesus fit into the divine identity."" Just for example. After you've done that I'll bring up some of the many other instances that blow that absurd claim out of the water.

First of all, can you please stop inserting [citation needed] when quoting other people's comments? Not only is it condescending, but you're asking for citations for things that do not require them. What kind of citation are you looking for here, a first year textbook? This is not a controversial claim. 

What you've done here is simply repeated what u/psstein already said. The ""early disputes"" you've highlighted there are christological debates. They are, exactly as psstein said, attempts to understand the nature of Jesus and his relationship to the divine. There are no 'absurd claims' here. Your use of christology elsewhere in your post indicates that you don't quite understand the term, so perhaps that's where the confusion lies. 

psstein says: In Byzantine history, there are no secular sources attesting a great deal of material, but there's no doubt as to the historicity of Justinian's persecuting the miaphysites.

And you answer: Yeah, so what?

The point is that you're rejecting the historicity of all early Christian material, thus rejecting Jesus as a historical figure, but you're evidently willing to accept the historicity of other historical individuals and events based on similar evidence. That doesn't make sense. 


A final quick point because I have to get back to work - Paul can be considered a source for the HJ because he was writing at a time very shortly after Jesus' death. He was in regular contact with people who knew Jesus personally, including Jesus' brother James. They had a bit of a falling out, as you may recall. It was kind of a big deal. 

You talk a lot and try to use a lot of big words, but it's pretty clear that you're just reciting talking points. These are not your ideas, you have not done the work to come to these conclusions on your own. I'm happy to have a discussion - I mean, it's what I do for a living - but the condescension and arrogance you've displayed in this thread hasn't been earned. Maybe try to scale it back a bit, hey? 

"
"Ok, ok, let's pause for a moment here, and let's take it point by point, shall we?

>1) I agree that instead of saying «You will change your mind», I should have said: « Not wanting a child at a moment in life is sometimes (could I say ""often""??) a temporary thing in life. As all our decisions/positions in life, they can change in life, and there are many cases of people who in their 20s did not ever envision to be parents and who later for many reasons felt it was then the right time for them to be parents.... »

Ah yes, a passive-aggressive re-phrasal of a condescending quip. Let me help you along. In English, if you wish to indicate future possibility, you may use the word ""may"" which is different from the word ""will"". The problem with ""You will change your mind."" is not that it is only rude, but that it is condescending, holier-than-thou AND dismissive at the same time.

Your rephrase, I think, does your argument no justice. Even if we were to take the phrase: ""You may change your mind."", that is just a gum-flapping sound in order for you to fill the silence with wannabe sage-y advice that is not warranted. To put it into perspective, you may die tomorrow from a brick falling down on your head. I hardly think that you go around cautioning people that: ""You may die from a brick falling on your head tomorrow.""

Any number of things may happen in the future. Without any knowledge of that person's internal logic (and likely, knowledge of a stance that has been thoroughly debated inside one's internal forum), your quips are made from a place of hubris: ""Look at me, I know your mind better than you, poor misguided fool, and I know that you will change your mind."" 

How very compassionate of you.

>2) I can try to phrase my opinion with all the caution necessary, making sure not to overstep the freedom of the person on her choices. However I find also equally unproductive when someone writes in this forum about her hesitations/doubts/fear of whether to be a parent or not, and Tens of people line up to stress that she/he is right not to want kids and to enforce her in her belief.

/r/childfree is a support group much as anything else. We don't have to censor ourselves out of a fear of not providing equal representation for all viewpoints. What you're asking is rather silly. I, personally, do not go to /r/parenting and demand that they give equal consideration to the childfree lifestyle, because I understand what the point of a subreddit is.

>3) I don´t want to sound arrogant or whatever, but I just think my reaction if someone is 20 y/o and has doubts/fear on being a parent would be different from the case of someone who is 45 and is happy without kids. to the 20 y/o I would just say, let life run it course, you may change opinion, many have done, some have not, don´t focus on this issue ... to the 45, I would certainly say that as long as he/she has a fullfilling life, helping others... then he certainly as accomplished as everyone else.

What is this brand of inanity, I don't even...

Look. Being childfree (along with several other points) are deal-breakers in relationships. The issue of children, the issue of religion, the issue of money, and the issue of career paths are things that absolutely MUST be discussed before entering a long-term-relationship. You can't simply play-by-ear when it comes to these issues. This is not an issue that can be compromised.

THINKING of those issues is of paramount importance, if one wants to have a stress-free and carefree life. Advising people to not think of these issues because they will sort themselves out is absolutely inane, and batshit delusional.

If a 20 year old thinks of those things, GOOD FOR THEM. They're already halfway better off than someone just drifting through life by instinct and trusting that: ""God will provide"" or some other brand of 'feel-good'ism.

>4) I don´t think that sharing my experience can be dismissed as an Anectode . We are all here sharing our experiences. In this case, everytime someone refers to a real life experience you will be dismissing it.

See, you got it all wrong. All experiences an be dismissed as anecdotes. Whether or not a person does so depends on multiple factors, but there's no ""equal consideration for all anecdotes"" law.

>5) Your first sentence in last paragraphe is really confusing me: « Let's use real arguments about having kids versus choosing not to, and give me some facts». First of all because you ask for facts, but you tell me not to use my personal example. Are you expecting statistics? Some big arguments such as how society would evolve if a majority of people decide to staty childfree? Second because I consider having a child or not, a personal choice, there is arguments going stacking the positive aspects vs negative aspects and drawing a universal conclusion for everyone.

Sigh, sigh, sigh.

You're right, your personal experience of how you paid 25 euro for a bike is so much more relevant.

Statistics don't real, only FEELS.

>6) Waving the big flag of ""Respect People Choice"" while sounds when said this way, shall not be used as a way to shut up those who have a different opinion. People come here to share their stories/opinion and hear other ones. Entering attack mode by digging the weakness in the written sentences to dismiss the underlying argument is actually also unfair.

Well, if you did not want people to dig at your weak argument, maybe you should not have made it weak in the first place.

No one here is a mind reader. If you cannot make a salient point without the use of rhetoric and poorly-reasoned anecdotes, then you have no business expecting to be taken seriously. Likewise, no one is obligated to salvage your argument and prop up a seaworthy argument, and debate against that. That's just silly.

Moreover, I'll tie in this next quote because it's a gem screaming ""opinion entitlement"".

>(2) I don´t understand the argument of ""this is our space"". This is really against any vision of democracy and sharing of thoughts. Shall pro-parents stay in their subreddit sharing the pics of their ( stupid) kids and ChidFree people stay in their subreddit just counting how much they saved on not having kids ( I am stereo-typing here...) . As a basic tenent of democracy and free speech, I think that it is by having a civilized dialog and argument that we move forward and better ourselves.

First off, free speech does not exist in private space. If someone enters your home and starts ranting, you have every right to kick him out. Free speech and democracy is valid only in the public sphere. It is good practice, certainly, to listen to everyone's opinion, but you are absolutely not entitled to protected speech.

Secondly, no one has silenced you, from what I can tell. No one deleted your messages, or put undue pressure on you to not post. No one threatened you. I've had this argument in the past, and I'll say it here again. Free speech does not entitle you to being taken seriously by everyone all the time. No one is obligated to show equal consideration to your opinion. 

The responsibility for making a coherent and compelling argument falls on you alone. I've seen this misconception from many people, claiming that they're being persecuted when they're just not being taken seriously. Are you fucking kidding me?

>7) Your initial argument establishing a symmetry between telling someone who does not have a child ( but still is plenty in the age of having one) that she will (I agree I shall have said she may) change her mind vs telling someone who has a child and telling her that she will change her mind is to my opinion Flawed. Because actually the situation is not at all symmetric. [...]

First off. Appeal to consequence is a logical fallacy. An argument becomes no more or no less worthy if the consequences to it are ""terrible"". The argument is symmetric, even if consequences are displeasing to you. Too bad, suck it up.

Secondly, even if we were to admit that the argument is not symmetric (just for the sake of argument, because I'm a good sport), your argument becomes spastic at best. If you look above at point 3), you advised that not worrying about kids is the way to go!

Waaait a minute. Either the consequences for not considering what a kid entails are horrific and terrible, or the issue of kids-vs-no kids can be played by the ear. You cannot make both arguments at the same time. Or rather, you could, but you end up with an incoherent, spastic argument to which no one is going to pay attention. 

And then you'll cry persecution for not being taken seriously."

> The lack of replayability comes up A LOT in these games. Let me say, as a thrifty board gamer who was also skeptical at the get-go, playing Pandemic:Legacy has been an IMMENSELY rewarding experience for me and my game group. 

I would bet that this reaction is a lot more common than you might think for those of us who were skeptical and then played it. Now I am not saying everyone who is skeptical and plays a legacy game will love them but there are quite a few of us.

> Well that's just objectively wrong.

Well let's talk about that. It is a bit odd to say that my subjective opinion of a perceived difference between regular campaign-style games and legacy-style campaign games is ""objectively wrong."" But we'll ignore the subjectivity of their perceived value and look at exactly how legacy games feel to me and how that differs from a campaign game as I imagine some of what I enjoy and feel is different about legacy games is shared by some of the others who enjoy them. 

Legacy games feel to me like a mashup between an RPG-lite (without the need for a GM) and roguelike games on the computer, all in boardgame form. When I play most computer games that have a save feature, we'll use Baldur's Gate 2 for an example, I am an excessive saver and I will utilize those saves to save scum to replay fights or conversations to get the perfect situation I want. Now I could use a walkthrough or cheats to have the same sort of result as reloading saves but I want the experience of all those situations. However I also love the freedom offered by games with a roguelike experience or an ironman mode... where my decisions are final and I can't go reload them and replay the situation: it changes the way I play. Now I could still save scum in these sorts of games... there is usually some way to do it but it is usually just slightly too inconvenient. Legacy-style games are the same; they offer a ironman mode or sort of roguelike experience in a board game. A campaign board game could be played in this way but the lack of permanence changes the way the players play because they ultimately know that none of this is permanent. I know this because I have played Pandemic Legacy as both a legacy game and as a version I modified to be replayed... the replayable version changed the way we all played very heavily. 

Space Alert's expansion The New Frontier adds a campaign mode that adds a tiny little dash of legacy for those who want to give it a try and don't mind Space Alert's hectic nature. Roll up a character and decide allow them to be cloned... it is a ton of fun and just a bit stressful knowing that if your character dies, they are permanently dead. It really does change the types of missions you agree to sign on to. It gives a bit of a taste of the difference between a legacy experience and a regular campaign. Both have their place.

> They leveraged the Risk brand and then Pandemic (both hugely popular games, one for casuals and no one for enthusiasts) because if they attempted the concept with a brand new franchise consumers would have laughed them out the door.

This is ridiculous... do you realize how many reviewers of Risk Legacy in the hobbyist market felt the Risk brand actively hurt their enjoyment of Risk Legacy. Sooo many people were like this is super innovative and interesting butttt... it is still on the Risk engine. Risk Legacy fought me for interest based on both the legacy mechanic and because it was Risk. The only reason I gave it a try was because of a lot of encouragement from people to at least give it a try... I would have never given it the time of day otherwise. Hardly anyone in the hobbyist market defends Risk Legacy based on the Risk brand, except maybe that, ""if you like Risk you should probably try Risk Legacy because it is a way better game than vanilla Risk."" Risk was chosen as a vehicle for legacy games because Rob Daviau worked at Hasbro when he developed the idea and yes legacy needed to be done on an existing franchise because this is Hasbro we are talking about, but they never saw this as a big marketing opportunity; he basically had to sneak it past them to get it developed. 

Pandemic was not supposed to be the next legacy game... Seafall, a completely new franchise, was but Seafall was a much more ambitious and larger game than the other two and got stuck in design and development. Every other legacy game announced so far, other than Pandemic Legacy: Season 2, is a new franchise: Gloomhaven, Chronicles: Origin, and I guess Quickfight: A Legacy Game is something that has a BGG page. This is hardly some giant trend of legacy games being produced to ""exploit the customer."" Since the first legacy game, Risk Legacy, released in 2011 there have been two more legacy games... in the loosest sense of a legacy game: Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 and We Didn't Playtest This: Legacy
So from 2011-2015 they were like 2.5 legacy games. And then announced 2016-2017 there are 4-5 legacy games announced. This is hardly some colossal trend... compare this to Dominion-style deckbuilders and how they built up over the same period of time to see a real trend.

> It's very, very good marketing and it's good for Z-man Games, but it's absolutely awful for the consumer.

Pandemic Legacy is good for Z-man games because it is a very good game. I don't personally think it is the best game ever but it is up there. It is awful for you to assume that in this situation that the consumer has no agency... it is not awful for them... if they don't like the idea of the game they aren't forced to buy it. A lot of us really like the idea of the game. 

> Appending ""Season 1"" takes it one step further and exploits the average board game enthusiast's propensity to collect.

You really have such a poor view of the customer and your fellow boardgame enthusiasts that you just assume that all of us who enjoy legacy games have just been suckered into some sort of exploitative marketing ploy. 

tldr: Sorry for the colossally long response but I really felt I needed to show you where I thought you made no sense. Your view of board game customers is condescending. You have given no evidence of how campaign games will fill the board game enthusiasts desire for legacy games. And your theory of the publishers support of the legacy mechanic seems like a conspiracy theory with how it ignores the history of legacy games' development."

Discord is an Electron app. It's even listed in the ""Apps built on Electron"" section on Electron's home page. Electron apps are basically a Node.js backend bundled with a Chromium browser as the frontend. Therefore, the entire GUI is designed with HTML and CSS. (You can clearly see that if you open the Discord app and press Ctrl+Shift+I. That will open the Chromium developer tools. (You can then use those tools to clearly see that every link in Discord is actually an `<a>` tag.))

> [...] even if it's the case, the end user doesn't view it this way.

What does it matter if the end user sees it that way or not? The Discord GUI is a HTML page. Every link on that HTML page is a hyperlink. Whether this fact is apparent to the typical user or not is entirely irrelevant.

When I was a ""Young Adult"" you just read books, now you have a genre specifically catered to being simpler for your to understand.

There is a spectrum. There has generally speaking always been a spectrum. And there will always be a spectrum. The weirdest thing is that it doesn't seem as though you even have a problem with the fact that these games exist that are simpler and less complex.

 Do you believe that a long term natural trend means that there can't be meaningful man-made shorter term impacts?

">This country, like most democracies, is built upon a social contract. That contract protects the weak and the sick. That contract is why we have cops, medicare, firefighters, unemployment insurance, welfare, etc.

So you ground your claims to be able to spend other people's money on the status quo, and not what ought to be? Your claim to the status quo is a fallacy.

Another fallacy you made is claiming that there exists a ""contract"" that we are all compelled to obey. Well, show me that contract, and I will be happy to refuse to sign it. What's that? The contract doesn't actually exist, because the contract is assumed? Hmm, convenient for you isn't it? You demand that I and everyone else follow a contract that none of us signed, because it doesn't exist, for the sole reason that we must all follow contracts! Can you not see your bullshit as you write it?

Sure, we can argue over whether the ""weak"" and the ""sick"" are ""protected"" in a government hampered economy (which you call ""democracy""). But what you can't do is assume it is true, without proof, and then using that as a premise to claim that your position is true, and that anyone who attacks such a ridiculous premise is automatically labeled a heretic. You know, there have been some oppressive tyrants in history who have used that same exact tactic. It doesn't work on the educated, so you might as well give it up.

I can make an argument that the ""weak"" and the ""sick"" are much better off living in a purely capitalist system.

>Your tone might be conscending and insulting, but that's nowhere near the worst part.

Obviously the shoe is on the other foot. I am not the one who is claiming to know how to spend other people's money better than the people themselves.

YOU are the one who is being condescending and insulting, not me. I am not the one who is trying to convince others that they don't know the best way to spend their own money. You are.

>The worst part of your argument is that by clamoring for the right to keep your precious money, you're calling for an end to those social protections.

So your solution for solving ""social protection"" problems is to abolish the protection of one's belongings from unscrupulous thieves? You want to have more protection for people by protecting people less? How is that reasonable?

>I'm going to hazard a guess that, in your head, you have a great way to keep the few social protections you happen to like right now without anybody being forced to pay for it. If you do, you're most likely deluded.

Of course you would hazard a guess at what is in my head, because you don't care what actually is in my head enough to ask first. For how can you have the time to actually ask people what they want? You are too busy telling people what they should want to sit back and ask them first. Asking people what they want is for pussies isn't it? Ya, society needs big strong douchebags like yourself to order everyone around, as if you are immune to not knowing what people want, and everyone else is stricken with a disease of not knowing what they themselves want.

>If you're calling for destroying every social protections and ushering an era of utter chaos, then at least you're consistent all the way through, except for implying my aim is to destroy human rights, since your utopia would do it so much more efficiently.

We need to be taken of our wealth by the geniuses in elected office says you, because if we aren't, then who will tell us what to do? Who will guide society according to their subjective desires? We don't want a society of free individuals, who each are able to achieve what they want, which includes helping themselves as well as others, because then THAT would be chaos!

Can I ask you something? Do you ever read anything above the Dr. Suess level? Have you ever mentally matured enough to know that adults don't need to be stolen from in order to do the right thing? Are you still a child in your mind? Do you want society to be full of dependent children who would all die off in the millions if they aren't stolen from by the government?

This country, to fucking EDUCATE you, was never supposed to be a ""democracy"". It was started, and it was intended to stay, as a Constitutional Republic. It was supposed to be a country of limited government, meaning limited to protecting violations of individual liberty, and free individuals who are free to pursue their destinies. This was the only system that allowed full fledged Capitalism and economic progress to occur. The founders HATED democracy, or how I like to call it, mob rule. I don't want to be ruled by any fucking mob. The mob is fucking ignorant. The mob was convinced that weapons were in Iraq. The mob was convinced that God exists. The mob was convinced that inflation is not caused by the Fed. The mob was convinced that Bush really was going to be a good President.

"> Well I never suggested eliminating suburban commuters (or rural people who have to drive 30 miles to get to the nearest hardware store, also contributing to gas tax revenues). I suggested that we enact policies that would reduce subsidies on those lifestyles, marginally increasing their cost. This alteration in incentives would lead some people to choose to live more urban lives, and would slightly shift the demographic balance so that a greater proportion of people live in urban areas. If you want to live a suburban or rural lifestyle, that's your prerogative, but it has high costs for the state and you should have to bear more of those costs versus them being borne by the general tax fund.

Every action by the government has a ripple effect on society. Our infrastructure is already underfunded, so how would disincentivizing the use of them reverse that situation? If a higher percentage of individuals lived in the city and did not use a car, then the budget situation will only get worse and society would have to dip into the general fund even more to pay for road repairs.

> I think that is partially cultural. They are culturally conditioned to be used to more cramped spaces and closer contact with other people. They don't see it as a big deal. You look at other very popular transit systems in New York and Europe and they don't have that issue, people wouldn't stand for it and its an easily solved problem.

New York and Europe don't come close to the population density or riders per hour numbers of Beijing or Tokyo. If it's easily solved, how do you do it?

>$1,000 is still an appreciable amount of money. Again, I'm just talking about at the margin. You get rid of the home interest deduction, you get rid of some of the highway subsidies, you allow for more attractive schooling options in the city, there were already the city benefits of needing fewer car(s) and having lower energy bills, and all the sudden a few more people who were already on the fence about where they wanted to live have decided to move into the city. If reducing subsidies on suburban living shifted only 5% to 10% of the current suburban and rural population into urban areas, that would have a big effect. It would decrease energy prices for everyone, decrease oil imports, and improve the national balance sheet.

I think you're vastly overestimating the effects of these subsidies if you honestly believe that you would see an additional 15 to 30 million people move to the nation's cities due to any of these changes. You are also underestimating the economic benefit of the businesses located in the suburbs. Currently, the US has an urbanization rate of 80.2%. What goal are you trying to accomplish with these changes?

> These are AMERICAN urban problems, which I believe are symptomatic of 50 years of policy that subsidized wealthier people to move out into the suburbs.

> If I'm living an economically sustainable life in a city, and yeah dealing with some of the downsides that you mentioned, I don't want to be paying the mortgage on your house and paying for more than half of your roads.

I find it condescending of you to think that the only sustainable lifestyle is an urban one. How do you think that your food gets to the table? Or that the multitude of your gadgets and gizmos are engineered, manufactured, and transported? They happen because to the network of infrastructure that exists outside of urban areas. You may look at it as paying for my mortgage, but remember, it's a tax deduction, not a credit. It's meant to help offset the costs of home ownership not only in suburbia but in the city as well (condos are not exempt from MID).

> Don't even open the farm subsidies discussion. Rural people get too much support, and it's bad for the country. It raises the price of energy and funds hostile governments.

That's a great way to make food prices skyrocket, put significant downward pressure on global food supplies, and increase rates of nutrition deficiency among the poor.

>There is no better way to disprove the infallibility of the bible than with the bible itself

What do you consider meaningful, the book or the message in the book? One is timeless, the other is just text. The bible is actually many books written by different people for different reasons, but there is a trend throughout the whole thing, which is that worldly suffering is fleeting and that through faith and living a good life a person can overcome the imperfections in the world and in themselves and touch on something higher. 

See that? That's why people read the bible. When you understand that you realize the book isn't really the issue.

Which would mean they're paying -above- the inflation adjusted minimum wage from 1955-1975.

Then you have to consider, in order for that person to collect food stamps on a 40 hour per week job they need to be the sole provider for a family of two. I'm going to have to take a wild guess and say that's not average for a Walmart employee.

But hey, lets pretend none of that is true. Would you prefer Walmart increase their wages and decrease their workforce so people have no jobs and no work experience and put them fully on welfare? Or let Walmart hire more people and subsidize the welfare system?

One thing that I've found is usually true about liberals is how they don't know how poor people get by. In my experience, I've never met a person who received food stamps and didn't sell or trade them. You have to be stupid not to. You just go to the food bank or the food whole saler and get all the food you want for free/extremely cheap. Ever go to a food bank? Not a soup kitchen, those are for the homeless. Food banks are usually set up next to super markets because super markets can unload their food that's close to expiration and receive a charitable tax writeoff for it. Go there some time and tell me how the women look. Are they disheveled? Or do they have their hair and nails done with a pound of makeup on? Priorities.

>government subsidies for all low wage workers is about $153 billion a year. 

I doubt it, but in any event, would you rather low wage workers be out of a job and increase the amount they're being subsidized so they never get any work experience it get a better job and thus get trapped on welfare?

>One thing I have trouble wrapping my head around is the conservative animus against low wage workers and zero animus against the companies that pay so low that their workers require government benefits for basic necessities that you and I end up paying for.

Yes, we just hate low wage workers... It has nothing to do with a differing point of view or an increased amount of information we've received. The logical conclusion is we hate low waged workers. Just to frame how condescending this is, it's like if I read your post and said, ""I just don't understand why liberals want people getting trapped on welfare. Why do liberals have such disdain for low wage workers they want to kick them out of their jobs.""

>Liberals want to give the fishing pole in the form of well-funded education for everyone,

I recently went on a date with a 30 year old college grad making 30k per year, paying off her student loans because she received a bad major in political sciences. Why do liberals want to lie to untalented/dumb people and saddle them with debt and useless majors?

>health care

Giving away healthcare is self sufficiency... sometimes I wonder if liberals use doublethink on purpose or it's accidental.

>green infrastructure jobs to put people in the best position to fish.

Are you familiar with how green energy works? No? Didn't think so. Jobs in solar panels and wind powers are growing dramatically right now because they're new. The issue is, they take little to no maintenance after they're installed so the vast majority of the jobs are for short periods of time and the reason why solar for instance is growing is because of government subsidies. Literally giving away fish.

>In case your fishing pole breaks, liberals don’t want you to starve as you fix it.

That's not the job of government, that's the job of private charity and the church.

>Conservatives, on the other hand, would rather you fish with your hands or maybe use your bootstraps for fishing line, unless you were born into a family that has extra fishing poles.

"I replied to Mshotts in a manner that might interest you as well.

>Well they are big boys but they don't have the toys to back it up. 

I disagree with your analysis. Our share in military expenditure is, taken together, not as big as the US (of course), but more than enough to defend the EU if we had a unified military. The latter part is the real problem.

You are right that we cannot act. I just doubt you have the right reasons in mind. The response I gave above points out what I think the underlying problem is here: we have no political will or sufficient external threat in order to force each member state to essentially give up their autonomous military service. On the other hand, no single member state is strong enough to project power in all of Europe.

This creates a horrible dilemma, especially since the existence of the US and US intervention makes any solution redundant. But I believe this isn't about money, rather about how we use it. Right now, each member state spends it on its own military, hence you get 28 different militaries that cannot act in unison, each strong enough to protect its own nation but nothing much else.

The same money would buy you a force that would be the 2nd strongest on this planet. For reasons mentioned above, this isn't happening. If Russia continues to strong-arm its neighbour, we might finally get some real world motivation.

>Every time I get some Europhile saying how civilized the continent is[..]

Do I hear some condescending satisfaction in your comment? Being pro-EU isn't neccessarily linked with being distanced from reality or blind to security matters. The answers you got are based on the simple fact that there has not been a major conflict between serious powers in whatever was the EU at that point.

Do you even realise how crazy this is to a European? The last time there was so much peace in and between so many European countries for so long was under the Roman Empire, nearly 2000 years ago (and the 19th century doesn't count because, for example, Prussia-Austria vs. Denmark, ""Germany"" vs. France). So you have to excuse a few of us to make the mistake of projecting this to areas of the world that aren't as lucky as we are. In the end, however, saying that this continent has become far more civilised than it was in the past is no Europhilic delusion, it's a simple historical truth."

>Because you were claiming that other gods don't matter. If gods are real and the religions that worship them are correct, then it follows that they do matter an awful lot. Creation myths on their own don't matter, but they're presented as foundations for why people believe in their gods. They set the scene for the story about what we're supposed to do, according to those gods.

I don't presume that all other gods are false. That doesn't mean I assume that all religions are necessarily true. Obviously someone following the Abrahamic god is probably doing it ""wrong,"" considering how narrow the path allegedly is and how broad the spectrum of followers is by comparison. You keep making these extreme presumptions. First it was that I don't reject all gods and you assumed I immediately accept all gods as real, then I clarify that and you assume I accept all religions as true. 

>I get pretty good results without believing in any gods. 

Good for you. Not relevant to me.

>Lots of Christians get good results from believing in their god. Lots of Muslims can claim the same. So can Hindus and Asatru and Buddhists and Jainists and so forth.

Good for them. Not relevant to me, save the ""Asatru"" part to an extent. The difference is that as you go down that list and leave behind the Abrahamic faiths you get into religions that don't claim they have the ""one true path."" The Abrahamic religions are relatively unique in just how much they conflict with other belief systems, which is why I object to questions directed at all ""believers"" but only poignant to that group.

>Faith sounds pretty powerful. How far do you take it? Do you look both ways before crossing the street? Do you look at what you're about to eat before you bite into it?

I guess I'm an idiot, but I need you to explain to me what those questions have to do with faith. Best I can gather you think I view ""faith"" as some sort of divine protection such that I never have to worry about anything bad happening, which is patently not the case.

>If a doctor's prescription isn't working, do you talk to the doctor about why or do you take it on faith that it's going to work sooner or later?

I talk to the doctor. Just because one takes a small step beyond pure empiricism doesn't mean they're a lunatic or that they question nothing.

>Furthermore, why would you not get the same results from faith in Hindu gods rather than your own?

They're tied to a culture I don't begin to understand. If I immersed myself in it and followed that path, I might (and I'd even say probably would) get the same results. But the culture that accompanies my beliefs comes a lot more naturally, so that's what I go with. Not to make light of it, but it's like asking why I prefer a cheeseburger to thai food. Both will satisfy hunger, but I'm only going to really enjoy the former. 

> I think we've safely established by this point that my questions are still relevant to polytheists.

I don't think we have. Your entire premise is based on exclusivity claims that few (if any) non-monotheist beliefs tend to hold.

>When you have religions that claim to be the One True Faith and all others are deceptions created by the Divine Adversary, you most certainly have religions that invalidate each other. If Islam is true then your beliefs most certainly cannot be true.

That doesn't mean I have to place any stock in Islam. It doesn't even mean I have to reject the existence of their god. Their god is ostensibly the same one the Jews worship, they just have a different interpretation of how properly to follow him. I don't find any great conflict with Judaism and my beliefs, in the sense that one must invalidate the other. As such I don't reject the YHWH that told the jews to place no other god before him. I only reject Christianity and Islam's universalist offshoots. 

Again, I refer back to your original question. It's about gods invalidating one another. Not about religions doing so. That's a whole separate conversation, in which I will happily admit I regard Christianity and Islam to be entirely full of it.

>Or who are so obsessed with men being falsely charged for rape that they pretty much don't care that lots and lots of women are raped?

There is nothing scarier than the thought of being falsely accused of rape and having no leg to stand on.

>After having a look at the planned pipeline(can't find the source at the moment. It showed up a few months ago. Not the roadmap.) I would have to disagree. It looks like much more traditional gamedev than alpha being used as a ""buzzword"". I believe it was Brian Hicks that gave a clear outline as to the dev cycle, with condensed alpha and beta periods.

That's a valid opinion but I don't share it. Traditional game dev doesn't involve either early access, open alphas, or whatever you want to call what this is. This is a fairly recent trend in game dev. Alphas traditionally are internal and closed, then there are both open and closed betas depending on what the studio wants, and then release in my expereince.

>Alpha is the initial implementation of all the key features and mechanics for the game, and beta is when the majority of the polish, bug fixing, and fine tuning comes into play.

Yes. This is what I'm saying. I feel like they're neglecting key features at the moment. Alphas should be a functional implementation of all key features. This is also sometimes referred to as a ""vertical slice"". An example of each feature of the game is present and working, you may not have all variations of it in place but the functionality is there.

>During alpha, bug fixing is not a priority.

This may be how your studio does it, it may be how Bohemia does it, but this has not been my experience. I've worked with small indie developers literally working out of their homes and large studios in Microsoft's Redmond offices. In all the places I've had the pleasure of working, alpha was always used as the period where you make sure the game is not broken. Beta was to stress test it and work out anything new or anything that was missed in Alpha.

>Of course, different studios follow different cycles, but this seems to be the cycle that Bohemia Interactive seems to be following.

>Women get friendzoned because they lack the necessary value for the man in question to return her emotional investment.

Holy crap, ""lack the necessary value""? Do you not see how this comes across? You sound like you're talking about a racehorse, or an antique, or some other object that is beneath him instead of a human being who is, in fact, his equal. FFS, man. You aren't doing much to make yourself seem like you're not a misogynist right now.

>Women don't understand themselves/their own attraction/biological triggers 

I guess we need you big, strong, extra-smart menz to come along and educate us about ourselves. I guess men understand women better than women understand themselves. giggle

Give me a break. If you really believe this, then there is probably no point talking with you any further because you have evidently gotten your mind so wrapped up in your personal opinion of Womanhood that you can't see women realistically at all. You continue to speak of us as if we're a string of paper dolls instead of individuals, and it's really sexist. In my experience speaking with sexist people, they are generally not very good at forming logical opinions and giving coherent advice where the opposite sex is concerned, because all they can see is their own prejudice - they substitute reality with their ideology and refuse to see anything but that. And it warps and twists the mind until it is tied up in so many knots that they can no longer think clearly. 

>Furthermore, psychologically, women tend to not like the idea that men they're very attracted too are often doucheknobs, so I'm sure there's a level of cognitive dissonance there,

This is an issue of maturity, not of ""femaleness"". Many young women tend to lack the wisdom not to date morons, which is why the quiet geeky guy who's smart and loyal but not gorgeous gets passed over for the football player who's hot but cheats on his girlfriends and beats up weaker guys for kicks. Not all do this; there are a lot of girls/women who don't chase the players or date the douchecanoes. If it weren't for the fact that a lot of young men are just as ridiculous about dating, you might have a leg to stand on, but given that the guys go crazy for the hot girls, the flirty girls, and even the spoiled princess girls who walk all over their boyfriends, and ignore the plain but awesome girls, clearly this is an issue of maturity and not gender. Most people grow out of it. They sow their wild oats when they're young, but as they mature into their late 20s/early 30s, they tire of it and decide that it's time to settle down and look for something deeper, with someone who is worth it instead of with the knobs they used to date. Men and women both do this.

>Hell, our own mothers teach us this crap. Just be yourself son...if they don't like you, then screw them! Just be nice! Blah blah blah.

What should we teach our sons, then? Be fake? Pretend to be someone you aren't so people will like you and girls will notice? Be a douchebag who treats women like objects, because even though it'll be empty and superficial at least you'll be scoring some sweet, sweet tail? 

>I didn't; you straw man'ed that,

You said that friendzoning is perpetuated by women. The person or group who perpetuates something is responsible for that thing and for the fallout it causes. 

>but as you are a woman, I would never except you to agree that your gender is responsible for a wrong doing,

Um...I'm a woman, not a child. I'm fully capable of admitting when I make a mistake, and I'm not so blind as to think that women as a whole are innocent as a lamb either. But I don't think that there are many things in life so black and white that you can pin all or even almost all of the blame on one gender or the other. You seem to see this issue in mostly black and white, but I see it in shades of grey. It's not as simple as you are making it out to be. 

And I have to wonder if you really read what I wrote. I readily agreed that yes, there are women who deliberately do this to men. But I pointed out that there are others who don't even realize the man feels friendzoned by her actions, and you seem to have either skipped that part or ignored it. Whatever.

>Although, you go about in a different way than most of the lady posters on Reddit.

The durability of african genes is amazing due to what it can do in more ways than one. Henrietta Lacks is the most well known contributer of this, but there are more like her that I can name in the drop of a dime.

>If black society wasn't such a mess people might take you more seriously

Which black societies are a mess? The ones created by whites after killing every prosperous black city within American borders (and killing hundreds of wealthy black American citizens)? The ones that we now known were being intentionally destroyed by the American government all the way up to the 1980's through mass incarceration? Or just the African nations destroyed by whites to steal their resources and make them more economically dependent? Clinton's emails says hello. We can talk about either. Let us not forget, a few decades ago, the american dream didn't apply to black people. When you worked hard, saved money, accumulated wealth, they dropped bombs on you. I am not joking. This was a thing.

I disagree that most people are walking stereotypes that need to be schooled by some academic-type about who they really are. That's actually a very condescending perspective to have of other people. By saying things like this, you are guilty of exactly the thing you claim to be fighting---the total eraser of nuance in each individual that means they are not stereotypes. And proving my point that you're argument for gender fluidity only reinforces the existence and legitimacy of these stereotypes. You are literally arguing for their legitimacy right now when you say most people are stereotypical and would supposedly remain to be stereotypical without your intervention.

If someday, someone come and say ""you are racist, the way you act because of your education and the society you are in is bad and hurtful"", maybe you won't change, but at least you can start to interrogate yourself ""Am I acting bad ? Why is it bad ?"".

This analogy does not work with the argument that you are making. Your argument is that most people are stereotypical of their gender and that by calling yourself genderfluid and bringing gender to greater attention, it allows people to rethink their behavior. Your analogy here would only work if you were actually claiming that black people are stereotypically subhuman and that we need to talk about racism in order to bring their subhumanism to attention so that they can rethink they're behavior.

Averaging over the whole country is very common, so is averaging to the smallest unit possible, i.e. actual visible borders.

What isn't common is taking an arbitrary mid-point, especially in such a heated topic.

This cut-off point is arbitrarily picked by you to fulfill your very obvious pro-Russian agenda.

>10% is a reasonable cut-off point for recent minorities. 

10% would be reasonable, but not as a harsh cut-off point. It makes it look like these areas have a significant minority, while the areas neighbouring them have none. Both are incorrect.

> As does every statistical map ever. 

Yet only yours strongly coincides with Kremlin agenda.

>The map is based on purely geographical criteria because—using the symbols according to their resolution—because, as you rightly noted, that is the point of the map. 

Your cut-off point is too stark, arbitrary, and the symbol you use is too large - all together creating a strong cut-off of strongly mixed areas in arbitrary locations.

>However, if it creates a correct impression of the overall size if the minority, that's an added bonus.

This is a sickening understanding. Your map intentionally creates a larger Russian area than there really is. Notice I used the word ""area"", not ""absolute numbers"". A map is about areas, not absolute numbers, it's ridiculous that a map-maker doesn't understand this...

A map is not supposed to be a proportional representation of absolute numbers... You are thinking of a cartogram! And you still haven't addressed this issue! You are mixing up the purpose of a map and a cartogram! This alone is a very clear indicator that you have a very obvious agenda to push!

They weren't at the wrong place at the wrong time. They were always at the wrong place! They had no right to settle to Estonia.

> I've loved past AHS players like Angela and Adina and Gabourey not because of their melanin, but because they're phenomenal actresses who play their parts incredibly well. 

And there are other nonwhites who are phenomenal actors but they don't get the roles and their talent has to be questioned by people who say they like nonwhite actors not thanks to their melanin. Does anyone ever say they like white actors,not because of their skin tone? No, because people give white actors the benefit of the doubt that they get roles because of talent, while nonwhite actors are treated like diversity hires by racists.

>You also have to understand that the US is over 2/3rds white and that the AHS audience is even whiter than that, so obviously white characters are going to be involved.

Because you're obviously against casting nonwhites as the leads of cult, when nonwhite characters very well should have been the leads on a season about Trump and his racist cult.

I'm now convinced you don't know the definition of faith. A person has faith other people are honest, just like a person has faith that a person is eating a sandwich on the other side of the planet. Nobody makes micro calculations at any given time because that's not how the mind works and just because it's a verifiable phenomenon doesn't mean you actually have to verify it to believe it. That there is an origin is not an extraordinary claim. We can take by faith that we have an origin and a creator.

Let's not start playing a word game. You know very well that when I'm talking about life, I mean outside of our own.

>I wouldn't feel safe saying, ""Yes, there definitely is life.""

So no, we can't say there is. If you find fox tracks in the snow, then there is probably a fox in the area. If you find hares, that doesn't mean there are foxes around to hunt them. We have not found any ""alien tracts"". If you try to contact aliens, you do it with the faith that there is a communicative species out there, because that is a belief not based on evidence.

>Then tell me this. What is faith based on?

Not on evidence. That is it's definition. It doesn't mean the belief is not warranted, simply that it's not based on reproducible evidence.

>No, I said that things weren't ""created"" by an agent.

To be honest, this is a misunderstanding that happened because I used a weird word for origin (creator) to make my point better. Now I hope it's clear how I use the word creator.

>How do you know this? ""Nothing"", as in philosophical ""nothing,"" doesn't exist, and we've never seen it.

Spare me the pseudo-intellectual bull. When I said ""nothing comes from nothing"" I obviously meant everything has an origin, as I had said before. To say it in the sense of ""The Nothing"" makes no sense for the context.

>Look, I have a degree in philosophy. This doesn't work on me.

That's a nice condescending tone you have there.

Anyway: to argue that the circumstances are natural or supernatural is of no concern to me, as I only need a creator, which we certainly have. The reason why I didn't want to go into the reasons why it loves us, is because it's a lot of little thoughts (among which is ""creators generally love what they create"") that add up and I didn't feel like arguing all of them with you. I honestly didn't mean for this to drag on so much.

Of course for this reason I haven't adequately proven there is a creator and he does love us, but that wasn't the point either. The point was that it was a reasonable view to hold."

">It's just hilarious to read comments on reddit where people assume if you invest money you automatically get a return on it

Don't be so condescending based on a false assumption. I understand the basics of investment.

If you get a positive return, it's a positive return regardless of the tax rate. Reward changes, but not risk (at least not directly, in a substantial way).

If I'm sitting on some capital and looking for a way to invest it, I'm going to put it where I think it's going to give me the greatest return. If the tax rate was 30% instead of 15% does that change my decision on where I think I'll get the greatest return? I would say ""no"", but if you disagree, please say how. 

Yes, a marginal change in tax rate is going to cause a diversified portfolio to shift allocations, just like any other change in input parameters. It's not going to make me go, ""Fuck it!"" and put all my money under a fucking a mattress. Do you think a marginal difference in tax rate is going make me decide against investing at all? Why?"

">I think if you get upset about video games that you write ""fuck it all to hell"", then you probably need to get some perspective.

That is all correct as long as the tone that you applied to the post is accurate.

My entire point is that you're completely misconstruing tone based on the actual context.

The only real evidence showing he is super upset is harsh language, but people use harsh language to talk about something they don't like without being super upset constantly.

Bbased on context, rationality, and a dash of Occam's Razor, it seems far more likely that this was meant to be delivered in a calmly stated way in order to juxtapose the calmness of tone with the harsh language to express mild frustration.

Couple that with the fact that it was just the language and no diatribe about the actual problems, and we see that the person has no intention or need to delve into any actual issues with the game, furthering the idea that this is meant as a general message about online, not about his actual contempt for anything.

So, besides the word ""fuck"", can you tell me why you think he's upset enough to need you to give him life advice?

">You say being fat isn't a death sentence but you make fat shaming sound like one, and put the most severe implications on it onto a daily basis. You can be mean to the wrong person on the wrong day, or nice to the wrong person on the wrong day and they could still kill themselves.

The difference being whether you perhaps contribute to their decision to off themselves, self harm, eat more, or withdraw into themselves.

Just because you weren't the sole reason that a person was mentally damaged doesn't mean that you're not responsible if you actively contributed.

>What made them do it is the accumulation of abuse that the person has taken, which in my opinion is not fat shaming.

The accumulation of abuse can oftentimes just be a bunch of different ignorant unempathetic assholes shaming someone for being fat. You also need to keep in mind that this is an issue that is wide-reaching in our society, and you're probably not the only person bearing down on these people.

There's quite a difference between a close friend pulling you aside and having a talk about your health out of concern, and a bunch of strangers at random points in the day attacking you and making you feel horrible.

>I don't pretend to be a messiah, I don't pretend to be a doctor, I shame an unhealthy lifestyle.

And what do you hope to accomplish with that? Society makes these people feel ashamed every single day of their lives.

You, and many, many, many other people on this site and in real life has this misconception that ""fat acceptance"" is about being okay with your weight. It's not. Weight thresholds are unhealthy, it's a fact. What it is about is being okay in your own skin, being okay with yourself as a person, not being defined as a human being by your weight.

Shaming more often than not in cases of weight issues will cause comfort eating and/or mental damage.

>I've already said in this thread that you can shame fat without targeting an individual. You just keep describing bullied victims that don't deserve what happened to them.

Nowhere do you say this, and even make statements such as:

>You have to have something to motivate them more than food or drugs. Sometimes shame is the only option.

""Them"" being the operative word here, as it's referring to people. In this context I would imply that this is meant as a strategy when encountering overweight people.

Eitherway, I don't think you understand. What makes you different than someone who attacks individuals?

Definition of Shame: a painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the consciousness of wrong or foolish behavior.

Whether you do it to one person or a group, shame is a way to inflict pain. Nevermind to assume that they're not conscious of their weight is pure idiocy on your part, and a gross display of narcissism.

>No but you have an idea what someone health is like if they are very overweight or obese, and like I already said I don't agree with targeting individuals.

Actually, you don't. I bet the person who you're condescending to does, though. You completely ignore half my points, probably because you can't form a counterargument to them. Inferring that someone doesn't understand their own weight is basically assuming they're a moron or in denial. And let me tell you something about denial - no random stranger is going to tackle that beast, and it isn't confined to weight issues in the least.

I knew of a young woman who went to my college and had an athletic build. Through overhearing from some of her friends I learned she'd been diagnosed with brain cancer. Her health deteriorated rapidly, and some type of brain damage took place that made her weight increase rapidly. She went from being a sporty athletic lean woman to a scooterbound fairly large woman by the end of the semester.

My point being not that every case is like that. It's a very rare situation I'm sure. But the point is that taking a glance at someone generally reveals very little, and although you're free to develop an opinion or judgment - keep it to yourself till you know their whole story."

My entire compensation for Don's Plum as a writer, producer, and actor was $180 which I received nearly six years after we shot the film.

> Money wasn't taken out of anyone's pocket and you do yourself a disservice by pushing that victim narrative so hard.

Literally millions of dollars were taken out of the pockets of the entire cast and crew. My personal loss likely exceeds a million dollars. I'm pissed about that.

> I'm sure you know very well that Hollywood vaults movies all the fucking time.

Correct, an owner of a film can decide not to distribute their film. In this case, DiCaprio and Maguire did not own the film yet they tried to stop it from being distributed. They only succeeded in blocking the film in the US and Canada.

> And I'm sure you know the showbiz adage that ""You're only as good as your last show"". DiCaprio was gearing up to be an enormous star, and Maquire pretty big himself. They or their production company looked at Don's Plum and decided ""You know... this isn't the one. This isn't the thing that we want pushing us into the next project.""

None of this is accurate in terms of what actually happened, but let me just point out that what you're saying is that two people who agreed to be in a movie with dozens of other actors and artists changed their minds for whatever reason, and their careers and their right to financially prosper for their work takes precedence over everyone else's. This is serious problem in this country.

> So, they decided to take it off their market.

Which was illegal and highly unethical.

> That's the right of the people with the money.

Crazy.

> The moment you signed their contract and took their money, it stopped being your movie and started being their movie.

Crazy. If you're think when you write ""their"" that Leo and Tobey owned the work, or that they financed the film, you would be wrong on both counts. David Stutman held the majority of ownership of the film, although we were all shareholders. So Stutman had (has) a fiduciary responsibility to us all. On April 1, 1998 Leo and Tobey were sued by David Stutman for blocking his (our) movie. I fully supported David's decision to sue these men.

> It isn't like you had Harvey Weinstein knocking down your door, right?

Actually, Harvey Weinstein offered us 1 million dollars for Don's Plum. After the dispute broke out, Leo's Manager Rick Yorn called Miramax and told them that if they went ahead with the acquisition there would be ""certain consequences"" for their actions. This was told to Premiere Magazine by the Miramax executive who spoke with Yorn.

> Your biggest mistake with Don's Plum is that you failed, and continue to fail, to accurately evaluate the value of that film.

OK...

> In case you hadn't heard; Diner's been done. You're film has none of the watchability of Tarantino and none of the challenge of Von Trier.

OK... oh and by the way, Lars Von Trier's company Zentropa purchased Don's Plum after the settlement. Let me grab a quote from his partner, one of the most successful producers in Europe, a quote he gave at the Don's Plum's press conference at the Berlin Film Festival in 2001:

""We from Europe had to save an American film from the worst kind of American imperialism: the studio system... the star system that was going to kill these two guys. These Nationalists used every fucking power play to squeeze these young guys that made a film together with their friends. So that's a disgrace really, for the business of America that treats young artists like that."" Producer, Zentropa Films, Peter Aalbaek Jensen

Cool quote, right?

> You weren't making art.

Incorrect.

> You were making a commercial product.

Correct.

> It isn't that I don't understand why you'd want to push to get this film out. This isn't the first time you did it. This was a news item back around 99 too, if I recall correctly.

Yes. I want our film released.

> You've spent 20 years stuck in this one thing. What else have you done?

I was blacklisted. Let's just say my stuff has been in development a long time.

> I'm sure finding options is an increasingly hard thing for you to do.

Yes.

> But the moment you stopped playing ball, you soured yourself with two of the biggest stars in Hollywood and by virtue of that everyone connected to them by at least 3 degrees.

Which is why blacklisting is so effective. I've been trying to raise some money in the South recently and I got a shot to pitch a billionaire who made his fortune in booze. I was asked by a liaison, in plain english, to join the ""white boys club"" and financing my film would be done in a snap. I did not join that club either.

> For a kinda meh film.

Thank you for your thoughtful review.

> What do you think is going to happen here?

Let me tell you what I didn't think would happen... I didn't think that Leo would block the film. I did not think he was capable of that absolutely unthinkable act from one artist to do to another (make that dozens).

> The movie comes out.

Yes. 

> A bunch of people watch it.

Yes!

Don't care.

That would be nice. I worked very hard for it.

"> A lot of people (read: women) don't seem to understand what a cat call is. Generally I've also noticed a corrolation between women who get offended by cat calls and them generally being at least a bit narcissistic.

Oh fuck off. This is the most horrible pile of stupid condescending wank I've read today.

It doesn't matter why they do it, it's obnoxious, and it makes women feel uncomfortable, or even scared. Unsolicited comments about their bodies, and regarding whether some dipshit on the street wants to fuck them, are not okay, and it doesn't take a narcissist to be upset by them. Women just want to be able to walk around without being sexualised and harassed, and without being reminded that so many people have so little respect for them, and only consider their worth as a person to be how they look.

What on Earth is wrong with you that you think the people most in need of criticism in this situation are the women? You're telling people who are being harassed to shut up and put up with it. That they 'lose' if they do anything to try to stop it, or to let men know that it's not okay. Fuck that. You are most definitely a part of the problem.

Besides, you are absolutely wrong about why people cat call. If it were just to get a reaction then men wouldn't so routinely get angry and call women bitches for not responding positively. And it wouldn't be such an overwhelmingly common, and utterly sincere, defence that 'it's just a compliment' and women shouldn't get upset about that. Or that women must want to be catcalled, else they wouldn't dress so 'provocatively'.

People catcall because they feel they are entitled to attention from women, and have a right to demand it. They do it because it makes them feel good to assert dominance and control, to remind women that public spaces belong to men and that women are there for men to appreciate. They do it because they legitimately feel that a woman's sense of her own value should be dependent on what they think of her."

">But by all means, let's completely disregard what I just said and downvote me

You're being downvoted because your pedantic argument about lag isn't contributing anything constructive to a thread about priotising netcode and connection quality in the support-phase of this game's lifecycle.

>because this sub is loaded with non-technical twitter kids.

You should try to avoid being condescending when your own post is neither relevant nor technical in any way.

Now as for the actual message you were trying to convey: latency-free games do not exist, we all have latency, but when it's more noticable - it's a problem on your end, not the game or server hosting the match.

It's a dismissive, condescending fallacy, based purely on your anecdotal evidence. It's basically saying ""I have zero problems, so it must be your own doing."" Fuck no, and fuck that comment for it's zero-contributing assholery in a thread that validly calls for support on a known, proven and perpetually existing issue: overbearing and convoluted netcode that prioritises the wrong things to decide how confrontations between players turn out.

But to not be dismissive, I'll address your comment:

True, all games will have latency. It's a mechanical reality of playing a networked game. Packages have to travel to and from players, this takes time, hence latency. Nobody is asking for zero ping games, so why you mention this is beyond me. 

Now, how the host or server and client process this latency in the game, that is netcode. And it most definitely plays a major role in how noticabel latency can be.

Netcode basically does the following: on the server/host end it rewinds and predicts game information to sync up differences in ping, and as such, actions in the game, from client to client, in order to create a true state of the game to send back to each player. It does this continuously throughout a game, in predefined intervals of time - milliseconds mind you, so it's nearly real-time.

Since BO1, Treyarch have made a big change to netcode. See, before them, CoD's netcode would ""simply"" state the host's game-state as zero-ping, and rewind all players to the host's gamestate.

This did two things: it made the host god, and it made the netcode lean and quick, making for very clean and accurate hit detection if your ping was low, and fucked hit detection if your ping was high.

Basically, it was a fair and honest way of prioritising pingtime as the parameter of who was ""right"" in a gunfight between two players with different latency; the one with the lower ping. It did more than this to balance small differences, but this was basically what it came down to.

Treyarch (and probably Activision) decided the playerbase of CoD consisted of too many players that had mediocre connections, and prioritizing ping in the netcode would mean the guys with the better/more expensive ISP would dominate, deferring a big portion of the playerbase to keep playing. So they changed the netcode to account for this: they added artificial latency to all connections in a lobby.

To this day, this is how CoD's netcode works. It adds ping to ALL players, and rewinds back depending on each individual player's latency. 

When you hear players playing on a crowded wifi saying ""I don't notice anything..."", while guys on 90/90 fiber connections, living two blocks from a giant backbone, complain about constantly suffering from spotty, latent hit detection - that's the result of the netcode prioritizing the bigger latency player's game-state over the lower one.

And that, kids, is why this thread is the seventeen hundredth lag comp complain thread that's been posted on this topic. Because the netcode is illogical and unfair, and leads to RNG-like gameplay, where gunfights are almost arbitrarily decided by who has just the perfect amount of latency to make the netcode work in it's favor.

It's bullshit, and threads like these call for a change, and comments like yours only serve to undermine the validity of the complaint.

">You'll note that he never expresses any of this to Clark. He's learned his lesson from his villains and he keeps the villain monologue short, and here's what he says...........It was only because Superman showed up that the day was saved. So Batman did what we all do and rationalized and made excuses and focused his hate until

I'm not quite sure what you're taking about when you say Black Zero but I'm gonna infer from the context your talking about Zod and his Cronies. In that scene I actually interpreted something slightly different, I think Bruce saw and unnecessary and alien conflict that didn't need to occur happening above him and the destruction it was causing to humanity. In this sense Bruce is actually kind of right, Superman didn't save the day in Man of Steel, the conflict in Man of Steel arises because of Clark's existence and presence on Earth. Bruce believes Clarke to be a threat that endangers humanity. As I mention before there are three instances where we can see Clark's presence damming humanity, he led directly to the arrival of Zod, he led directly to the creation of Doomsday, and he leads to the dark future we see. Superman doesn't solve any problems in this movie that are human in origin, all the problems that occur are extensions of himself. The DKR quote is more of a reinforcement of the nihilist ideas we've seen Bruce expressing throughout this film, he doesn't see Clark as having a divine purpose, Clark's presence isn't heralding something good for humanity, instead to Bruce it's a danger that needs to be curbed before it can cause anymore harm to people who can't fight back against it.

>You mean until he flashes back to the moment where his own father's last thought in this mortal plane was for his wife? As he prepares to deal the killing blow to this man that he knows, on some level, is a good person trying to do the right thing? And he sees this person, this alien freak call out a woman's name, knowing it's the last thing he'll ever say. Just like his father, so many years ago.
And then bam it's that Pulitzer winner from that newspaper! ""It's his mother's name! It's his mom, homie, chill!!"" and oh my god it all comes together. That little millennial piece of shit Lex Luthor kidnapped this dork's mom (he has a mom? a girlfriend??) forced him to come fight (oh my god he even said ""Lex wants us fight"" how fucking stupid am I?!) and is probably using us as a distraction for something else. He must have been behind the Senate bombing so I can't even imagine what he's up to now oh Jesus oh Christ we need to do something get up, dork!!
That entire scene makes perfect sense to me, and if you want to twist facts to make it about the sheer coincidence of their mothers both having the same name, I can't stop you, but it doesn't change the narrative's sequence of events. Sorry.

Bruce up until that point shows no qualms killing a man he understands is trying to do good, he believes its for a justifiable cause. He understands that Clark has parents, probably parents from earth too considering an earlier conversation he has with Alfred and the quote he says earlier from the TDKR. The thing that stops him is the callback to his mother, hence the flashback to her.

>You and I have very different definitions of slaughter. Let's go over this scene again: he approaches a band of elite mercenaries who are using military-grade weaponry in an urban environment. One of them fires at him with a powerful minigun, so he takes a second-- taking fire-- lines up his shot-- still taking fire-- begins to shoot at the ground in front of the merc-- still taking fire-- crawls his fire toward the merchant, giving him plenty of time to just jump out and run away-- still taking fire-- and then finally blows the truck up underneath him. Explain to me what Batman did that was morally wrong. Would a cop or a soldier have been wrong to ""slaughter"" this man in that way? Then, Batman enters a room with ""two dozen [armed] hostiles"" without even a gun. Yeah, he probably killed a couple of them (looking at you, crate guy whose head magically starts gushing blood in the Ultimate Edition), but they got off easy. SWAT or, hell, the Punisher would have just fucking killed everyone. Batman literally showed them mercy by merely putting most of them in the hospital. And yeah, maybe he was cruel for eye-for-an-eye'ing the guy that stabbed him (poor criminal mercenary ) but he sure did mess up that perfect Bruce Wayne blood sample that guy had just created. Then he shoots the tank of the flamethrower a guy was about to use to cook a Midwestern mom alive with.

Hospitalization? Batman causes an explosion that blows up that entire floor of the building, he takes a man's skull and smashes it into the floor. Batman is not morally wrong but his methodology is in a sense not incredibly heroic. Considering the alternative option was to have superman just fly in, pick up his mom and take her to safety, it can also be argued it's unnecessary. Also again you're taking something out of context, I don't care if Bruce kills them all or not. I'm saying we can see the character doesn't make a certain revelation in the aforementioned scene with Clarke because his methodology and attitude towards killing don't regress to what they were implied to be before the events of the movie(and man of steel technically) occurred. 

>One more thing:This is irrelevant because Clark has destructive capabilities and powers that need to be checked no matter what.It's, um, really weird that you seem to have taken this to heart. No wonder you didn't like this movie, because you don't seem to like Superman very much. To each his own, I guess.""

There's no reason to be a condescending asshole in your post, I in no way straw manned or personally attacked you so extending the same respect would be nice. Don't take a quote from my post out of context and try to respond to it like that's an opinion I'm expressing, I'm clearly talking about Bruce's attitude he reiterated towards Superman during the movie which is supported by the increasingly ruthless measures he takes to counter crime in Gotham.

I've read every single Superman graphic novel and have enjoyed previous renditions of the character, I'm sorry I disliked the vision of Superman created by a guy who supports a political ideology that on a fundamental level vilifies the concept of an ubermensch. Still my dislike for the movie or a dislike for the character was not what was being expressed in what you quoted so, don't be an idiot. 

Also because I don't want to talk about this anymore with you since you're pretty much deeply rooted in your self-hugbox, here's a direct quote from Zack Snyder about this very scene:

>You know, they're both born and live in a world where someone can care about them and mourn them, and they can love their mother. And that's the cool thing, you know we spend so much time with the Martha-Clark relationship that I think it kind of pays off there. You realize, oh, we needed that as viewers, so we could get to a moment with Batman where that moment with Martha resonates. Because we've lived on with Clark's relationship with his mother, so that moment is like, ""Wow, that's ringing for me and I feel it.""

The man who partially wrote and directed the movie says its about their mothers, the end. If I need to analyze and pick apart the quote for you to get what he's talking about you may just be a lost cause.

So true. But the probability of experiencing counterfeit parts (1) decreases with age and (2) decreases when parts are purchased in bulk and withstand the test of actually being put into products. I wonder what kind of QA a counterfeiter uses when using counterfeited parts? Yeah, that's what I thought.

I haven't purchased a new piece of ham radio equipment in years. So I don't pay that R&D premium you're talking about. My money goes into the hands of another ham, who probably then turns around and does the same thing. In turn, when I'm done with a piece of equipment I'll do the same. So I might not vote out politicians that support breaks for Chinese importers, but I do my part by not paying the R&D premium.

You obviously have elected yourself as the maker of these sorts of decisions. The only problem with that is your opinion means nothing as it relates to law and access to reproductive healthcare. Your belief on this relies on assumptions made about the moral character of the female - not only is that problematic from a logical point of view, I would argue it's both immoral and unethical.

First of all; I think a relationship shouldn't be ""a challenge to confront my prejudices"" Especially when taking that challenge might leave me infected with a very serious, life long disease.

>I see your situation, and I see so much of myself in what was going through your mind, and then I saw what you did with those thoughts and feelings, and instead of feeling relief that I don't have to rise above my own selfishness, I realized that I would never want to hurt someone like you did.

Your not so sublte dig at the other users who agree with me it's very extra. Taking care of myself its not selfishness, its common sense. Would you smoke a pack a day if you wanted to avoid cancer? Would you eat 10000 kcal if you wanted to avoid diabetes? Of course you wouldn't! Then; by the same logic you wouldn't sleep and date with HIV+ people if you want to avoid getting infected. Especially if you don't have access to prep.

>So I decided to look into what it is that you did and thought, and tried to figure out where things went wrong, and where you went wrong is when you treated him as his infection rather than as a human being. 

OK I'm gonna assume you didn't even read the OP. I told him I could be his friend and that he could talk to me whenever he needed it but he decided to be an ass, give me an ultimatum and put loud music to shut me up. I never said ""eww aids"" or shit like that. 

>You can either take that basic fact as a challenge to be more than what you are now, or you can scream that I'm mean and just don't get you. Our choices define our humanity, and yours failed you in this situation. Will you choose grow from this?

Okay now you need to get off your high horse and cut the condescending attitude. I should be more... what? More complacent? Should I walk on eggshells to not upset everybody and put some random Grindr guy's feeling above my health? Fuck that! It is true that our choices define our humanity but I literally don't know a more human trait than COMMON SENSE (and self preservation too).

Maybe you should take the opportunity to learn from this and give yourself a reality check. People don't wanna get sick, plain and simple. If you have HIV then some people might find you very attractive and get on prep for you, but the truth is that 99% won't and you can't blame them or try to shame/guilt them into it. Actually expecting the world and random people on the internet to risk their health to date you is way, WAY more selfish than just taking care of yourself."

For one, your comment was impolite in the first place however you intended it. And we don't have differing views on discussing fantasy novels, we have differing views on what it means to enjoy a book.

Because with the logic of what you said in that initial comment, it's stupid empathize with any character, and to feel any emotion at any turn of events.

The thing of it is, those topics were covered before the release of 4, and were part of the reason I paid for it. Not including it in 4 then trying to charge me again for 5 with the exact same promise is not cool, especially when the original excuse was ""we want people to have backwards compatibility with old game projects"" when they've got the old engine versions available for download.

Innocent / in¦no|cent

Adjective

Not guilty of a crime or offence: ""the prisoners were later found innocent"", ""he is innocent of Sir Thomas’s death.""

Her current status is not innocent. She has been found guilty in a court of law in a democratic country. You, and all your other little fuckwit jingoist oxygen thieves must accept it.

If she is innocent she must be freed with the correct procedure. You can't just swagger into the country in your gun belt and say ""Let her go, she's 'Murican!"".

If she is innocent, I hope she's freed in a proper, democratic way, so that she can live the rest of her life in peace.

Also, at this point, I feel it would be remiss of me to fail to bring up the thousands upon thousands of innocent people who are currently being beaten, raped and isolated daily in the American 'for profit' prison system.

But of course it was not as significant as Varimathras let on, even conjuring up that ""rule"" about never slaying another nathrezim.

They who?

Only the Forsaken knew about the nathrezim's defeat in Lordaeron and you can't deny that because there's no written source that states otherwise. All material we have show only the Forsaken witnessing said defeat, annihilating everyone else and then also not showing that other nations could have a means of knowing (i.e information technology) of what was going on in Lordaeron.

It's getting very tiring to rebut baseless assumption after baseless assumption.

They had no idea there was a difference between Scourge and Forsaken.

They had no means to know that.

No meta-knowledge.

No information technology.

If the Argent Dawn and the Scarlet Crusade (both were already up and working by then, according to Chronicle) had sent messages to the nations of Stormwind and Ironforge, Lordaeron could very well have been retaken.

The only reason the AD and the Crusade didn't contact Stormwind and Ironforge is because that would certainly bring about the demise of what was to become a playable faction.

Now if you tell me that you disagree that the Argent Dawn, together with the Scarlet Crusade and a few forces of Ironforge and Stormwind wouldn't defeat Sylvanas' forces and the remaining Scourge in the state that they were in between RoC/TFT and Vanilla, I would simply have to call you crazy.

>We've got the largest military in the world, by far. And Mr. Trump want's to expand that so we can fight 2 wars on two continents. This is the fallacy of the next war will be like the last war. 

1) Trump said that the increase in spending would come from cuts in waste and streamlining bureaucracy. According to the Pentagon's own report this year, they had $125 Billion in waste per year, on average, out of a budget of about $550 billion. Almost 1/4 of the budget was being wasted according to their own calculations. Several billion of that could absolutely be used to fulfill Mr. Trump's plan for the military:

Building an active Army of about 540,000
Building a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions
Building a Navy nearing 350 surface ships and submarines
Building an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft
A new ""state-of-the-art"" missile defense system

As for the two wars on two continents, I'm not sure I know what you're referring to. He wants us to beat ISIS, but other than that, what war has he called for? I have payed very close attention, and if he's proposed another, I have either somehow totally missed it, or it simply isn't true. 

I'm a firm believer in carrying the biggest stick. Call me crazy. Our military is massive, sure, but we could make it stronger and more efficient, without a doubt. We clearly have a lot of bureaucratic waste, we overpay by quite a bit for a lot of our defense contracts, and we have had people in charge historically who have been complicit in that waste, which either stems from incompetence, or from bribery (cushy jobs offered by private defense contractors after someone's retirement from the government is shockingly legal, and doubtlessly common). Being so strong that we can't be touched is why other countries don't ever, and have never, attempted to attack the US or invade American soil. We need to be mighty, though I can certainly see your budgetary concerns and I share them, to an extent. It did encourage me that he may actually make real changes when Trump lambasted the 4.2 billion dollar aircraft he was offered, and promised to bring that cost down. It's small, but it's a good sign moving forward. It also encouraged me that he subtly called for a total ban on the previously-described practice where military contractors hire government officials in exchange for contract agreements that are, to say the least, irresponsible. Strangely enough, I saw very little reporting on that, from either side. 

>But, my point is, Republicans always terrify you about the debt, it's a big number, and then go and blow the debt up with outrageous defense spending. Debt: 1) Military spending, and 2) Depressions, where the social safety net gets used a lot. ( Food Stamps ).

The war was costly and foolish and I didn't agree with it. But to say that ""republicans"" blew up the debt with a war is to ignore the level of democratic support for the war(s). As for Republicans starting costly and unnecessary wars; Vietnam, one of the worst conflicts we've ever involved ourselves in, was perpetrated under the Kennedy administration and escalated by LBJ (Democrat), although Nixon (R) did make continue to make it worse. Except then, it ended under Ford (Also R). If you look back through history, the war-years and perpetration of said wars are actually fairly even between democrats and republicans in the last 100 years. Both sides have been almost equally complicit in banging the endless war drum, although it's true that Democrats have waged slightly more defensive wars than Republicans, and slightly less offensive wars than Republicans. The endless war drum is a bipartisan effort, and Clinton would have continued to bang away just as her ""idol"" Kissinger did, destroying countries and their people with foolish and ruthless US interference, continuing to incite war with Russia and the Middle East. Trump, not Hillary, was the one during this election preaching anti-intervention policies and offering a hand to Russia, who it's high time we stopped trying to be so aggressive toward. In fact, the Russian people have been fearing a Clinton presidency for some time and were genuinely terrified that it would have led to war with the US. He literally told his own military leaders to prepare for inevitable war if the US were to elect Clinton. This wasn't just Putin, though, a good portion of Russia believed this, and Hillary's record with Russia almost certainly validated these fears, right down to her aggressive and reckless call for a no-fly zone over Syria, which would have undoubtedly escalated tensions on it's own. 

>So, in the future, you need to run on Reagan's motto: ""Trust but Verify"". If your going to be a Republican, verify everything they say. And soon, seriously, you won't be.

Oh, boy. Where to start? Totally not true, and just a bit condescending. There are Republican liars and there are Democrat liars, pretending it's unique, or far more prevalent for Republicans or conservatives, is untrue and condescending. This election has truly let the democrat capacity for false information and half-truths bathe in the sunlight, and it comes from democrat leaders and talking heads alike. The left lies about and sensationalizes all kinds of things all the time; gun control, the proliferation of overzealous or downright hilarious attitudes about social justice activism, the assertions being made against Bannon, Trump, and tons of other conservatives calling them, literally, Hitler-worshiping, white supremacist Nazis. The only person on the left sane enough to come out against this latest full-scale smear campaign against Bannon, who is admittedly not a nice person, was the eternal (and arguably lone) voice of reason on CNN, Anderson Cooper. How can this be OK at such a widespread level, to just call people such a nasty thing with no actual proof or evidence that wasn't completely debunked immediately? It's no better than the assertions that Obama was a Muslim terrorist, or that Hillary was complicit in a child sex ring operation. Yet for some reason, it is totally OK to say that Steve Bannon is a white supremacist without a doubt, especially on this sub of all places, and simply pointing out that it's unfounded can get you lambasted as a racist/white supremacist yourself.

 Outside of that, another recent example of leftist horseshit that I've debunked from following MY version of Reagan's rule, ""Don't trust until you verify""? The Carrier deal! Anyone who bothered to research the deal a bit more extensively would know that it was not at all a bad deal, yet we can see examples like 

This:  http 

or this:  http 

or this:  http 

or this:  http 
or:  http 
or:  http 

All of these share one thing in common; they present a good thing as if it's not only a scam, but a big one. So then you have to ask, ""what's the scam, here?"" There are only two answers the left has for this: - He didn't save enough jobs (ONLY 800, how dare he!) and he offered tax credit incentives. First of all, the tax credit incentives were $700,000 a year from the state over 10 years, literally chump change compared to the state's treasure chest of 25 billion (2015 figures), to save 800 people from losing their (in many cases) career-long jobs. Not only that, but he got Carrier to promise to invest twice that much money (16 million) in Indiana! This much is clear; he was attacked for this deal because he's Trump, and democrats can't stand that he's actually working (already, might I add) to fulfill his promises. I shouldn't even need to point out that Obama did almost the exact same thing to a Pennsylvania oil refinery in 2012, but offered $25 million in tax breaks to save ~1000 jobs. 

The third argument is a bit better, but still disingenuous; offering tax credits for jobs is a slippery slope that will encourage other companies to ""take advantage"" of Trump and his generosity. This, of course, is also just speculation; it wasn't a problem when Obama did it, in fact, dems didn't even question the move. I will believe this to be a problem when I see it become a problem; anything else is speculative and seems a bit like fear-mongering, maybe even like the left is reaching for any reasons they possibly can that this deal was a bad thing. 

Personally, it goes against traditional conservative principles to interfere in such a way, and I keep that in mind when I critique the deal for myself, but regardless of those totally separate reasons, I can't help but see the bullshitting from the left on this one. It's asinine. "

Which isn't ""extra"" - it's paying their share of two separate things. I see no reason why similarly situated tax payers should pay different rates. Further, it masks the true cost of government in a way that punishes low tax states.

The states are also more than welcome to lower their taxes so their most well off citizens don't end up with a higher tax bill.

> The high tax states do subsidize the low tax states anyway. If anything this is ungrateful red states biting the hand that feeds them.

This frankly sounds a little off the rails. Ungrateful red states biting the hands that feeds them? It comes across as extremely condescending and out of touch.

The reality is that the red states would very much like to end some of the programs that lead to this imbalance in the first place. I doubt the Republicans would start losing elections in these places if they eliminated or rolled back Medicaid. It's fundamentally disingenuous to expand Medicaid in a completely partisan vote with ""free federal money"" and then beat up on states that are getting more Medicaid money.

Next we can turn to the highway system, another big red state ""subsidy"". Do you really think they built I-80 so that people can easily travel from Rawlins, WY to Rock Springs, WY? Of course not, they built it so that wine can be shipped from California vineyards to NYC buyers, or so that the rest of the nation can buy the goods that pay the Longshoreman salaries. Shutting down the interstates would disrupt the CA economy in a major way.

We can finish up with military bases. Most people don't live near military bases or end up deriving their income from them. Most people have about as much stake in their state military base(s) as your average Californian has in the Mountain Warfare Training Center - which is to say, not that much."

">Now, if we follow the interpretation that fish people are simply a metaphor for immigrants, then the first revelation would appear to fall flat because it is spoiled early on in the passage I quoted.

Wrong it isn't a one to one analogy ('equate') nor is it the only thing the story is ""about"" ('simply') nor was anyone arguing that it was, but the idea of interracial marriage (+ interracial sex etc.) being horrible is totally true within the story--in your quote the ""horror"" of interracial marriage (inasmuch as it being stigmatic w/n the community) is introduced early on as a mundane thing, the horror is intensified when the Other the people of Innsmouth are mixing w. is revealed to be fishpeople and the horror is further intensified when the narrator is discovered they are a product of said horror that's been explored throughout the story. The terror isn't spoiled it is built upon. I think you're plainly wrong to disagree that the horror of interracial marriage isn't present in the story--the horror and actually the twist being used more than once by Lovecraft in other stories (though I couldn't name their titles because I read all of Lovecraft 2 years ago but there's one where a woman I think comes from apes or something).

Wrt. Lovecraft's racism you're probably right. It was my understanding reading something by Joshi a few years ago that Lovecraft was especially racist.

Begging the question, you literally ask a question that goes beyond the logical implications of 85's assertion: 'Explain: Of all the possible interpretations why do you think that would be the best one?' to 'I believe Innsmouth is about interracial marriage.' 'About' meaning almost always 'I think X is one of the things Y is about,' hardly ever 'I think Y is only about X.' Your 'best' seems to imply that 85's stated interpretation is the only one they think because they said in one sentence that they believe something about the text.

"> Alright I can't explain this any simpler. Seriously.

I understood your argument, but you have been talking like this and it is frustrating and comes across as condescending -- makes me want to discontinue this altogether. I believe I addressed that in my post, and communicated that this is not the only way to look at a contract; it is a top-down view, and it only works with knowledge of what the Yankees will do, or assumptions on FAs that could have been acquired. You can analyze contracts outside of that framework and they can be reasonable. For instance, your methodology requires assumptions and knowledge about comparisons of positions that only make sense after we know what the Yankees will do or would have done, which is a retrospective argument, and only really works when you analyze it after the entire postseason. If the Yankees signed Cano, they would not have pursued the same contracts; your argument assumes several specific signings and positional improvements, which is a fatalistic approach. At the end, it may not be an upgrade from Ellsbury to Gardner, as Ellsbury being signed improves the chances that Gardner is no longer on the team.

In this way, one can simply argue that, in the middle of a fluid roster midseason, every piece of the lineup is not position by position improvement, but simply assets for a cost. Following this reasoning, it is not only reasonable but obvious to compare Cano and Ellsbury, as in the middle of the offseason, they are just money for value, regardless of the position. That you believe that you have the ""most accurate"" version of comparison, I believe, is a little much; that's a pretty heft contention, and I think, is reasonably arguable at the very least.

Also, the Yankees are spending as if there is no cap this offseason. My examples were not to say that A-Rod was a good comparison, it was the elucidate that clubs have different motivations for signing contracts outside of straight on the field value. Even assuming the Yankees are staying below the cap, my point is still very relevant."

"> it's ancient technology

So what? It does its job perfectly well:

 It transmits two channels of audio (which is more than plenty for the vast majority of phone situations) and receives one (again, more than plenty for phone situations) in a 3.5mm (or smaller!) form factor that's significantly thinner (albeit longer) than even Lightning
 Not only is it ""reversible"" (like Lightning or USB Type-C), but the plug can be freely rotated within the port, thus significantly reducing the chance of breakage in real-world use
 Most headphones/headsets using said port don't require an additional power source
 It's already analog, which removes at least one of the two digital-analog conversions required for non-analog audio transmission
 It's universally cross-platform, DRM-free, vendor-lock-in-free, and all the other things that the average Bitcoiner tends to prefer (since those are traits of their presumably-favorite electronic currency)

In other words, if it ain't broke, why fix it?

> It's a waste of space.

Again: so what? Who cares if a phone is a few micrometers thinner? I'd rather keep the existing thickness (or, better yet, make it thicker) and shove in more battery, since battery life is the single biggest problem with modern smartphones (especially compared to their dumbphone predecessors, which I've seen last for days or even weeks on a single charge; hell, I had one spontaneously wake up and start sounding an alarm after months of sitting in a drawer).

>Let me list a bunch of pointless exceptions in the English language.

You conveniently forgot to include an exception to the rule that the prefix ""a-"" implies negation of the original word.

Which, by the way, fully applies to words ending in ""ism"" as well. The root word of ""atheism"" is ""theism"". ""Atheism"" being the negation of ""theism"", or ""not theism"". Regardless of the suffix, the negation still applies.

Surely in your intro logic class they explained the significance of negation?

>Apparently, that's not enough to get people to actually read it.

Are you suggesting I didn't read it? Because surely my reply suggested that I did read it. I simply don't accept your reasoning that ""atheist"" is someone who actively prescribes to ""atheism"".

>It's particularly amusing to hear that redefining words is bad, from a group which is trying to claim success at having redefined a word.

My definition is close to the direct translation of the parent word. The word atheist derives from the Greek ""atheos"", which translates to ""godless"". Someone who has not even considered the possibility of a god (a non-agent according to you) can be without a god.

Also, I don't have a problem with the definitions of words changing, it happens all the time. I have a problem with changing definitions just to prove a point (which is what you're doing). Your intention hasn't been to find the true meaning of the word, but to condescend and proudly proclaim 'You're wrong, ""motherfuckers""'. 

> Using the blanket term ""atheist"" to describe persons who have rejected theism, persons who have never considered theism, and non-agents, is like using the blanket term 'mammal' to describe cats, and dogs, and bats.

Are you suggesting that the word mammal is somehow flawed? Because this doesn't seem to be helping your case. Why wouldn't we follow the 'mammal' example and have a blanket term to describe everything in the set as a whole, and have other distinct terms to describe the sub-groups? Do you honestly not see how blanket terms can be useful as well?

When I want to talk about a cat, I use the word cat. When I want to talk about mammals, I use the word mammal.

When I want to talk about those who do not have a belief in a god, I use the word atheist. When I want to discuss one of the sub-groups I use the appropriate terms (Agnostic/gnostic , strong/weak, or implicit/explicit).

">Have you got the point yet? 

Wow. What a condescending prick."
">Right, giving them a monetary value. But what is the value of a commodity? Does steel get it's value from its extrinsic worth? Or does it have a social value as a resource? A ceramic cup might only be valued at a few dollars, but its social value is measured in its ability to hold liquid for consumption. This is the crux of what I'm trying to get it: I don't care what a crypto currency is valued in trade, in which instance it becomes just another financial tool, a bourgeois means of extracting capital. I'm concerned with how it can be used to build social value, without relying on capital.

Cryptocurrencies are currencies. They value things exactly the same way markets do under capitalism (give or take some fucking legendary levels of fraud and market manipulation). It's just another kind of money. It doesn't introduce any socialist elements into an economy whatsoever. 

>My point is, banks are just data entries, a complex set of ledgers. 

Again, this is just wrong. That's not what banks are and it's not what they do. Banks use ledgers, but so do every other corporation, and neither could be replaced by an elaborate spreadsheet. A blockchain cannot lend you money, operate a savings account for you or facilitate debit/credit card networks - to do that you need whole other systems which add a whole other degree of cost and centralization to the system.

>As to your last point, you make my point. I think we have a fundamental disagreement about the necessity of banks. The monetary system is strangling society. It is the heart, pumping the black blood of capitalism. I mean, you're on an anarchist sub arguing for the need of financial service providers. Is this your first day? 

Whoa bud. You might want to learn what a bank is before you decide to get all condescending about it. My point was that an economic system based on blockchain is going to need financial services just like one based around traditional money. I'm not saying ""I like banks"", I'm just not delusional enough to think that a monetary system is going to function without them, or something very similar. Capitalism is not awful because of banks, banks are one of the many awful parts of capitalism. 

>The experiments that are being run with crypto are worthy of analysis. The vanguard of any capitalist venture will have blood on its hands, that's what it does. If capitalists lose capital as a result of shady financial dealings, that is not my concern. But the idea that they can be used to track the economic activity of an advanced society without the use of traditional currency is what I find interesting and subversive.

The crypto world absolutely should be studied. I follow it compulsively, and there's a lot to learn from it. The entire endeavour has been a spectacular failure in just about every regard and anarchists should probably understand why, if only to help guard against similarly half-baked ideas in the future. "
">Well the CBC had revenue of $1.53 Billion in 2006. That's their 2006 budget, so cuts would have had to be incredibly large in order for them to be particularly significant in light of their total budget. You're the one complaining that the cuts were too deep, so I assume you've got some source that outlines exactly how much government contributions to the CBC have been cut.


You can roll out the numbers to make them seem large, but it's kind of a ridiculous argument. The mandate of the CBC is gigantic. No other network has the responsibilities of the CBC, especially in non-profitable arenas. Minority language (eng. in QC, fr. in English Canada) and local reporting on terrestrial airwaves and many more services, especially in more remote communities that would not be otherwise provided.

>Rather than admit that a whole department isn't necessary to their budget and kill it

Define ""necessary"" and show me an entire department you would cut and why the effect would be small, yet somehow worth the cut's overall small % relative to funding, i.e. the reason it's a good idea.

>You're the one complaining that the cuts were too deep

Your own sources claim the cuts have reduced output. I'm mostly working on common sense arguments of...why would the CBC limit it's influence and further ensure it's own demise. An organization was cut. It reduced services. Not exactly the riddle of the sphinx. 

>The government does not have control over how the CBC allocates that budget. They cannot direct the CBC to cut unnecessary departments by budget allocation.It was not the only path to take, but it's the one that they chose.

Ugh, the italics don't make the argument better or any less condescending. Of course that's how it works. Now, if they cut funding, in a real world of dollars and cents, the CBC will have to make reductions. They would reduce the areas in which the impact will be least felt by listeners, but unfortunately that will still have negative effects. So the question is, was it really worth it? And what is the driving factor, evidence or ideology?

>they did NOT choose to take a hard look at what their core services should be. Instead they chose the route of trying increase revenue. That was their choice.

My what a ""fly-on-the-wall"" you are at the CBC main offices, I'm jealous. You're sort of right actually...

It's...weird. It's like...they feel this weird...responsibility towards services that....don't increase their profitability....I really wonder why they feel the need to fund these little services that the CTV doesn't :(

No, I assume that people who are down voting you don't like your tone, you have called me a dishonest sack of shit for asking a question, as well as the overall tone of your comments are very condescending and accusatory. They might also disagree with you, but I think its mostly your tone. Its also possible people who DO agree with you are down voting you as well because you are making piss poor arguments and calling people liars for no reason, and they would rather see someone defend their stance well than call names and claim facts with no evidence.

">Well, a couple of things. First off, I'm not saying we should tax people at 70%, I'm saying that is what the studies show.

Yes, studies, not actual results from real life examples. Like I said, when Bush and JFK lowered capital gain taxes down from 30% total revenue for taxes went up, not down, this, along with multiple other real life examples contradict what you are spreading. Mathematical studies cannot incorporate all the variables like human response and incentive, that's why they're not accurate. 

>And your last two paragraphs are insulting.

They are insulting? Hmm.. lets take a look here.

>You don't understand the complexities between taxation and government revenue. 

And you do? You have shown a profund amount of ignorance on the subject. I'm not the one suggesting that 70% taxation would yield the highest amount of revenue over a long period of time, like you are. 

>I'm not saying we should tax people at 70%, I'm saying that is what the studies show.

So your citing a study that you disagree with? If you don't agree with the study, or aren't ""saying we should"" then why are you quoting the study? You seem to have quoted a completely bogus study and now are having a difficult time distancing yourself from it. 

>You might as well be a child explaining light to a physicist.

Who exactly is the one insulting here? You are extremely insulting and condescending, I mean you actually compare me to a child and you to a physicist. 

> A paper by Trabandt and Uhlig of the NBER from 2009 presented a model that predicted that the US and most European economies were on the left of the Laffer curve (in other words, that raising taxes would raise further revenue).

Of course taxing 70% would initially result in higher revenue, until businesses that can't afford it begin to fail and the market becomes stagnant with extremely high unemployment, creating more people living off the government rather than contributing tax payers... If you put those models and studies to the test, it would be a spectacular failure because they do not incorporate important factors. You are picking studies and models that can't possibly incorporate every factor over real life examples, and they are directly contradicted by real life examples."

FYI - it still goes on. Legally.

That's great. Montana had 4 and he didn't need Rice for 2 of them.

I like how you try to be condescending and assume I don't know how James Harden is, but apparently don't know Harden's a PG now..

It's also a poor comparison, because there's literally no metric or measurable that Harden's ahead of MJ in, whereas there are plenty for Moss vs Rice.

> Rice put in the work - he'd run like 5 miles in the morning every day or something. He focused on winning so much. It's why players like Emmitt Smith are better than players like Barry Sanders.

Don't put words in my mouth, especially in such a condescending tone.

I have no interest in arguing over the relative benefits of various licensing schemes, I was simply stating a fact.

While Linus is adamantly against the draconian ""viral"" clauses in GPL3, I suspect that he would also disapprove of Nokia building a phone platform using Linux and including DRM and locked SIM cards.

See, now you are stepping into condescending territory here assuming I didn't read the page. It is actually you that didn't read the page because it shows his combine results as 4.46 which is WRONG. It doesn't even show his pro day performance. Also, pro days are taken with a grain of salt to a lot of teams. Unless you dramatically improve your combine performance, they take your combine over your pro-day as there is not near enough measures in place to ensure the validity of a pro-day performance as opposed to the highly judged and viewed combine performances.

Through all of what you said, the combine is still very important to teams. It is why players drop huge in their draft stock if they do shitty at combines. Te'o was a player who I recall that had a top 15/20 prospect attached to him even with all of the other irrelevant drama. He was shown to be slower and weaker in many tests so he went in the second round.

AGAIN I say..the combine isn't the only point at what teams look at but it is a big indicator of value of a person. The correlation is there for the team and time and time again this proves to be true from many who end up performing well on the field.

Practice is just that..practice and doesn't tell us anything concrete other than basic info. It is pretty much the combine version of draft prospects without the recorded stats. When game time is on and things are on the line is when it really counts. Some people are just bad at practice..some are bad at the combine but both do factor in the end result. The combine more so for drafting processes..and the practicing for team roster decisions."

Funny, that is exactly what everyone has been trying to tell you all along.
Comparing a scheduler-less epoll loop to a full blown concurrency framework makes no sense. That is why when Don wrote a similarly bare bones server in Haskell it ran 50% faster than the one using the concurrency framework.

Here's an NPR interview that describes what antifa is, the intellectual/political currents it comes out of, and what the ultimate goal of its practitioners is. Relevant section begins about 14 minutes in. 

 >Anyways, Antifa was started as the militant wing of socialist/communist groups, and the goal since day 1 has always been violence. Fascism was always just an excuse.

If you ""just want violence"" then you don't need to invent an excuse. That's fucking idiotic, you just go out and commit it. You don't need a justification. "

"> Profanity is a weak mind trying to express itself forcefully man. Try to just make your case.

Who is unironically THIS condescending? Fuck me man. 

The reason the idea of a straight pride march sounds ludicrous, is because straight people have never, ever, in any instance, been oppressed for their sexuality. It's absurd to think so. LGBT people have been consistently, through history and today throughout the world. That's all, that analogy doesn't need to go further.

Do you believe there is total equality between LGBT and cishet people? Do you think that just because legally, they are equal, that they actually are in practice? These aren't rhetorical; I'm interested in your response.

Trans people face the worst discrimination. They are consistently beaten and even killed simply for being who they want to be. If you deny this, you are being selectively blind. They are not accepted in society. That is a huge issue. When an entire group of people is denied acceptance due to their identity, that is a problem that must be fixed. This injustice is no longer solidified in law, but instead in the minds of a majority of the population. Pride parades help to fix that problem by bringing attention and awareness to their identity and the issues they face. "

"> The concept of gender identity is interesting but the way people act as though it's totally removed from biological sex is ridiculous.

I agree that people shouldn't completely separate 'biology' from 'social construction' in reference to gender, and they are connected, but the main reason people so passionately separate them is because the standard attitude is for people to equate genitals with the idea of ""man"" and ""woman"", instead of merely ""male"" and ""female"". It's a way of providing semantic clarity to people who suffer from gender dysphoria, a problem that wouldn't exist if society weren't constantly expecting people to conform to the ""gender"" of their genitals.

> Sex and behaviour correlate highly in pretty much every species

Your use of the word ""behavior"" and ""correlate"" here are vague enough to make this sentence almost meaningless.

> If you are an uncommon exception to normality, then you should be referred to a specialist, not coddled by cotton wool society and told ""YOU KNO IT DOESNT MATTER U FEEL LIKE WOMAN I GIV U VAGINA.I GVE U VIG VAGINAS AN CHANG UR BIRTH SERTIFICATE AND OSCIETY WILL ASCEPT U""

This is condescending and riddled in what sound like political sound-bytes. Society should change to make it easier for people who do suffer from gender dysphoria to be able to seek treatment or help. If society weren't so bent on putting people into little categories for the sake of convenience and simplicity, there would not be any the 'tumblr feminists' out there ""irritating"" you about it. And anyway, transgendered people who go through re-assignment surgery are fully aware that society isn't going to be understanding or accepting of them, but they do it anyway because they know their sex does not match their gender.

> ...but it's dangerous to view it as the default course of action when someone feels a bit unsure about themselves.

This just sounds paranoid. It's not like children come up to their parents and say ""I don't think I'm a boy"" and then the parents would just immediately start making preparations for their child to start putting a different gender on paper/to get surgical re-assignment without taking the time to think it through and talk about it.

In comparison they are theoretically in a better position to stop a smaller number of units before they reach the mineral line by being able to swarm those units with superior numbers. Hence controlling access through superior numbers instead of static buildings. This has been Blizzards intention for the design; how well it works is another matter but you will never see a zerg wall in the sense of terran and protoss they should be using numbers for defense.

>Trade is not a zero-sum game.

Good statement, dawg. This is something you can say to make it sound like you know what you're talking about. It probably doesn't concern you that these lower costs come from slave labor, does it?

I mean, even now, work in China is close to slave labor. I worked there for 2 years as head of marketing for a major cross-borders e-commerce company in Shenzhen. The working conditions fucking suck. And guess what? China is losing its competitiveness in cheap labor. Because they are now paying too much for the labor. 

So enjoy shipping your work out to west Africa so they can work 18 hour days 30 fucking days in a row with a weekend off every once in a while. There, have your cheap goods dude... 

Do you really not get that if someone buys cheap goods, they break? And then they buy them multiple times? Plus when you are shipping goods across the sea... they break. So you're really not saving money. You are contributing to slave labor. You are removing the possibility of these jobs existing in the USA. You are sending money to another country... hence the fucking trade deficit. 

You absolutely do lose money on trade. It's the easiest thing for a chinese person to sell to USA. It's hard as FUCK for an American to sell to China. Therefore all of that money is LEAVING the UNITED STATES because they are then spending it IN CHINA. Sure they buy some of our goods but they're taxed to high hell. Apple, possibly the most influential and powerful company in the world, has been battling with China for years to sell their products. Why sell an iPhone when you can just steal the plans, call it Huawei and tax iPhones so they are much harder to get. Now, they are still a status symbol, so the more western minded and wealthy chinese do have them. Yet the potential revenue of Apple in China is crippled, as almost everyone knows. Their market share is predicted to fall.

Meanwhile we're buying our projectors, TVs, kitchen utilities, lighters, skateboards... fucking everything... from China. That money is going from our pockets into theirs and it's not coming back.

That is losing money. 

Harley fucking Davidson, are you kidding me. Yes the company that has seen sales plummet every fucking year for the past 5 is now being so devastated by brand new tariffs.

">The subject of how Batesian mimicry can evolve in the context of natural selection has been thoroughly discussed and debated.

You tried to make it sound like those papers proved that evolution account for mimicry. Quite the contrary.

Actually, I am right. I said there is no actual science proving that evolution can account for mimicry and I am right. You are acting like it is a proven foregone conclusion. 

>I don't understand why anyone would conclude that all of the experts are wrong

No, it is you that is wrong. You are acting like this has been proven - it hasn't. You are just dogmatically sticking to an unproven hypotheis the same way science has countless times in the past, until the entrenched status quo finally has to admit that the final evidence to demonstrate their theory isn't right around the corner like they insisted, and they're model isn't correct.

Although I'm sure that there are many other quests where the hints are totally inadequate, but I'm just guessing based on past experience with games that have detective modes. 

>That's just your opinion, and that has never been a consistent theme in open world games

Well, it's my opinion, but I'm trying to make it clear why I think quest markers and fast travel turn these open world games into just a series of linear encounters. Open worlds, as they are in this generation, are much more like large level select screens than immersive exploration experiences. If mystery of the unknown is at all a component of exploration, then these games fail at exploration. Maybe they are great at plenty of other things, but the exploration aspect is so muted that they basically are just level select screens you can move around on.

That segment would have been a perfectly ok viewpoint had you not used the word ""entitled"". Entitlement has nothing to do with it. Entitlement is the feeling that you are inherently owed something. TRP's turn to TRP because (they believe) typical sexual strategies have failed them, or for whatever reason women prefer other men/other types of men over them. If being ""themselves"" has failed them for approaching 3 decades, they decided to be someone else. 

Systematic misuse of other people is purely a result of it being the most effective method of attracting women. If it wasn't effective, TRP wouldn't be a a thing. It's not men's fault women prefer jerks over Nice Guys.

>It's the definition of self-defeating; they might as well migtow it up and get into relationships with other red pill men. Those are the only people they're willing to listen to or trust anyway.

This segment condescends men for not trusting women, which infers that women are, for some reason, inherently deserving of trust, when they're not. This is entitlement on your part (ironically). If women prove themselves chronically untrustworthy, why would anyone, man or woman, trust women? Maybe your experience of women (or any other group of individuals) is positive. That's not everyone's experience.

>You can't fake being someone you aren't. There's no cheat code to being a self-contained, calm, thoughtful and tempered man.

I've never known a 'natural alpha', to use some pretty terrible shorthand, that hadn't been through some shit in his life. His priorities straighten out. He stops being twisted up and narcissistic and transparently insecure. He's just over it. That's an alpha in my book. Not some loudmouth idiot meathead who acts like a pissy three-year-old girl. Some chicks like that, I guess, they can have 'em

So, your advocating to men to be less successful...just because? Again, attraction is not a choice. Being a ""self-contained, calm, thoughtful, and tempered man"" isn't going to make women randomly appear in your lap. What TRP offers is a reproducible, error checking system in which men create results and feel IN CONTROL of their sex/love life as women do. You're asking men to give that up for the sake of treating women well, who, quite honestly couldn't give less of a fuck about having empathy for men, male issues, or men's struggles in the sexual marketplace? That's not a very convincing argument m'lady...

> Now pillers just loathe it when women so-called 'shit test' them, lie to them and manipulate them, but feel perfectly within their rights to try to intellectualize their way through relating to her.

How can you trust her, when you know deep down you're not acting from your heart but from your Ethernet cable, and her responses are therefore automatically invalid? You can't build trust hiding behind a giant old damn play-pretend luxury persona.

A cat owner loves their cat. A cat owner is under no illusions that the cat won't bite you when it's playing with your sock feet. It's in it's nature. Women do what women do because it's in their nature. You can trust a woman to be a woman, and in that sense, it's still possible to love them.

I dunno...you're not sounding very not personal...I'm halfway through responding to your essay and so far, you've suggested TRP's aren't real men, they don't deserve love or respect, they should agree to be less successful for the sake of women, and they should all go gay and fuck each other instead...

>If you try to play the game with a facsimile it's never going to be something that helps or heals the wounds the past leaves, you never really win, your heart just keeps bleeding in your pocket and the whole situation just fills you with contempt eventually. You hate her because she doesn't know you, but that's not because she's actually a brainless bint or would dump you if she knew you, it's because you lied to her.

This is a nice/sweet sentiment, but I don't agree it's reality. Realistically, she probably wouldn't have gotten with you had she known ""the real you"" in the first place. 

There was a post on AskWomen...maybe 2 years ago...I'll never forget it. One of the regular posters was upset her big strong alpha wouldn't emotionally open up to her; she didn't know ""who he really was"". She begged and begged for months for him to come to couples therapy to get him to open up. He said no because you'll leave me if you knew me deep down. She promised she wouldn't, she loves him, he's a real man, blah blah. So eventually he agrees to go, gets to therapy and starts confessing his insecurities, his hopes, his dreams, his feelings on this and that. She was so (in her own words) disgusted by his emotions and lack of masculinity that she dumped him 2 weeks later. 

No attractive masculine man is himself...he is the version of himself he knows other people want to see, and the emotional ""Nice Guys"" who wear their insecurities on their shoulder aren't the ones you're taking home at night because they're the antithesis of masculine attractiveness. Women don't want to date women with penises.

>Not all women want a fucking Mercedes. Some of us wouldn't trust a so-called Mercedes as far as we could throw one. I'd rather have a genuine Ford Focus than a goosed-up knockoff of a luxury car that broke down every time I sneezed.

All women want a Mercedes. Lets not be absolutely silly...All women want a Mercedes. There's not really any arguing that. Women are biologically programmed to seek out the single best (looks, money, fame, dominance) male in their vicinity. You can't impress your friends with a ford focus. You cant bring a ford focus home to mother. Some women may not like the paint job of a particular Mercedes. Some women may compromise and pick the slightly cheaper BMW instead because it's interior is so much nicer, and it comes with dual-side airbags and a sweet sound system, but no women want the focus. 

>What? No. No, not at fucking all actually, attractive jerks are the last thing some of us need in our lives. Some of us prefer people more like us, whom we can relate to. I don't care how pretty his face is if the only thing that ever comes out of his head is shit.

That has never, once in my life, been my experience, nor the experience of most of the men in the community. This isn't something that only RP preaches, it's a common, socio-cultural trope. Women prefer jerks. Hell, there was even a study that confirmed women would rather have an attractive jerk with masculine qualities yet treated her poorly than a nice guy with ambiguous qualities who treated her great. I wish I kept the study. 

Being nice or a jerk has nothing to do with anything in my experience; women want maybe 2 or 3 specific qualities and they don't care what package it comes in. The jock jerk will always be more successful than Timmy NiceGuy. Always. Forever. 

> I draw a deep distinction between someone who maybe doesn't have all his shit together and someone who's spoiling to make terrible assumptions about me and lie to me at the first sign of trouble. If anything can be counted on in real love, it's trouble. When I say I can't stand cruelty, I mean the systematic cruelty of dehumanization and everything that leads to.

You realize that women do this far more systematically than men right? Women generally treat men like Pokemon cards. Gotta collect the holograph1cz yo! TRP as a systematic ....system which may or may not be cruel depending on how you look at it, was formed out of a need for men to be able to combat the systematic cruelty they already experience from women. Men had no power in the sexual marketplace and women held and still really do hold all the cards. It's not like men are going to sit idly by. Really, your issue should be with women and the way they both A) treat men as a gender and B) validate jerk behavior/cruelty by rewarding them with sexual validation as opposed to nice(r) guys who fail consistently.

It's way easier to just pick some positions, vote for the guy who agrees with most of them, and then immediately withdraw your support as soon as he compromises on one avenue you don't like.

You seem to be making an awful lot of condescending assumptions, there, RedDyeNumber4.

There's a lot more than one avenue to go down with this, but let's leave health care and the Wall Street mess and everything else aside for a second. Would you have voted for Obama if he campaigned on the idea that he would authorize the murder of an American citizen without a trial?

Is that the guy you voted for? Is that the kind of idea that created the populist mandate? I have no illusions about the compromises that are needed to govern, but if the Bush administration had sanctioned the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki without a trial, wouldn't you be outraged? Wouldn't you expect others to be outraged? Wouldn't you expect a protest on the National Mall every damn day until someone's head rolled? Wouldn't you feel slightly dumbfounded at the idea that other Americans seem to consider this acceptable (especially in light of all the other measures passed in the last nine years--which also haven't gone away in the last two)?

Democrats love to protest--they're good at it and it's a good thing--but when their own guy is in charge, they suddenly clam up. It's sick. Obama got voted in on the hope of change, but he's proven himself to be a company man through and through, and his company is only interested in keeping things exactly the way they are--screwed.

"> The price of renewables and the price of fossil fuels fuels will eventually converge, but we need to make that happen faster, we can't wait until the price converges naturally due to scarcity of fossil fuels.

If that was true, we would already be seeing the opportunity costs fall, because investors would be able to realize significant benefits from investing now. Of course, things aren't nearly as apocalyptic as Econ 103 students would like to believe, and thus we don't see the massive energy transition they want. 

>Global warming is a problem now and there is a critical point.

No, it isn't, at least not to the degree you're imagining. If global warming had the impact you claim it does now, we would see the market account for those costs, but of course, the costs don't currently exist to that extent and thus we don't account for them to that extent. You're literally saying your views as a 103 student are better informed and more developed than the entire field of energy economics and investment. That isn't ""market failure.""

>You're focusing on short term profits when this is a long run problem.

And if the energy companies get stunted from inefficient opportunity costing and utilization, we get hurt in the long run more than anything. You don't seem to understand what the ""long run"" entails.

>In the end Germany will come out ahead. 

In the end all energy systems will come out ahead because they will all eventually transition and move to more efficient systems as the costs of those systems become appropriate. The only thing Germany is doing is forcefully distributing it's share in an inefficient way and paying the direct cost for it. Its baffling to me how you're so condescending and sure of yourself yet you don't understand the concept of opportunity costs, at this point in the semester you should have had an exam on it by now.

>Fossil fuels are only necessary for back up power.

Fossil fuels are currently the backbone of all energy systems. If those producers become less efficient from a less efficient energy share, someone has to pay for those increased costs.

>You also seem incapable of understand how investment leads to cost savings in the long run, which is worrying.

You don't understand the difference between Technology and Investment. While they can be related, Investment doesn't magically increase Technology, and if T isn't economically viable, I will not follow. If sinking money into something lowered the costs of things absolutely, there would be a technological singularity. In reality, I and T are kept separate for very specific reasons. 

Forcing money into renewable technology won't magically make it cheaper, and if the investment you're forcing wasn't already occurring, chances are you're ending up at net negative cost savings over doing anything else with the money. Again with the opportunity costing."

Many of those people don't have the support networks available to you or others to get ""help"" from. They have dysfunctional families and zero friends. Therapy is a grueling, taxing process that took me years to get the ball rolling. Plus, if those mental issues include lack of self-esteem, then it's even harder to get help because you don't think you even deserve it, or firmly believe you're inherently broken. Is that an unhealthy way to think? Obviously. But that's the reality of severe mental health issues."
"OK. It looks like the distinction that you're drawing between permissible and impermissible preferences is this:

It is permissible to either 

1) have a preference for a quality that you do not have if that quality is a physical characteristic (height or hair color are ""just a preference for a particular physical feature""); or 

2) have a preference for a quality that is not a physical characteristic only if you share that quality (unlike height or hair color, partner count is ""a feature of someone's history"" and it is permissible to prefer someone with a similar partner count).

Let's examine that distinction. According to your reasoning, the following would be impermissible preferences based on non-physical characteristics:

 Preference for a person who has had a different educational background than you have. If you are a business major, you should not prefer a person who majored in literature, and vice versa.

 Preference for a person whose professional history differs from yours. According to your reasoning, wanting to date someone in a different line of work is not a permissible preference, because it is a non-physical characteristic and not identical to your correlative characteristic.

 Preference for a person who is either dominant or submissive in bed. Because this is a non-physical characteristic, it is impermissible for you to prefer someone who differs from you in this regard.

 If you are a type A personality, you cannot prefer a person who is a type B personality, and vice versa.

 If you have a mental illness, you cannot prefer to date someone who does not have a mental illness, or who has a different mental illness than you do.

 If you are not sexually experienced, you cannot prefer to date someone who is more sexually experienced than you are.

Similarly, under your formulation, a person who obsessively only wanted to date Asian women would not have a puerile preference, because that is a preference based on a physical trait that he does not share with the objects of his preference.

The point that I'm trying to make is not that you should reformulate a logical test that would better identify what characteristics it is and is not permissible to want. The point I'm trying to make is that any such test will lead to absurd results. Why? Because there is no good logical reason why one adult should not be able to prefer certain qualities in a potential adult mate. If I want to only date women who are nationally ranked Magic: The Gathering players, it is my prerogative to have that preference. That preference does not hurt you (except to the extent that it incentivizes all the hot chicks to get really good at Magic obviously). That preference is, frankly, none of your business.

Also, I am not personally saying that I only want to date virgins. In fact, I don't want to date a virgin. Virginity is a negative quality, as far as I am concerned. I just want to date women who have a lower partner count than I have. However, the fact that I don't want to date virgins does not mean that wanting to date virgins is an impermissible preference. It's simply one that I don't share. Further down in the thread is a woman who says that she prefers virgins. Is she puerile?

Lastly, I thought that in 2015 it should be acceptable for an adult to prefer whatever characteristic in another adult that he wants, whether he wants to date a man or a woman or a transgendered person, or a person with red hair or a person with a higher or lower partner count. Apparently I was wrong.

> while companies have never been richer, the poverty rate isn't changing.

Companies getting richer is a problem. The problem is that competition has become increasingly difficult. Far fewer businesses are started today. Here's a citation for you. When you have less competition, profits go up.

I'm not sure why you'd expect to see a drop in US poverty. It's losing jobs to places that have true poverty, so it's hard for Americans to compete on wages--and they can't compete on much else. You'd need effective social programs to help, and you don't have that.

In any case, though, full employment means wages start to go up. And sure enough, they are; the trend in the last couple years is towards real, actual wage growth.

> [Millennial are doing poorly]

When you come right down to it, for them to do better the economy would have to change. Or, I guess, we'd have to dramatically raise taxes and dramatically redistribute wealth.

The Left wants to hamstring the economy and redistribute wealth, turning the country into an unsustainable charity system. Higher corporate taxes hamper the competitiveness of American companies abroad. More regulation means that starting up new businesses is harder, which means less competition, which means higher corporate profits and lower wages (because there's no competition for employees).

At the same time, the Right has lost it's fucking mind.

> meanwhile corporations have never had more cash or lower taxes. And what do they do with that money? Make their own lives easier. None found its way to employees - as we showed earlier.

See, if you knew anything about economics you'd know that lower corporate taxes are fine. You immediately seem to confuse what they are when you say they ""make their own lives easier"". What lives? Are you talking about corporations making their metaphorical 'corporate' lives easy? Or are you talking about the execs and shareholders?

If you want to tax the execs and shareholders...how about you do that instead? Tax high earners. US companies have a hard enough time competing abroad; why kneecap them with very high corporate taxes?

You know that all those leftie Scandinavian social democracies have low-to-0% corporate taxes?

> So you might think someone is ""entitled"" because they want a living wage for a full-time job.

...Handed to them by default. Where ""living wage"" means affording a house and car and supporting a family in modern-day America. Yep, I do think that's entitled. That's an expectation that a very small percentage of the people in the world today can have--even in developed countries. Forget about the past as recently as a generation ago, where more than half of tho population of the world was at immediate risk of starvation. The only group in history that could expect that was Americans from the 1950's to the ~1980's, for complex historical reasons, and even then we're looking back with rose-colored glasses: things were not as easy as millennials make out, and expectations have risen.

That post is Economics 101, man. You may be under the impression that wage rates come down from On High, but they're determined by supply and demand, full stop. Governments have some ability to nudge and fiddle with the rate a bit (at the danger of causing all sorts of negative side effects). They pretend_, in particular when they're on the campaign trail, that they have absolute power. They don't.

But no, sure, feel free to explain why my post was misguided. If you're so expert with economics that you were able to spot basic flaws in my argument and determine I had no clue what I was talking about, it shouldn't be hard to point them out.

No, they don't. Some do, yes, but assuming that constitutes the majority of gamers is simply wrong. Synth was talking on Hat's stream the other day about how some guy (TotalBiscuit, I think?) saying that anything on the PC that wasn't 60 fps was simply unplayable, and that led into a digression about how he didn't like the notion of sitting there and tweaking settings all day to get every last bit of performance because he, as a console player, just wanted to play the fucking game.

"I think we're actually trying to solve different problems. Either that, or you don't give a shit about subjective experience, and see every DNS+TCP request as an all-or-nothing scenario, indivisible, which failures and unnecessary dependencies for all.

> By your original hypothesis that a congested network is likely to drop DNS queries, I'm suggesting an equal probability that a DNS query would succeed whereas a TCP SYN would fail. So you've got an answer to your query, and you can't do anything about it except wait for TCP's session setup mechanism to time out. You've kicked the can, but haven't actually solved a problem.

Sure. It's not a problem that can be perfectly solved. But let's come back to the idea of having more than one client on the same network, or the same client making a request without its local cache intact. By providing a local caching recursive resolver, that data is still on your network.

Again, simple statistics. If you have two events, A and B, which both must succeed in order for your end result to be a success, and A and B both individually have a 50% chance of success, then your aggregate chance of success is 50% 50%, or 25%. So if you've already handled A (by having a cached result available on the network), you're only dependent on B, so your aggregate chance of success is now 50%. If you can't follow that concept...I don't know what I can say.

> No, there's an actual reason for this. And, just as a note, lots of the TCP connections you're talking about and piecemeal site loading goes away with HTTP/2 / SPDY protocols. But now we're getting pretty far off the original topic of reliability by local DNS cache.

Sigh. Not all resources will come from the same host. And not all websites support HTTP2 / SPDY. The biggest ones, sure. But unless you're suggesting that a connection to  http  is going to proxy out to the myriad of external resources needed for, e.g. social widgets and cross-site image embedding, then HTTP2 / SPDY don't solve your problem.

And I'll point out, every year, we've seen more and more external widgets loaded. That's why I run Ghostery; page loading performance tanks when it's dependent on all of these external components.

> If you're interested in actual observational data collected by more than a single user and single perspective, I'd suggest looking into ""DNS Day in the Life"" which you can find  http 

So, my background, then. I've been responsible for the code for the DNS-driven traffic director for a CDN which used to serve around half of Netflix's traffic. More recently, I've maintained the infrastructure at an MSP serving up hundreds of websites, and maintaining the networks of around a half dozen offices with several dozen users, often with less than stellar network connectivity because you simply couldn't buy better. This shit is what I do.

So if we're done with the condescending attitudes, let's try to figure out why we're talking past each other.

> Ok, so earlier you were talking about performance concerns, but now you suspect a managed CDN service is going to have two or more layers of CNAME. In practice (from working for a DNS company and a company that offers CDN), you're wrong.

And as someone who works for a DNS company, and has worked for a CDN probably larger than yours, I happen to know I'm not. Having studied CDN architecture before I went to work for them, I also happen to know that there are at least a dozen different CDN architectures across the industry as a whole. (If you're curious, give Content Delivery Networks a read. My former employer's network is in there.)

You're looking at things from the DNS provider's side of the fence. I've sat there, and now I sit here on the consumer's side of the fence. It looks a little different on this side.

> Just accept that a local DNS cache doesn't actually offer reliability for network outages, because it doesn't solve any of the following problems from the network outage.

This isn't BGP. I'm not talking about a circuit going down when we're talking about a network outage.

This also isn't a DDoS. I'm not talking about a 10GbE link getting saturated with 100Gb/s of inbound traffic, or even a 100Mb/s link getting saturated with 1Gb/s of inbound. We're not talking about a scenario where only a few percent of packets get through.

I'm talking about when you've got a network fully consumed by permitted traffic, and don't (and possibly can't, because of silly bursting behavior by the ISP, or oversubscribed local loops) have adequate QoS in place. When you're seeing packet loss on the order of 1-5%, and that's enough to have a DNS timeout at least once a day.

Having a caching recursive resolver on your network works wonders in circumstances like that."

Who said that we were only talking about short term relationships? I was talking about longer term relationships as well. I don't think it makes sense to exclusively think about short term relationships, even in the context of discussing total number of partners. Additionally, I think that there is a Lucas critique problem in your argument. Women are currently exercising caution when they have one night stands, so empirical emergency room data is not an indicator of how important caution during one night stands is. According to my beliefs, if women exercised the same amount of lack of caution as men, we would see more women end up in the emergency room after one night stands. But so far, this has not happened. What we do know is that men are more violent overall, and women seem to be more cautious overall, and that violence against women by men is overall worse than violence against men by women. I would say that there is probably a causal relationship there. I think you're being willfully ignorant if you deny that this is a fairly reasonable inference to make.

If I had solicited/demanded money from other people telling them I needed it to buy toilet paper for others, then invested the money I collected for toilet paper and used the profits to buy a grand house for myself and start a bonfire with toilet paper, the people who gave me money would be justified in criticizing that decision.

The thing is, the church's money came from me. It came from my parents, who faithfully paid tithing and extra fast offering even when we didn't have enough money for groceries. We all gave money to the church because we believed they would use it for charitable purposes, not a for-profit venture. 

I think a lot of people hope the church is rather more like the new pope's version of Catholicism. St Peter's Basilica is a Catholic equivalent to Temple Square, and people at the top of the Catholic hierarchy were also worried that it's value would decrease as it became more surrounded by homeless people. Instead of building an elegant and costly for-profit shopping center, the pope put in showers for the homeless.

The question is not ""why can God exist without a cause"", implying that He is a contingent being, and an exception to the rule. The question is ""why does God exist"", and the answer to this question is that it is in His nature to exist. Just as it is in His nature to be the Creator of thing that have been created.
The question - ""what explains God"" then becomes ""why isn't God in the category of things that require external explanations"" - the answer? His nature. ""Why is God the thing that necessarily exists?"" Because anything that necessarily exists is God, anything that necessarily exists simply is (i.e. I AM).

> You can't go out and claim that you saw a dinosaur in your backyard and ask other people to disprove your claim if they don't believe you. The you are burdened to prove that what you are claiming is true, not the other way around. It's basic logic.

I get what you are saying, but I don't think that it is an accurate representation of what is going on. The elephant in the room is that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has also measured the existence of said dinosaur for a really long time. Between everyone in this thread, we all know this common knowledge. To say otherwise makes me think that you are feigning ignorance. Sure, there could very well be flaws in the government's analysis, but that isn't common knowledge. 

If I was the original commenter I would have cited anyways, and I did cite when I spoke. But you brushed it off as not being evidence (I guess you missed page 5 of The Gender Wage Gap: Extent, Trends, and Explanations where it explains what the co variances they are controlling are), so I guess we just disagree there. If you expected to come in here, have other people do all the work of research, and refute without presenting any outside citations of other people's thinking, that is false. I have been able to get you to produce three citations supposedly on the wage gap:

1. Hypothetical ""would you hire this employee?"" study
2. Controlling for Overwork accounts for 10% of the total wage gap study
3. Differences in vacation days study

Taken together this paints a vague picture of a world where men and women could be paid the same for the same work. How can you know for sure? These three are probably not enough to say that the wage gap is a myth, especially when there have been specific recent instances of problems.

Beyond all this, does controlling for all these factors show that there is no sexism in the U.S. capitalist economy? I think you are right to imply that there aren't as many discriminatory bosses as in the past, and the government has taken steps to limit discrimination. But the uncontrolled wage gap still exists for women, particularly women of color. What does that say about who has the most power in the current society overall? That shows a significant unequal power distribution, the wage gap is a symptom. That's why modern feminists thinkers are concerned about it. Not primarily because of discrimination on the individual level, but because of the systemic social issue of unequal power share for women, particularly minority women. To say that the wage gap is a myth because people who work the same job always get paid the same ignores that unequal distribution. Now if you see that unequal distribution and you blame that on women themselves, I don't know what to say because that sounds like sexism to me.

>I think feminism is about venting misplaced frustrations... Young women are all feminists these days, and none of them know why and none of them can defend their positions against basic logical questions.

">Sir keep in mind I am a US citizen, and even though I am well traveled I did not spend a lot of time driving. Mainly I used public transportation, because most civilized nations, and some not so civilized, have excellent public transit systems. So I'm going to narrow the focus of my response on driving/statistics in the US.

Interesting. Your counterintuitive take on the statistics (speed limits don't have much impact?) is also not backed up by experience. I appreciate your honesty (admitting you haven't driven much), but I think if you had more experience driving you'd see that there is a connection between risks (injury, death) and rate of speed when driving a car, esp. when sharing a highway with many other cars. It's good to hear that you've used so much public transit, but I wonder if you would include the U.S. on your list of civilized nations that have excellent public transit systems, because I would say that this is generally not true for the US (I'm talking about the quality of their public transit system, not their level of civilization - that's another discussion).

>The point I was trying to make when I said, Deaths from speeding = X. That isn't the whole story. What else was taken into account? e.g., drunkeness, weather conditions, & seatbelt usage., is that just stating a statistic without revealing your methodology is suspect.

You misunderstood my question. I was asking if you think that any of those three driving behaviors would be made in any way safer if the driver were also speeding. Obviously, none of them would be safer (and result in fewer injury or death-causing accidents) if speeding were added into the equation. I wasn't asking you to pick the safest of the three.

I never said that. If you don't know the difference between past and present tenses, I suggest you go back to grade school.

> So you take his satire literally....because you don't like it?

Satirical racism is still racism. You can't justify racism with comedy.

> Why does that matter?

Because that's the whole point we're obviously disagreeing on. Mugabe insulted gay people as a whole, publicly and intentionally. The satirical racist redditor insulted African people as a whole, but using a platform which will never reach his actual intended target, thereby insulting everyone who reads his racist comment, but it is unlikely the very person he targeted will ever read his comment. I explained that earlier and multiple times. That's like if I replied to you on my facebook account, rather than on this thread. You wouldn't read my comments, so there'd be no discussion, and no point would be made. That's my whole point. You say he was being satirical, and that he was making a point. I say he was being racist, and failed to make his point, as far as I'm concerned. If his point got across to you, good on you, but it didn't get across to me, which is often the problem with satire, you only get your point across to people who already agree with you, which is kind of pointless, when you think about it.

> Or they could understand why Mugabe's not exactly setting an example.

Did you need a racist comment to understand homophobia isn't a good thing? Really?

> No, because 'any gay' doesn't have an entire nation following him. His statements are not going to be as influencial. You have to reduce both to two people having a conversation for your example to work, which I can only assume is important to do in order to be racially offended, which is going some.

Again, that's assuming he's influencing his people's stance on homosexuality, as opposed to his people's stance on homosexuality influencing his own. This is an egg vs chicken situation, and while his comments obviously aren't making things better for the African LGBT community, it's not like he was making those comments in a country that is otherwise tolerant of LGBTs, it's not the case, as was demonstrated by the link I posted a few comments back. He's not a Muslim introducing Sharia law into a country which didn't have it, he's a homophobic person bred by a homophobic society who tells his people what he thinks they want to hear, just like every politician in the world does to get votes. Likewise, there are racist politicians who don't mind contributing to racial hatred to further their political career, that's nothing new. I also don't agree with the apology you make, that when someone doesn't have an entire nation ""following"" them, it's okay for them to spread racial hatred.

> And you got given lots of examples - but then, you were very busy offering your explanation of what, er, someone else meant.

What examples? You kept repeating the same pot/kettle argument, which I acknowledged by disagreeing with it. I just went through your meager ""contributions"" to this discussion and you've been nothing but condescending from the time you decided to invite yourself in a discussion that didn't concern you, at which point you offered your explanation for what you think someone else meant, claiming they were being satirical, and all. Do you even know what satire is? A one-liner (""Black people look like apes because the president of Zimbabwe called gay people lower than dogs."") isn't my idea of satire.

> I think I said you should already have figured it out. Which you didn't.

I understand what you're saying, I simply disagree with you.

> You took lots. But you weren't really interested in comprehension.

Again, just because I disagree with what you're saying, doesn't mean I don't understand what you're saying.

> No, I've observed you telling someone else what they meant. Then you've done it to me too. That's what happens when you think you're telling someone like it is without realising you haven't grasped what they're talking about.

And you've done it to me, too, what's your point? That you're as much a hypocrite as the racist I was initially talking to? I had that figured a long time ago.

> Oh, fuck off. (Oops. That'll end in war, now, according to your 'logic' - and you wonder why words like 'hysterical' are used)

Tell me what I meant more, please? I hope you can at least see the ridicule in this. You accuse me of doing what you've been doing from the beginning... If you don't understand how it takes two to tango, that's not my fucking problem.

> Indeed, which is why Mugabe should know better - but then, he does have plenty form. I don't really see any harm in someone lampooning him for doing so, either.

Ok, so Mugabe should know better, we agree on that. But why can't you understand that everyone doesn't share the same sense of humor (don't I make that obvious?), and that what is funny to some people can be offending to others, despite their intent.

> You're right, I think we can agree that you really didn't get it :-)

I get that you think someone can be right or wrong in a matter of opinion, which is absurd. At least, I try to acknowledge your side of the coin, while all you do is act condescendingly towards me, implying that I don't get something, just because I disagree with it.

You do know that people have died in the last couple of weeks because French people like satire, while Muslims don't? Are you cool with those deaths? Obviously, freedom of speech trumps terrorism, but in the end, innocent people in many countries were attacked because of a handful of French people's idea of what's funny to them. What about those innocent victims who probably never will even read a ""Charlie Hebdo"" publication, but who are stuck suffering because of it?

It's similar to if you were born and raised in NYC and suddenly found yourself talking to someone who grew up in the outbacks of Australia. You probably wouldn't even begin to fathom what living there is like. That's literally what they were expressing, it's noisy, it has too many parties...they couldn't live there.

Also, I'd argue that money opens up the world and therefore by extension their world view. You can't know that much about the world if you've only ever lived and been to one country, if you've only ever been poor/middle class, arguably everyone's worldview is very much limited based on their own lives and perspectives, it's just the manner to which it is limited.

>you seem to think you're limited console can handle anything you throw at and you're wrong


Oh, now consoles can't handle anything? Hm, I guess it's a miracle that my PS4 can run mods, because according to you my 'limited console' cannot handle anything. I truly am blessed to have such a magical, odds-defying device in my possession.


Snark aside, consoles aren't nearly as bad as you appear to think they are. The mod limit is unnecessary, and stability of the game itself has nothing to do with the limit. Stability depends on a multitude of factors, including the strain of the content.


Having 100 small tweaks that do not conflict nor add any scripts/content will not impact my game's stability in any meaningful way.


Loading 100 mods which add ridiculously detailed textures and objects, or those with a lot of scripts, would impact my game's performance.


Do you see what I'm getting at here? The stability of the game depends on the content of the mods themselves, not the sheer number of them. To my knowledge, the only way it could cause problems is if I had 255 mods installed, as 255 is the games absolute limit of loadable plugins for technical reasons."

To answer the first part, where do you get the idea it would be free access like some corner store will just be passing them out to anyone who wants some, young or old? You would still have to pay for it and I doubt most legitimate businesses do not want to be known as the place that gives methamphetamine to children. 

I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but there are already free and easy access to drugs. I could probably get some weed on my way home from work. So on this point it wouldn't change anyway.

Second, prohibition on drugs makes it much harder to seek rehabilitation from an addiction without landing some jail time. Prohibition is only going to fill jail cells with drug users who otherwise were not violent criminals. Drug problems are not criminal, they are medical.

So what if someone kills themselves on drugs? hundreds of thousands of people kill themselves with alcohol and cigarettes. For you to be consistent, you must advocate complete vice Prohibition and then be completely ignorant of history to think that is a good idea.

You're implying that games aren't catered to men. If they were catered more to women, more women would buy games. We see that games are marketed to men, not women, so your point is completely moot.

>Absolutely not. The trend of using the death or threat of death of a woman as a plot device shows in no way the woman as property. That is absolutely dehumanizing to both parties.

Anita doesn't make games, she has no responsibility to solve the problem. She's highlighting the problem. Why is this argument brought up by concern trolls so much? She shows positive representations, she highlights the misogyny in games and why they're misogynistic. She doesn't need to show solutions because the solution is obvious: avoid or subvert these tropes because they're sexist.

>You're talking like them appealing to men is a choice on their part. They appeal to men because mainly men have play it. 

That's circular logic. They market to men, so men play it. Men don't automatically play games. In the past, games were marketed to men and women but due to the exclusion of women in STEM fields, in gradually began to focus more on men. Games don't exist in a vacuum. They're mainly designed by men and marketed to men, and those things can change. Men don't explicitly play games just because its in their nature. Men play games because games are marketed to men, and they market to men because they have the same short sighted opinion as you: that women don't play 'real' games.

Pettis trains TKD and kickboxing simultaniously, it isn't mutually exclusive. He uses TKD for his kicking and some footwork stuff, you don't fucking switch between styles, you integrate it into one.

"> Again, you're the one creating an arbitrary line of what's necessary

It's not arbitrary. To say it's arbitrary is to misunderstand why the line even exists. Things don't become necessary to say due to their innate importance, they become necessary to say because we know that so many people care about them to an extent that would change their decision of consent. We say them because of stories like this (and less severe ones that simply lead to great upset). The reason why we disclose certain things about sex doesn't come from our own philosophy, it comes from our own sense of what the other party would find to be crucial to their decision. The reason why people call something like this rape is because of the sociopathic lack of empathy which leads you to withhold things you have a lot of reason to believe the other party would find crucial to their decision of consent. Rape isn't about whether you think it's reasonable that a fact makes a person withdraw their consent, it's simply about the fact that they did. What you disclose should not, responsibly, come from what YOU think is important. It should come from what you think is likely to impact the other party's decision of consent. And, even among those accepting of transgenders, accepting transgenders in your personal sexual/romantic preferences as their target gender is still extremely contentious and sensitive, which means that it's something that matters to many/most people's decision of consent so you should tell a person if you want to respect consent. Even if you didn't want to respect consent, we see examples like this where, even though the murderer was wrong, we know that it's a severe enough factor that it greatly upsets people, so telling people can help defuse situations like this earlier to create less danger for transgender people.

> And besides that, this isn't rape

It is rape in the many jurisdictions and philosophies in which deceiving a person counts as rape. It's rape in the same sense that it's rape for your spouses twin to have sex with you while you thought it was your spouse. But it's not productive to get into a battle of semantics about whether you feel like granting people the right to use a word you use a different way. Calling it rape is recognition of the manipulation that got a person to have sex in a scenario they would not consensually have had sex in and which, consequently is emotionally scarring. Regardless of whether you use the word rape, the MEANING as described there is important. This man was led to have sex in a situation in which he would not have given consent. That is a very bad thing to do to a person.

> and this woman was murdered and in a thread about a woman being MURDERED, here k am having to go through and fucking remind people ""hey let's not blame the murder victim,""

1. The reason why we're talking less about the murder is because everybody agrees that the murder was wrong and bad, while the role of the transgender person's action is more contentious.
2. It's an intellectually backward strategy to pretend the world is so black and white that being a victim exempts a person from fault. If an angry guy with a knife walks by and you say, ""Hey fker, come at me!"" and then they stab you, yes they are at fault and clearly unstable and dangerous, but we're still allowed to criticize you for doing something that clearly set them off. More importantly, it's the most productive and realistic response to try to find out what about what you did contributed to the outcome because that's the easiest thing we can change to improve people's safety. Mentally unstable people are always going to be mentally unstable, but we can have the sensitivity to recognize how we can behave ourselves to be the safest and be the least likely to create hostile situations. The same applies to this case. The murderer obviously had an overreaction that hints at mental instability, but there is no evidence that that reaction would have occurred without the instigation by the trans person. Regardless of what is fair, if we want people to be safe, we should recognize that and understand the importance of sharing this kind of detail. Rather than ignoring the repeated evidence that many people consider this being raped and would be greatly upset by it, we should take that to heart to realize that it is indeed an important thing to mention in our society and something that is extremely important to many people.

> ""Hey, please stop misgendering the murder victim,""

Your statement here suggests that you believe the notion of misgendering is objectively right. The notion of misgendering and the ability to change your gender is an opinion. Not everybody shares the opinion that gender is distinct from sex and that you are permitted to choose a new gender. It's not an objective matter. The fact that dysphoria occurs is kind of proven, but that doesn't tell us how to actually respond or represent gender, it just tells us that some people feel dysphoria. So, essentially, get off your high horse. You have a valid opinion. Other people have a valid opinion that the trans person here is still a man. ""Misgendering"" is a condescendingly non-productive remark."

"> No, we aren't. The best minds in election modeling agree that she's an incredibly strong candidate. All polling data suggests she handily bests just about every Republican candidate.

How can you put such faith in election matchups right now (and then proceed to be a condescending ass about it)? Such polls mean fuck all until primary season. As it stands, relatively few people are paying attention right now. Clinton has a large lead due to name recognition, but in nearly every poll I've seen she is trending downward. While her lead is still massive, the fact that her support keeps going down this early on is extremely worrying to me, and until she can stabilize those numbers you will not be able to convince me that she is a strong candidate.

> No, they really don't. We've already seen their arguments against her. They've been trying to hammer her for years in the hopes of nipping her candidacy in the bud. She came out the other side no worse for wear.

No, we have not, at least not to the extent we will see them come election time. I'm not sure what you mean by ""came out the other side"", since she hasn't really been in the national spotlight before this year besides being selected as Secretary of State. The one time she had her presidential mettle tested, she was defeated by a relatively unknown and inexperienced senator from Illinois. People have assumed that she would be the next President ever since she lost the nomination in 2008, but so far the Republicans haven't really had a chance to put together their greatest hits of Clinton's failures, and that is something that many undecideds won't just brush off as propaganda.

I'm assuming you are a Democrat, or at least vote consistently to the left. If so, it really doesn't matter what you or I think, because in the end it is swing voters that decide the election. Sanders' biggest obstacle is name recognition, something that will be fixed should he get the nomination. Clinton's biggest obstacle is that many people do not like her and do not trust her, and that is going to work against her when people who aren't voting just to keep the GOP out of office go to the polls. Have we ever elected someone that had a higher disapproval rating going into office? Keep in mind that there are still many speeches and public appearances to go, and if these past [two] ( http  appearances are any indication, I really don't have very much confidence in Clinton winning over people who aren't already Democrats."

">you need scientific proof to believe something, yet when it comes to an immeasurable thing such as brain chemistry, you swallow psychiatry's speculation whole.

No, I need good reasons and evidence. I have those. Brain chemistry is not immeasurable. Psychiatry, psychology and neurology are all interlinked sciences with thousands of supporting articles of research.

>Come on, my boy, think harder.

You are hilarious. Seriously, if you want to be condescending, you're doing a piss poor job of it. Get your shit together, kid. (That's how to be condescending properly, incidentally). While I'm at it, you're a fucking writer? Give me a break. How many copies of your shit book could you possibly have sold when this is the best your prose gets? Jesus Christ, man.

>I’m wondering if you have even a rudimentary understanding of how psychiatry came to be?

Yep. It doesn't matter how it came to be, though. It matters what it is. You mention flaws in previous sciences, but that doesn't have much to do with this. People thought the earth was flat. That doesn't mean geology isn't a real science. People thought we were the only galaxy in the universe within the lifetime of people that are still alive. That doesn't invalidate cosmology.

You're also ignoring the vast amount of research that has been done on the brain itself to understand mental disorders, which is an odd thing to ignore. Regardless, even if psychiatry is full of faults (I won't claim that it is or isn't; my claim is that you're full of shit), that doesn't change the fact that your original claim is that chemical imbalances don't exist.

>You say show me the evidence… and that’s what I’m saying to you.

Wikipedia and those sources are a great place to start.

>Psychiatry is not a real science

According to the definition of science, it is.

>Once we develop a measuring stick that we can dip into the brain and return measurable results, then we should discuss labeling things as balanced or imbalanced...

Analyzing people with healthy brains (and the properties of healthy brains, like healthy minds) is an imperfect method of understanding brain chemistry, I agree. It's the best we have, however, and there are very good reasons to believe that an organ that relies entirely on chemicals can have chemical imbalances. By introducing chemicals into one's system, we've achieved positive results. People have been treated for depression with medicine; medicine that was made by predictions of psychiatry, psychology and neurology.

Regardless, you've entirely dodged my question.

>“The majority of scientists disagree with you” Bullshit. Now you’re making claims you can’t back up. Show me this scientific consensus you speak of. You can’t. The best you’ll be able to do is gather a bunch of psychiatrists (not scientists) who are all guessing at the same thing.

The wiki article's I've linked should be sufficient. The criticism area might be of special interest to you, though it's outdated. There are cases where mental illness has been diagnosed in individuals who are merely unusual (though their reason for being unusual would come down to brain chemistry just like anyone else), but you'll notice there is essentially no contemporary criticism of it; at least, none that's taken seriously.

>“The mind is a product of the brain.” I disagree. I don’t really want to get into this because I suspect you don’t believe that human beings have souls or energies or whatever.

Oh good, I thought I was going to have to trick you into admitting this, but you just came out with it. You're right, I don't, and the reason I don't is because there is no supporting science for this claim. There is no evidence of it. There are no good reasons to believe it.

Do I need to point out the irony of you shitting on psychiatry as ""not real science"" then coming out telling me you believe in souls?

>To me, the mind (which I suppose means the entirety of your thoughts) is a product of every molecule in the body.

I'm sure you have really good reasons for believing that, too.

> And yes, of course, yoga, meditation, what foods you put in your body, etc. all affects the mind. There is endless science showing how behavior affects the mind.

I explicitly said this was true. You explicitly said chemical imbalances are a myth. You have no good reason to believe this. I mean, come on, is fucking alcohol not proof enough that chemistry can affect the way you think? So if your brain is producing too much or too little of some chemical, maybe it'll fuck you up?

> Sure… the advice to take control of your well being by living a healthy, mindful existence is really bad advice, right? Wait… what? No, chucklefuck (to use one of your very diplomatic terms)… doing yoga, eating healthy, being mindful… these things can have nothing but positive results in people’s lives.

I didn't say don't do them. You implied that's all you needed. Do I need to go back and link what you actually fucking said? If you're going to make claims, either stand by then or admit you were wrong. Don't do this half-ass bullshit.

You said chemical imbalances are a myth, which necessarily means that those who do suffer from this, with severe depression or the myriad of other conditions that can result from fucked up brain chemistry, who take your advice seriously, are not going to seek medical treatment. They're going to eat apples and stand on their head.

I agree. Misdiagnosing is a problem. Over-diagnosing is a problem. If we're going to agree that there are mental disorders that can be fixed with medicine, then what the fuck are we still talking about? You're the one that said they couldn't.

Unless you think pills have souls and energy and shit, and it's not chemistry that helps people.

Have we not eaten while another starved? Will you punish us for that? Will you reward us for the virtue of starving while others ate? No man earns punishment, no man earns reward.

>Again, intermarriage isn't exactly what most people would call genocide.

Ah, so it wasn't genocidal when the Native Americans interbred with Europeans, even though it was voluntary? You would tell the Native Americans not to worry about their dwindling numbers and their children marrying off the Europeans instead of their own people, causing their numbers to shrink?

What if the Europeans also made propaganda aimed at convincing the Native Americans to marry Europeans, with the intent of eliminating them?

What if the Europeans forcibly ""diversified"" Native American reservations by moving European settlers onto the reservations, so that the interbreeding would be more likely to occur?

What if the Europeans raised the Native Americans in schools that taught them that it is dangerous and immoral for them to see themselves as a ""tribe"", demoralizing them?

Still not genocide? You'd be fine if this was done to Native Americans with the intent of making them disappear in a few generations?

>Moreover, you need to explain how collective identity is relevant to morality. Morality is about conscious suffering and well-being, and science provides no evidence that groups are conscious entities capable of experiencing suffering.

That doesn't prove that homosexual lobbyists forced psychiatry to change against its will. Just because people did make protests does not mean that they have controlled all of psychiatry for the last 49 years. If you thought people falsely considered you to be mentally ill, then you'd be angrily protesting as well. Just imagine the riots that there would be if the DSM listed religion as a mental illness! 

The book even mentions that psychiatrists were already considering removing homosexuality as a mental illness before the protests began. Homosexuality is not considered a mental illness today because there is no empirical evidence that it is harmful or disordered. It was merely assumed to be mental illness based on societal standards regarding heterosexuality. 

Still not relevant to your mistreatment of otherkin. 

>What you're not seeing correlation with, just reread and think about it in context

>Sorry, forcing someone to be involved in a ceremony they don't want to is not live and let live.

Still not relevant to otherkin. Also, no one is being forced to be ""involved"" in a ceremony in any sense of the word. They are required to sell cakes to the public, and to not discriminate based on sex, race, or sexuality. That's it. They are required to live and let live, and because they couldn't do that they were fined. 

>wouldn't expect a print shop run by lesions to print materials for a pro traditional marriage rally. 

Becuause a ""pro-marriage rally"" is not a protected class. They also aren't required to support a Neo-Nazi rally. However, they could not choose to refuse to print Christian documents just because the people requesting them are Christian, since religion is a protected class. 

>Just a lack of common respect and sense.

They went to a bakery and ordered a wedding cake for their wedding. The cake had nothing homosexual on it. It was a perfectly reasonable request that was refused for illegal reasons.

I never said or implied that. At all. I even said otherkin were weird. I said that they are hurting no one, and you are being agressive, rude, and spreading lies about them just because you think they're ""ridiculous"". That's my problem here. You're lying about them and insulting them just because you think they're wrong, and not from anything they've done or even could do. 

And no one is talking about men claiming to be 7 year old girls.

>I have 2 cats, neither use a toilet. If a person says they're a cat and society is aS insane as the mad hatters tea party, public litter boxes are not out of the question

Your cats are not otherkin. Otherkin recognize that they are biologically human. They use toilets, brush their teeth, drive cars, get married, and have careers, just like other humans. Just because they feel like they were born as the wrong species does not mean that they think they're required to act like their ""true"" species for no reason. 

Look, this would be like me claiming that all public buildings are going to be forced to install extra-wide doorways to accommodate Christians carrying literal crosses around. I mean, their Bible clearly commands them to do it! And if our society is so insane that we'll tolerate crazy people who believe that God is wine and crackers and that He wants us to eat Him like cannibals, then where will it stop?!

All of that is completely false, obviously. But an outsider with a negative bias towards Christians and no personal experience in actually talking to them could easily believe it. That's what you're doing to otherkin. "

The fiction she writes is not for erotic purposes. She doesn't write sex scenes. She doesn't write things for the sake of people to masturbate to them. She doesn't write for the sake of money, but for the sake of reviews to better herself as a writer and for the sake of interacting with human beings. In fact, she can't really write for the sake of money. If she were audited, given she is a pensioner, then she would likely lose the government income she receives. 

A government income that, only because of the rent control on the place she lives, is barely enough for groceries and rent and utilities each month leaving her little to nothing to put in savings for possible large purchases in the future, like a new motherboard for her computer, or a new modem, etc. She could not live on ""a couple of hundred extra bucks a month."" She does not write for the sake of money, and likely could not support herself from just writing smutty e-books. Especially considering the fact that one health issue is slowly strangling the nerves to her dominant hand, causing constant pain, and reducing mobility. 

Think the symptoms of carpal tunnel + the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, but in all 4 of her ball and socket joints with a constant degradation of her condition and no hope of treatment because the doctors won't give her the time of day. And if one GP DOES order even an X-ray, it could take months before she has the test done, it could come up inconclusive, and the results could get buried in a medical file thicker than the skulls, or the stone hearts, of many of the people who have posted on this thread such that the next doctor will ignore the results and order a new set of tests that will take another few months to finally have done.

"> Were you expecting your stupid, horridly unbalanced ideas to make it into the game? It's apparent a lot of gamers aren't good game designers. Early access is not a pedestal for you to spew out your awful ideas and expect them all to be taken seriously.

> I don't know why you expect to be involved with literally everything. TWI did not release early access for you to be their head game designer. They released early access so the player base could help balance the overall game, and they are. If TWI wanted your input on game design, they'd ask.

Aside the condescending tone, it seems that you do not realize the many issues with the gameplay (not perk balance, gameplay mechanics themselves). It looks like you really think that TWI know what they're doing. Well they probably do to a large extent, no question about that, but there are also some blatant gameplay issues that most HoE players are aware of, and yet TWI seems to either not be aware or to just ignore it, because the ""solutions"" that we get aren't ones or are bad ones at any rate.

Let's just to give one example: we have only one single tool against Scrakes, and that is the EMP. That's why it's used over and over, and will probably keep being used over and over forever. And because the game is basically Scrake Surival Simulator 2015, it's an important issue. Now my guess is that this isn't how TWI see things, from their perspective they are probably adding many tools to help against Scrakes, just look at the Demo, he has a skill that increases stumbles and knockdowns. Well whatever TWI think that stumbles and knockdowns do, they don't help against Scrakes, they do just the opposite and make them even harder.

My guess is that future updates won't address this particular example that I've given, not even the Sharpshooter that many people talk about like of the messiah, because unless some very surprising and welcome changes happen, you'd still need the EMP for Sharpshooter to be any useful at all.

Now why is it like that? Maybe TWI are perfectly aware of it, and maybe they even intended it and designed it this way, that would be pretty sad though because having one single tool being used over and over isn't interesting. Or maybe they do have other interesting alternatives to EMP in the works for future updates, it's possible, and if it's the case well thanks for letting us in the dark for so long, we have no other choice but to complain in the meantime. And finally the last alternative is that TWI are clueless, that they didn't even think the EMP would be used against Scrakes like it is, they just intended the EMP to be a kind of ""damn that Scrake is raged, let me throw an EMP to win some time and distance myself"", and that they don't have any other useful tools against Scrakes in the work, and if we end up getting some in the future they will probably work just by design accident kinda like the EMP.

Now I'm not saying that the third alternative is true, and if it is, it's probably only partially true, they are probably aware of this blatant issue by now. But if it is, why would that be, how did we get there in the first place and how can it be changed? I don't know, maybe because they're pretty bad at their own game as can be easily seen from their own gameplay footage (I heard that they don't even beat HoE themselves?), or maybe because they're just bad game designers (which I highly doubt, they're overall doing a mostly fine job)... But these kind of issues wouldn't pop up if they kept in touch with the HoE community and listened to our feedback, because there's a few of such issues and they're pretty well known to players."

">Batman is allowed to operate as a vigilante because he works with the GCPD.

>He's not the judge, jury and executioner...he makes sure the criminals he catches go through the legal system.

Batman could operate without working with GCPD. He’s the Batman for a reason. He doesn’t wait for police to come before arriving on a scene or waits to stop criminals until after the cops come.

I agree he’s not judge, jury, and executioner, and it’s noble that he does try the go through the justice system. Although realistically that system doesn’t work when you deal with criminals the level of the Joker. How many times does he break out? Or use people like Harleen to do his bidding even when locked up? I’ve said before that Batman shouldn’t be actively looking to hunt the Joker but In a case where the Joker makes him choose between an innocent life and the Joker Batman shouldn’t hesitate to kill Joker.

>I don't think you understand the meaning of ""ethical"".

So it wouldn’t be ethical for society to execute some like Stalin, Hitler, etc?

>Shouldn't the decision to kill him be left to the courts?

Sure if the justice system works.

>Do you want Batman to be an executioner?

Never said I did. I just want him to choose an innocent life over the life of a criminal.

>If he kills the Joker, why stop there?

Do all police officers go on a killing spree after killing a criminal?

>Why not kill every criminal/villain that puts lives in danger?

Because not every criminal commits the same level of crime. 

>Truly a slippery slope.

Sure but Batman doesn’t lack common sense and would know the difference between killing someone so volatile and poisonous to society to someone who commits a crime like robbery.

>Batman has the money, tech, training and experience to avoid killing...so why shouldn't he do it?

He should always pursue that avenue except realistically there will be several times where a criminal can get the better of him and force him into a catch 22 situation.

>If the GCPD had the means to capture criminals without killing them...they would use it in a heart beat (mainly to avoid lawsuits lol).

Right I don’t understand the character even though I’ve read numerous comics, watched every Batman media I could get my hands on, and all because I think that if push comes to shove Batman should choose an innocent life over the likes of someone like Joker. Yeah that seems like a fair statement to me. As a general rule, he shouldn’t kill, that doesnt mean you cant make an interesting story around the fact he does if push comes to shove. "

No, they're 'held up' by virtue of the Earth's curvature. Nothing actually holds them up, and a sideways push can't create an upward force.

Accelerative forces only add to the direction of application, and objects in the absence of a force move in a straight line, at constant velocity, forever.

The force of gravity actually pulls things inwards, towards the Earth's centre of mass. You fall inwards, and as you've implied downwards is relative. The object definitely falls inwards for reasons already explained.

> Where are you getting this from?

Oh wait I see. Another dubious study. Did you read it? Now we're going to declare that men don't take care of their families as much as women based on what 12 guys said. Very quickly here are the problems with this study:

1. They only quantify housework as their main metric of value. I would argue that a lot more than cooking and cleaning the house goes into providing for a family. Men typically do most of the physically demanding and mechanical work around the house. When something goes bump in the night, it's usually the man who has to go investigate. These activities also contribute to the families well being. So the study is biased by not taking these other activities into account, but rather only valuing traditionally female activities such as cooking and cleaning.

2. They stacked the deck against males. They asked 36 women and 12 men subjective questions about their partners. Which way do you suspect the responses will skew?

3. 12 men participated. Again, at what point do you discount the survey results? 5 men? 3 perhaps?

> If you want to compare two groups it very much matters how many observations there are in each group.

Agreed. See point 2 and 3 above. You still didn't give me a number though. I'd like to pin this down. It shouldn't be that hard I would think since you are firmly confident that 22 women speak for all college students. I'm just curious where the cutoff is.

> The point wasn't that it was a rational response.

So lets back up then. Do you wish to cater to and shape policy around what a bunch of irrational people believe? How do we address the issues of all the people who feel strongly that vaccines are harmful or that global warming is a myth?

> This goes back to her comment about having a public and private persona. I don't think this is actually a problem. It's part of being a politician.

Pandering to popular opinions only appears not to be a problem in this case because I suspect you believe that gay marriage is a good thing. It certainly is a problem if the popular thinking is that Jews are undesirable. Put quite simply, and I suspect you would agree, that politicians are by their very nature a problem. We need good leaders, not good politicians. We need people who have a consistent logical process whereby they come to decisions and if warranted, reverse their positions based on reason, not leaders who blow where the winds of popular opinion lead merely so they can acquire power.

When people came to the Maidan, they proudly asserted a dissociation from party politics because each party had its respective history of disillusionment. This is not the same thing as political apathy; an individual fighting for or against policy cannot by definition be apolitical.

"> In what ways Tron is supposedly warping the format around it?

It heavily incentivizes racing.

The verdict is still out as to whether this thing with Teferi is here to stay (remember when Nahiri came out and Control was suddenly playable and then two months later it wasn't?) It's why you'll see Mardu Pyromancer rise and decline in accordance to Humans' performance, because it benefited mainly from that deck's large meta presence.

It's almost like we're not as efficient at turning grass into sources of energy, which is why we don't stand around fucking eating grass all day.

And if we were to get rid of all that grass and cut down trees to put into place large farms with crop rotations so the soil doesn't get depleted, and spray pesticides so the food isn't eaten by insects and etc etc etc, we'd take up more space than the initial farm did. That's how it dehabitates wildlife you moronic pedant.

>hunting isn't a big deal to me at all, 1) because hunters generally as far as i'm aware make sure the animal doesn't suffer (unlike what is done to cattle on farms, because it's cheaper and less work to do the bare minimum for it to be sanitary / reach a certain quality until they're ready to be killed)

You really haven't ever worked with livestock have you? And you must be painfully unaware of trapping.

>hunters aren't purposely breeding animals just to kill

Ah yes, domestication is terribly terribly evil. animals couldn't possibly have relatively decent lives under beings that take care of them, up until they're quickly and painlessly slaughtered

>If you eat meat you either kill them or fund killing them, end of story.

And you don't understand how you're not making a value judgement about others based on this? You are equating eating meat to being a terrible person. Good job.

>no he poked them! wow! that's so much worse than killing them!

">technologically illiterate teenagers

And this is where the argument fails. Your condescending attitude towards people who aren't into technology the same way you are is why Apple is succeeding more and more. They are making products that the average schmoe — who don't want to upgrade their hardware or hack into files — can use intuitively. Case in point — the story of the 100 year old woman whose first computer is an iPad.

I am admittedly a hardcare Apple fan and I've switched my entire family over to Macs and iPhones and iPads. I lend support to my 68 year-old mother-in-law who has had zero issues learning the Mac, my tech-wary 70 year-old father who has thrived on the Mac, my VHS-tape watching sister who now makes videos for her classroom on her Mac, etc. They thank me all the time and they went from being afraid of PCs to using their computers in ways they never thought they would.

">I've already given you the context. The fact that you reject this context because you disagree with it doesn't mean that the context ceases to apply.

Hogwash. You simply said it is within the realm of possibility that a supernatural being created us. I even went so far as to agree a BEING that is natural (for how else would they interact with a natural world?) and created us is a possibility. I don't believe it, but it is certainly possible, no?

>The proof is there. You just reject it. 

No proof. Subjective experiences do NOT account for objective reality when it comes to god no matter how badly you want it to be true.

>People can give you countless experiences of the supernatural. The information is out there and the stories are numerous. The problem is that you'd reject this because ""there must be another explanation"" or ""it's just coincidence"" or some other reasoning.

I reject it right now because the definition of supernatural, indeed God itself, is so different to so many different people that it is essentially nonsensical to pinpoint. Sure, in conversations with a person or persons limited to a few or in a spirited debate one could define these concepts and run with them... but you'll still have to do this for every conversation because there isn't a standard to bear. You may as well say ""Something"" instead of God and it would apply all the same.

And, you are correct. I would largely discount those stories because human beings are incredibly irrational. Our minds are beautiful at filling in holes in stories - I'd say a very defining characteristic of our species is the inborn curiosity that drives us to understand ourselves and our universe. Out of that curiosity came explanations for reality that were, at the time, inexplicable. The sun was Apollo; hybrids of creatures born out of imagination became a pantheon; God is love and genocidal. The list goes on and on and on...

... but it's far, far more likely that people are simply creating the reality they wish to experience because the thought of not being born of purpose is frightening.

Anyway, your assertion is laughable. There is no such evidence and if it were verifiable you would make me a believer.

I'll end it with this:

I hope that your beliefs bring you sincere joy but I implore you to stop acting like you somehow have a monopoly on truth because it's condescending and arrogant, particularly when those beliefs create great harm to society through their judgments on others.

"> The relevant concept is known as the lesser evil.

There's no need to be condescending, especially when it's not even actually relevant. Was Labour a marginally better option for working class people? most likely yes. But elections don't work by getting people to vote for you just because when all the crap is put on the scales your pile is the one that weighs a little bit less.

You either need to convince the voters that you are a positively good option for them (like the SNP in Scotland, or the LibDems in 2010), or that even if you aren't ideal you are truly the least worst option when the worst one is truly awful (which is what the Conservatives managed to for a lot of people who didn't love them but thought that Labour would wreck the economy).

Labour at best was ""not the Conservatives"" and neither its propaganda nor that of its supporters demonized the Conservatives to nearly the same degree that Labour was demonized. Even if you think that voters should be responsible for getting off their asses and picking the lesser evil, you must recognize that it's a party's job to mobilize its voters, and Labour clearly failed in that regard."

This is unnecessarily condescending and dismissive. I don't want to antagonize you, so I'll politely ask instead: what exactly did I ignore? 

I gave a (what I thought to be) well-reasoned account of what the story did well. I was pretty much up front with my belief that worldbuilding doesn't really matter too much to me. As in, I agree with the complaints of worldbuilding, but --- this is my personal stance on storytelling --- it's less important to me why the Valla curse exists as opposed to how it's used in the story, and it served its job well. I can get into it more in general if you want, but the Valla example gets the point across, I think.

I've been the first to admit that I completely forgot about the Anthony arc. Totally a fair criticism both of my post and of Revelation. 

Finally, I want to give a gentle reminder that just because someone praises something you dislike doesn't mean they do so out of ignorance.

">We are all on the economic ship, when it stalls we all stall, when it sinks, we all sink. 

Not really true.

First of all the ""ship"" hasn't ""sunk""... rather it has taken on a lot of water. People on the upper decks (in terms of net assets, rather than just net income) are above the water line; and many of them have (wisely) prepared ""lifeboats"". 

Now if the ship actually DOES sink... even the people with the lifeboats will suffer (they'll live, just not as well).

The problem is that the current government policies tend to be more about pumping water from one flooded compartment into another flooded compartment -- creating a false illusion of ""dry"" compartments (at the expense of flooding/drowning people in other compartments) -- and less about actually bailing the water OUT of the ship much less patching the plethora of holes in the hull.

">Have you heard of Standard Oil or Bell Telephone? Standard Oil alone enjoyed nearly two decades of monopoly before the Federal government had to invent anti-trust legislation for the purpose of shutting it down.

ACTUALLY, the statute used to break up Standard Oil was created in 1890, 20 years prior to antitrust litigation being brought against it. So, that point is wrong.

And really, you've got the whole problem of monopolies backward because of your misunderstanding of the problem. What did Standard Oil do? They were the largest refiner of petroleum, and they cornered the market on kerosene. But the interesting thing that people do not ever discuss about Standard Oil is that the price for kerosene dramatically fell because of their economies of scale. And yet, they were still able to reap massive profits while providing the consumer with cheap oil. Such a horrible company, indeed.

Also, your mention of AT&T requires some nuance as well. From 1875-1895, AT&T owned the patent on telephones, granted by the government, giving them a legally created monopoly that they wouldn't have enjoyed otherwise. And indeed, after their patent expired, the number of new phones in the US dramatically increased with more companies being allowed into the market. AT&T fought this extremely hard, and by 1913 they were given the go ahead by the government to create a cartel. Then in WWI, the telephones were nationalized under AT&T control, and in 1934 the FCC gave AT&T the monopoly on interstate telephony. This is documented here.

Also, like I said in my previous post, please read Gabriel Kolko's Triumph of Conservatism, which shows that the monopolistic companies could not actually create monopolies without government assistance because technology and new companies always thwart monopoly because of the diseconomies of scale that makes large firms unable to effectively compete against newer companies.

The original Community Reinvestment Act or its strengthening under Bill Clinton had nothing to do with an increase in loans? Bill Clinton's insistence to Fannie and Freddie to decrease loan standards had nothing to do with the mortgage securitization market? George W Bush's ""homeownership society"" was just a fluke?

Your analysis of the creation of the derivatives market is as fact-free as your knowledge of monopolies is. But I digress.

Thank you for condescendingly explaining something I clearly know better than you do. 

For something to be benevolent sexism it needs to rest on and reinforce the same ideas that provoke hostile sexism. It needs to be limiting but at the same time be easy to lap up and make the victim more docile and susceptible to hostile sexism. Most of all, it needs to have a hostile sexism counterpart that works jointly with it and cripples the victim's social standing.

""Men are great leaders"" serves the literal opposite purpose. Leadership gives social status and influence. You really are ignorant.

Back to my dick pass example; if that was sexism it would keep men from positions of power because they are too easily influenced (HS); while not punishing them for being easily influenced (BS). Men would be rewarded for lowering their inhibitions (BS) because it reaffirms the stereotype (HS). Likewise if wanted to overcome the prejudice he would have to be a literal poker face 24/7 which would carry social penalties because he'd be acting ""unmanly"" and ""like a freak"".

"You clearly don't understand the significance of Moore's law. Yes, it may have become self-fulfilling prophecy due to the use of exponential projections in project planning and development, but the very fact that this is possible is of huge import. You claim it only applies to transistor number, and yet it has applied to a variety of technologies. Processing speed, memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras all have increased at roughly exponential rates (thanks, Wikipedia). Add to that genomic sequencing and genomic synthesis - the exponential phenomenon is hitting biology in a big way. The biologists leading this revolution talk of leveraging the power of computation and digital technology to bring exponential growth in technology to biological problems.

By claiming that Moore's law, which is essentially the observation of exponential growth of technology, is meaningless, you only prove your ignorance. If it was only transistors that would be one thing, but there are too many examples of exponential growth in an array of digital technologies to say that there is no such phenomenon.

>Magical, fairy governmental data

Look at the Total Information Awareness project and tell me that modern governments don't have this data. Again, you only prove your ignorance.

If you think it is difficult to process this data, you would be correct - if you think it is impossible to process this data, you would be wrong.

Billions of genes? We have 25,000 genes; even with 100,000 alleles for every gene you only get to 2.5 billion genes, and this is still readily amenable to current processing technology. You can even try to think about including splicing, multiplying it up to trillions of genes, and we still have the computational ability to tackle the problem. A beowulf cluster of 100 machines, are you really that stupid? Try supercomputers with hundreds of thousands of cores, capable of petaflops. If these are already available at public universities, you really think that our military doesn't have a few? Your ignorance is astounding!

As for the correlation between various genetic profiles and its relationship to intelligence, once target genes have been identified this will require a few decades of cell and animal work before it becomes reasonable to design selective breeding programs. Still, the animal work has already begun - I recently read a paper in which a specific protein known to differentiate humans from all other primates that is implicated in speech development, and they've spliced it into mice. This work is crude at best, but it's already started. Amusingly, I was a subject of Duke TIP, a program that seeks to identify those with outstanding intelligence. A recent study collected our genetic information to correlate genes with intelligence... I sent off DNA samples a year ago after scoring in the top 1% of every standardized test I've ever taken.

As for whether people like it, sometimes people have no choice, as in China. Other governments might use IVF and surrogate mothers, technology already commercially available and that can be done completely via economic incentives. There would be some public pushback at the point this became public knowledge, but all our leaders would have to do is claim that the enemy of the day had a similar program and we must not allow ourselves to fall behind. People can be made to fall in line, just look at modern American politics.

Fermat's last theorem was a very difficult question and was solved through the collaborative efforts of hundreds if not thousands of intelligent individuals over hundreds of years, in some cases leveraging modern technology - this is a poster child for the sort of problem that would benefit from a billion geniuses cranking away at it. As for answering the question of gravity, this is a fundamentally hard question, similar to asking about consciousness or the origin of the universe. We might discover the hypothesized gravitons soon, but I don't think so.

>Creating a billion super intelligent robots will only give you complex science with more questions...

Our current society, with billions of regular Joes led by a relatively few intelligent folk, can already improve technology exponentially. Assuming each of these robots is the equivalent of a Newton or an Einstein and they are allowed to interface with each other to ask and answer questions and direct technological development, I can't begin to imagine what they might create. You are correct that making them clonal would be problematic in terms of their ability to think outside the box, as they would be thinking outside the box in the same manner, but there is no reason other than a lack of creativity to assume that a technology capable of creating human AI would be unable to create multiple diverse human AI.

You perhaps hate the current Singularity nuts who maintain we'll be downloading our consciousness to computers within our lifetime. I too think this is crap, and the technological progression I laid out occurs over the next century or two, not over the next few decades. I simply don't think that we're currently smart enough to generate human AI, which requires a very thorough and fundamental of human intelligence that we clearly lack. The beauty of statistics and correlation is that we can manipulate intelligence before we understand it to create outliers, hence why I believe we will create super-intelligent people before we create human-level AI.

>remove every bit of your comedy relief out of the video (including interactions between the two) and see what you have left. It should flow fairly well and the information should seem smoothly delivered. 

what you would have left is basically Session 6. the flow and delivery is very smooth which is why i used it's script as a basis for Session 7's. and tbh, if you remove yanush from session 7, the flow of information in Session 7 is better than Session 6.

Moreover, prosecution needs the approval of the Attorney General.

Nothing is ""getting me in trouble"" here. You're just refusing to accept simple logic. And doing so in as condescending a tone as possible, might I ad. Which is hilarious when you're as dead wrong about everything as you are. (This is me talking like you. :D I'll be continuing it for the rest of this post just to give you a little look in the mirror. Enjoy that.)

You absolutely need defined mechanics when the ability you're working with depends on them to function, genius. That is the point of hax. To use those mechanics to work around normal defenses. If they didn't do that, then they wouldn't BE hax. 

So, no, we'll do the exact same thing with your snack cake power that we do with every other power and evaluate it to the best of our abilities. No one will dispute that it does what it does. But without knowing how it does what it does, you can't begin to apply it to an opponent because you won't be able to tell if there is any applicable defense for it. You know why we do that? To prevent NLFs. You know, those things you keep desperately trying to accuse me of using when I've done nothing but try to take them out of the equation? Meanwhile you're doing nothing but encouraging them on both sides of this argument? Yeah, those. 

>would mean that whether the attack or defense prevails depends entirely on which debater speaks first.

Ugh, god. Why does it not surprise me that you can't even grasp simple logic? Let me spell it out for you in baby words since big boy words are beyond you for now. 
It doesn't matter who asks first, champ. 

""Me punch ghost!"" 
""No, I be no-touchy! (That's intangible, for the adults in the audience.) 
""Oh no! Me no can punch!""

Well, would you look at that?!
Even though the attacker asked first, it was the defender who prevailed! Amazing. But wait, there's more! 

""Me have feats of punching no-touchies with me Magic Fists!"" 
""Oh no! Me can be touchy!""

It goes back and forth until you find the truth. I know that's a foreign concept for you, but it is generally what we look for around here. Please considering leaving if it doesn't agree with you. VSBattleWiki is thataway. I hear they're more accepting of your kind. (Oh, god this is disgusting. How much longer do I have to do this? Ugh.) 

But that wasn't even what I was talking about. My first claim comes with its own proof in the form of its feats and the details of its mechanics. Now, I try to apply it to my opponent's character based on my belief that he satisfies the conditions for it to work. There's my burden, chief. It's right there from the start. Next, it is said opponent's turn to see those conditions, use their knowledge of the character and determine whether or not any of them are a bad fit for them. If they can, then it doesn't work and the ball is back to my court to find fault with their argument. If I can't, it stands. If I can, it goes back over to them. Facts don't change based on who says them first. 

>Not how it works, buddy. You logic has to be consistent. You can just throw it out when it leads to an obviously absurd result and still have it hold true for every other case. 

My logic is consistent. You're just trying to ignore it by applying it to a being who defies logic by definition. Say, maybe that's why you refuse to go anywhere near logic. God complex much? 

Your OPM comments aren't even worth dignifying with response. It's a comedic parody of actual shonen, nothing more. Unless you're dumb enough to believe in the meteor durability/lightspeed mosquito. 

>They've shown the exact opposite. They've showing that they have abilities that are not compatible with normal human physiology. 

Proof? Just because you can do something normal humans can't do doesn't mean you stop functioning completely the same way humans do. Frickin' Yamcha at this Namek point is far tougher than a normal human and can channel a fictional power no human could. Amazingly enough, he still needs to breathe. Only when you show me a feat that he is now no longer bound by those constraints will I have any reason to believe he would stop being susceptible to things that exploit them. Call me when he gets the same operation you did where he gets a second set of lungs implanted in is lower body so he can breathe and talk out his backside. 

>Him being physiologically normal in other way isn't. Goku has also drunken the super-holy water, a poison that killed everyone else that had tried to drink it before him, and survived. There's that ""evidence"" thing rearing its ugly head again.

So what? Explain to me how his physiology is different. Immune to a really strong poison or something? Great. You can use that defend him against people saying their character poisons him. 

Funny how this different physiology didn't protect him from heart disease. Oh, that's right. He's got a heart that appears to function like a human's. Guess that's explicitly the same too, opening him up to being killed by the Death Note's heart attack...attack (pending human/mortal translation argument; see top comment in thread), among others. 

>You keep doing this thing where you admit that you're wrong when having your logic applied to a specific example, without every imagining that maybe your logic is flawed .

This is it. The quintessential example of the pot calling the kettle black. It just doesn't get better than this, folks. Take pictures to commemorate the event. As someone who got to be part of it, I'll be selling autographs in the lobby. 

And no, I haven't once said I was wrong. Every single time you've argued against my examples you were actually FOLLOWING MY METHODOLOGY! I make a claim, you find an example against which that claim won't work! The problem is that you're trying to falsely apply it to all of fiction instead of only the specific situations to which it would apply. 

Look back at the alien brain chemistry thing. You didn't disprove it at all. The only thing you did was expand the list of targets against which it would not work by providing a good reason it wouldn't. That is all I'm saying you have to do with hax. See how it works to understand why it will or won't against the defenses a character has been shown to have. I don't understand how this is so hard for you to grasp. 
I will say now I absolutely did make a mistake in saying that pretty much only speed blitzing would counter it. I'm sure there are any number of other ways it can be countered since fiction is a big place. Though I would assume the readers understood those weren't going to be comprehensive lists in three small examples, which I explicitly referred to as ""just the short and dirty version for three of many, many other potential variations on just one type of power.""

>You even do it so blindly that you failed to notice that the example i give would also work against the first kind of TK since it's based in physical force, and moving fast through muscle power requires creating physical force.

That's because it wouldn't, O Wise One. Different brain chemistry, which is what your actually worthwhile counterexample was arguing about, has nothing to do with application of physical force against other parts of the body. Sure, you could speedblitz the user if you were faster than them and strong enough to take them down, as I said. But by all means, keep grasping at straws. 

>There has to be some kind of common metaphysical principle between the two, and there's no way that said principle can ever be proven to exist. Even the applying of force to molecules requires that the molecules be subject to whatever metaphysics allows the power to apply force to them.

Hmm. You know, that sounds amazingly like something else I heard recently. What was it...

>You're failing to understand one of the most basic rules of vs. forums, which is that, in order for two characters from different settings to interact at all, we have to grant a sort of general equivalence between their metaphysics.

Wow. It's almost like assuming that the atoms that make up a human in one universe function the same as the ones making up another human elsewhere until given some proof that they do not. There is your equivalence. Maybe now that it's in your own words, you'll actually try to pay attention to it. Gods know no one else's words are getting through that skull. 

>The interaction between powers from two different universes is always an assumption.

No one said it wasn't. Every battle on every board is nothing but assumptions supported as best as we can with feats and evidence. Or furious fanwank, in some cases. For them to interact at all, we assume the base worlds function similarly, that a human is a human until shown otherwise. That means if your hax targets something that doesn't exist in the opponent like Narutoverse chakra explicitly does, then it won't work. But it also means that if your human has shown the need to breathe, then hax that stop it will work unless further evidence to the contrary is included. 

Alright. I'm done talking like you right...--well, a version you that actually knows what it's talking about anyway--...now. I'm of a mind to report the both of us for this garbage. Ugh. I need a shower. "

> From the link you posted it says that DNA evidence shows that it could not have been them.

The link was a piece of fluff about Jackson's disgusting male-bonding sessions with a convicted rapist and murderer. With regards to the facts of the case, it has otherwise swallowed Jackson's lies about the ""innocence"" of these shitbags. 

A claim about DNA evidence, never presented in any court, was made by the Jackson legal team as part of the machinations to squeeze an Alford plea deal out of a newly appointed State's Attorney, years after 2 trials found the West Memphis 3 guilty, guilty, guilty. The defense claimed new DNA evidence to gain a new hearing, but then copped out of the hearing - and presenting said ""DNA evidence"" - with a sneaky Alford plea that the new SA (who was never involved in the original trials, and doubtless wanted nothing to do with it) fell for in the interests of clearing the revived case from his books. As such, the article is also wrong in asserting that they are ""innocent"" - legally they are still guilty. 

And factually they are guilty as well. Read this:  http

Second, you're acting as if the funding would come from the police budget. I never suggested that. I was advocating separation of powers which to any rational person would imply separation of budgets as well.

>You're also asking the police to give up chain of custody for potential evidence that is used by them to convict criminals and can be used against them in lawsuits.

Another straw-man argument. I never suggested any such thing. I only suggested that the data be stored by a third party. This could serve as evidence should a court decide it is necessary. I never suggested that a data storage facility should take part in the chain of custody. Only that the storage is not handled by police so that things don't easily ""get erased"".

Hence why I specified single-player content. Because it only involves a single player. See where I'm going with this?

>Not only that, this could be a very annoying issue for ground queues like Bug Hunt, Assault on Terok Nor, even Brotherhood of the Sword, Undine Infiltration and even NTTE.

So? Don't use it there. Having different specializations have varying utility in different content is not necessarily a bad thing. Use it in content where it's useful. Don't use it in content where it isn't useful. It's pretty clear that you might not find it useful anywhere in ground combat. And I can live with that.

>It is introducing an unnecessary element of confusion for your teammates, it can teleport enemies way form mines and AOE attacks and introduces a potential issue of enemies teleporting out of bounds of the map or behind a wall, or an inaccessible section.
That proc chance is just extremely poorly thought out. Most likely by a person that didn't do ground Elites much.

Again, you seem to have missed my use of the words single-player content. Not every single thing added to the game needs to be useful to you personally. The fact that it might be useful to someone somewhere should be enough. 

If someone ruins your ground STF by using this ability, feel free to inform them of their error. Try being less condescending, though. They're more likely to listen to you that way. Good luck!

"Erm, sorry, did you read even half of my comment, let alone watch/read the various links I put into it? You come off as completely ignorant and condescending. Where to start...

>Yeah, sorry, New Vegas fits the bill completely. Same as 3 and 4, it's more of an expansion to 3 than a new game.

Disagreed. While FNV on the surface just looks like ""more of the same of Fo3"" (which is how I initially treated FNV when I first played it), it's a completely different beast, from the way quests are structured, as well as how the main quest fits into the open world (significantly better than Fo3 and 4's quests combined, since they feel like linear campaigns shoved into an open world game, and lead to cognitive dissonance issues, most notably the ""who's my son again? I'm too busy building settlements"" type of thing), the tone, the writing, the pacing... The graphics and animations are mostly the same, but underneath it's not. Fo4 may have improvements with gunplay and all that jazz, but underneath, it's a lot closer to Fo3/Skyrim in the way everything is laid out.

>New Vegas does not have a final boss. Not sure what you're talking about. The different factions you pick largely want you to exterminate the others. 

Do you not consider Legate Lanius a final boss? Because if he isn't considered a boss (you know, the massive guy with huge, badass armor and a massive greatsword, who you fight at the end of the game...), then I don't know who is. I even linked a video in my earlier comment that shows someone talking him down with 100 speech, and serves as one of the few ""dialogue boss battles"" where you have to pass multiple speech checks in order to get him to stand down. You fight this against this guy when going either NCR, Yes Man, or House, the only time you don't fight him is when you're siding with the Legion (obviously). You exterminate a whole lot of the apposing faction's troops, and then you face Lanius himself. 

>Almost all of New Vegas is spent in combat, dialogue is minimal compared to combat.

In my time playing New Vegas (350 hours and counting, halfway through my second playthrough), I remember going from place to place and talking to people, where the vast majority of quests involved dialogue, than it did combat. Granted, there is more combat than dialogue in FNV (And I would not be surprised at all if the same wasn't true of the originals!) They were far more spaced out rather than constant like in Fo4 (where you'd round a corner, come across a group of super mutants, kill them, then round another corner to murder a bunch of raiders who had been living right next door for no reasonable explaination).

>Fallout: New Vegas is not on any level, in any way shape or form, even remotely a game in the same vein as FO1 or 2.

In my opinion, based on me having played all 3 games, it absolutely is. Aside from the obvious fact that it is pretty much a sequel to Fo2 (meaning that it is the ""real"" Fo3 in everything but name), which means it shares not only similar factions, but even characters, but in terms of the way that quests are designed and the way the game is designed in general is much closer to Fo1 and 2 than it is NV. I don't know how else to say this. Gameplaywise when it comes to things like shooting, yes, it's like Fo3/4. But when it comes to questing, and the pace of those quests, what options you have in those quests, the places, the dialogue, etc etc etc... it's closer to Fo1 and 2 in my opinion, based off of my experience.

>Weird that you'd bring up the Powder Gangers, I'd say that's a failure of the game because it's something you see at the beginning of the game and then never again. Just completely abandoned.

???
They come up mostly at the start of the game, yes, with them attacking Goodsprings and taking over Primm (they were also behind the reason why Deathclaws moved into Quarry junction). But aside from their home base in the NCRCF, there's also a group you can find later on in the game in vault 19 that has a major quest basically deciding the faction's fate. They have far more depth and meaning behind them then any of the random super mutants and raiders you slaughter endlessly in Fo3 and 4. They're just there for you to shoot, and that's it.


>Fallout 4 is a radical improvement over New Vegas, anyway. New Vegas has poor gameplay balance, a boring world to explore, boring loot, a janky hardcore mode that doesn't even remotely make the game more challenging or immersive, etc.

I completely disagree on all of those points. The gameplay balance is far better than Fo4's where you are given the most powerful weapons and armor far too early on in the game, and you can craft pretty powerful upgrades, to the point where you might as well not use any other weapons. The balance of the weapons was about as poorly paced as the game's story, throwing you constant promotions all the fucking time (You saved us! You are now our General, without your input! Good job doing all of those radient quests for us, you are now promoted to Paladin, here's a new suit of power armor that only Paladins wear, even though you're already wearing power armor! etc etc etc...).

Also, I'll always completely disagree when someone says ""FNV's world is boring"". I found it far more fascinating than Fo3 and 4's worlds, and here's a good video explaining why, the video does a good job explaining the major issues I was trying to get at, where Fo3/4 focus more on just having things ""look cool"" rather than make sense. I'll try and elaborate more later...

Now, loot... that usually refers to finding cool weapons (since that is the only loot worth finding) Once again, completely disagreed. FNV has far more unique and awesome weapons and just general loot you can find than Fo3 or 4 combined. From the Mysterious Magnum, to That Gun to Two-Step Goodbye, there are far more cooler weapons to be found in the game. You can even get an orbital strike weapon for fuck sakes. Not to mention, every variation of Riot gear is better than whatever armor you can find in Fo3/4 imo. 

>a janky hardcore mode that doesn't even remotely make the game more challenging or immersive, etc.

I do have to give Bethesda credit for improving survival mode (saving only when sleeping is a completely stupid idea though in my opinion), but to say that it didn't even remotely effect the game whatsoever in FNV is completely and utterly false, and you're talking out of your ass at this point.

Now, the big one...

>I think what's clear here is that you aren't really a gamer, you're not in it for gaming mechanics. We'll never see eye to eye. I play games because I love games. You, however, would be better off reading choose your own adventure books. ry Telltale games. They are minimal on gaming, heavy on dialogue choices, right up your alley. You should avoid RPGs and focus on adventure games.

Holy shit, so condescending and ignorant. So, just because I see Fallout as a different light to you, doessn't make me someone who plays games? Mate, my primary hobby involves playing games. Aside from playing Fallout, I've played everything from System Shock 2, to Deus Ex, to Half-Life, to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, to Doom, to Total Annihilation, to Overwatch, to Planetside 2 to Dark Souls... 

I've played hundreds of different types of games for most of my life, and I currently own over 250+ games on Steam, and you dare suggest that I don't play games? We're even in a subreddit called /r/truegaming, if I wasn't ""really a gamer"", then why would I be in this subreddit discussing at length one of my favourite games? You should never ""assume"" anyone of anything and try and look down on them as if to say ""yeah, you don't know what you're talking about"", when clearly, based off how much fucking time I've wasted typing all of this, I do know what I'm talking about.

I LOVE RPGs. it's my favourite genre. As I said, I've played RPGs from Fallout, to SS2, to DX, to VTMB, to ME to DS and to the Witcher. All of these games are amoung my favourite games ever. Fallout is a particular type of RPG (and ""RPG"" is quite the broad term these days), where it's almost like a ""life simulator"" (particularly on hardcore), where you're free to walk around where ever you want, and ask questions about the world. Fo1, 2 and NV answered those questions I had. Fo3 and 4 just ignored me and asked me to shoot raiders for the 15th time instead. Again, watch the video I linked above to get what I mean. Just because you don't care about quests, writing and all that in Fallout, doesn't make me ""not really a gamer"", it means I expect more from this particular franchise aside from just shooting. When it comes to most SP RPGs, I tend to favour the story and writing over combat, but almost every other genre for me, it's the opposite (obviously, particularl when it comes to games like Overwatch)

And yes, I have played Telltale's games, actually. TWD season 1, TotBL and TWAU are all excellent, and I enjoyed them a lot. I also loved Life is Strange by Dontnod.

You're getting extremely defensive without knowing a thing about what we're talking about. Connection speed is not the end-all be-all when it comes to lagging.

Your NAT settings could be wonky. Hell, your neighbors could be stealing your internet and pirating movies. Based on the way you asserted that you have ""One of the best connections in the United States"", I'm going to go ahead and say that there is no way you've inspected, or even KNEW to inspect everything that could be causing you to lag, and there is NO way that you have access to the sort of information that you would need to be able to access to accurately and confidently state that you have ""one of the best connections in the United States"". That's ridiculous and you know it.

> I'm sorry if I come off strong in my argument but you just made assumptions about commonly known experiences based off the fact that I report people for lagging. People don't get banned unjustly.

Furthermore, the system that you use to report people for cheating is a console/wireless service-based tool, such as the Xbox Live reporting tool. Fromsoft does not have access to this information and the service's chief purpose is to help strip the gaming community of cheaters. If you're having problems with connections, the proper place to leave this feedback is on official forums. Reporting everyone that you perceive as lagging because you're upset about your online experience isn't ever going to solve anything."

> Charlie the Unicorn, Salad Fingers, Happy Tree Friends, Rebecca Black, The Annoying Orange - all started as simple YouTube videos, and now all of them have millions of views.

And that has translated to...what? How many of them have albums or short films or novels? What good are 10 million views if you have no product to sell? Internet sensations are exactly that, short lived sensations that fail to grow beyond youtube. To truly grow a viable fan base that will buy your records/merchandise and come to your shows you have to do more than make one viral video. You have to produce a consistent body of work and you have to work to promote yourself or have somebody do it for you.

I'm not saying that bloated record companies are the future, they aren't. The vast majority of the music I listen to is small bands on independent labels or bands that started on independent labels. I'm well aware that they can do things cheaper and more efficiently than many of the big studios. The fact remains though that even independent labels spend a lot of money on promotion. Artists will always be attracted to the biggest label because that is the best way to become an overnight sensation.

If you're going to cite an example of viral videos in relation to music then the best example is the catalog of Ok Go. The top two results on that link have 55 million views between them. But you have to understand that this is a real band with real records and real fans. You would be shocked by the price tag associated with the production of these videos.

Really? Because the context of the actual comic is far worse than what I was implying, it was only the outside context where they were explicitly discussing behaviours where its implications aren't outright racist (though, in a hilarious way, because fuck SeaLions, lazy little assholes think they're so cute, but they're just sacks of fat and spite). No, if you look at the context with what she mentions, the bad behaviors could literally be anything, and the joke is just kinda cute, and not meant to be turned into a phrase to describe people arguing with you in bad faith. Maybe I'm interpreting it wrong, but are you seriously going to arguing that my interpretation is in bad faith, or isn't invalid?

>It’s possible to imagine a world where the sea lion is asking in good faith, but the entire joke is premised off of the understanding that everybody understands exactly what is being said,

I'm sorry, what exactly is being said? Is she actually talking about Nazi's? Because then the joke wouldn't be as funny if a literal Nazi was following her around. No, I'm really not getting where this idea that the Sea Lion is insincere actually comes from. I get that this was made around the time of #notAllMen, which may mean it was riffing on this idea of men hounding feminists and making bullshit questions, but this doesn't really work, because feminists were very rarely actually saying thigns that #notAllMen could reasonably be responded to. Saying things like ""Most women you know have been sexually assaulted"" and being answred like ""Not all men are rapists!"" is a non-arguement, and simply derails the conversation. But if somebody said ""All men are rapists"" or ""all sex in our current society is rape"", then people might actually be able to answer ""Not all men are rapists"" and it wouldn't be derailing. 

>but the sea lion is pretending to naively misunderstand, which is funny because it is a classic “sealioning” tactic in the first place.

How the hell is it pretending to naively misunderstand? It is saying it wants to talk about a statement that she made, not diliberately misunderstanding her. I mean, the Sea Lion is probably all like ""You racist piece of shit"", but no, I'm sorry you're extrapolating something that isn't being shown in the comic at all.

>It’s not surprising to me that you get accused of the same as it’s hard to fathom your interpretation of the comic is genuine (“wow, she racist”) rather than a sarcastic embodiment of sealioning itself.

I mean, the wow shes racist thing is just a joke I was peppering in, because its one of the actual premises of the comment itself (But seriously fuck sea lions). And remember, the term sealioning literally comes from this comic, so how could this comic even be a metacommentary on sealioning.

Everything you say, I can't take serious because from the start you haven't been serious. Respect is earned and you have been an asshole ever since we started this conversation. 

Now before you make another insinuation. There have been people who've called me out it in a respectful way and haven't used any of the foul language you use. And I accept that. Other people than you have proven the point that I'm being a hypocrite because on that 8 winning streak, I had good teammates and was playing against bad opponents and thus i shouldn't really complain. 

And now you might think: ""but i said that too""
Sure, but in the most disrespectful way you could possibly write something. And if you're going to be an ass, then you shouldn't expect people to take you seriously. You want to be heard and not have your main points ignored? Stop with calling me retarded, idiotic and crazy. Stop with the condescending tone. 

>Apparently, you never heard of figurative use of language
This for instance proofs my point. You just can't help yourself. 
You just have to feel superior. 

>you just try to make me feel bad about my choice of words. Out of every point I made in the last post you pick out ''tinfoil hat'' and ignore everything else.

Absolutely, you think i'm going to sit here and be consistently insulted for no reason and then be called insane? You honestly think that you shouldn't feel bad about saying these things? Tell your mom, your dad, your siblings, your guardian, whatever all those insults and see how they'll respond. Call them crazy, call them retarded, call them baby's when they complain. See how well that turns out. 

Just because you don't know me, doesn't mean you can be disrespectful. 

>You still go on about how I'm not ''useful'' when I not only never claimed I was

You've been a hypocrite this entire post. You can call me whatever you want but the second I turn the heat onto you, i'm this weasel (another insult) who's demonizing you. You can't take responsibility for what you've said.

>If only you used half of the effort to provide actual points... 

There'se no points to be given about the thread I made. There'se no actual debate. This has been about me defending myself from your consistent insults and condescending jabs at me. We even have new words to add to your insult list towards me: weasel & manipulative.

Maybe you don't get this because i'm guessing youre probably a teenager. But it's not okay to treat people the way you treated me. Use any of the words you used to describe me and tell them to the people you care about. You don't think about the severity of the words you use. You just use them to hurt me.

"> First off the porn community is people who watch porn.

It's not a ""community"". A community is a small or local unit of people who share something. The majority of people in the west consume porn, so it's a mass-consumed field of media.

So? What does that have to do with mentioning someone else having been a porn actress? There's talking about porn and there's talking about porn.

> So yeah, going to strangers and saying someone you know was in a porno is pretty insensitive and seems like intent to hurt.

Strangers? Where are you getting that from? These are people in a group, where one person shared a fact about another person in that circle. Human beings are built to share social facts within their social circles. It's a fundamental, tribal instinct.

Stop attributing harm to his actions without knowing his actual reasoning. Talking about something that someone MIGHT be ashamed of isn't malicious by default. It all comes down to context.

> 3) treating women like the grown human they are doesn’t mean you have to put their dirty laundry on display. Being a grown human means having compassion and maybe letting information that could hurt someone’s feelings slide by the wayside.

I never said that you HAVE TO put her dirty laundry on display, but calling someone who merely commented on the public actions of another person a dickhead, asshole and douche without knowing the details of how and why he said anything reeks of condescending, male white knighting that both blames one person who might be innocent of malice and reduces another person to the status of childlike victim with no agency of their own.

>The obvious one, the one you cling to and quote and worship, is the statement ""we know everything there is to know about atoms."" You then go from that statement to say that ""we know everything there is to know about [brains].""

I'm not saying ""we know everything there is to know about brains."" We don't (for now) have the ability to fully simulate whole humans brains. Nor am I saying that computational irreducibility doesn't exist, just that it's a moving target defined by our technology and not some absolute feature of the universe. Proteins were computationally irreducible, until they weren't. The brains of nematode worms were computationally irreducible, until they weren't. I expect human brains will continue to be computationally irreducible, until they aren't, maybey sometime after 2080. Now, while we don't know everything about how the brain works, that doesn't mean we don't know anything. We do know:

 quite a bit about how neurons work at the:
 molecular level
 cellular level
 systems level
 cognitive level
 that brains are made of atoms whose behavior is constrained by QFT.
 consciousness is strongly correlated with detectable, physical changes in the brain.
 that physical damage to the brain can effect consciousness.
 that consciousness can also be altered by chemicals or electrical stimulation (both of which are physical).

-

Given these considerations, I don't think it's unreasonable to say that ""the brain gives rise to consciousness"" (or rather ""mind is what the brain does"") is the null hypothesis here. We don't need to know everything about how the brain works to conclude that it's responsible for consciousness any more than I need to perfectly understand how my car works to know it's responsible for moving me around town, rather than some non-material ""caria."" In the chain of events from your brain receiving some sensory input, to it directing your muscles to contract, there is no single step that is not adequately explained by the interaction of atoms where we must say, ""Ah yes, and here is the bit we can't explain that must be magic,"" even if the entire process itself is (for now) too complex to model computationally. Our understanding of those underlying laws of physics is so incredibly solid and well-established that there should be an enormous presumption against modifying them in some important way just to account for consciousness.

Imagine what it would entail to truly believe that consciousness is not accounted for by physics. It would entail, among other things, that the behavior of ordinary matter would occasionally deviate from that expected on the basis of physics alone, even in circumstances where consciousness was not involved in any obvious way. Several billion years ago there weren’t conscious creatures here on Earth. It was just atoms and particles, bumping into each other in accordance with the rules of physics and chemistry. Except, if mind is not physical, at some point they swerved away from those laws, since remaining in accordance with them would never have created consciousness. In effect, the particles understood that sticking to their physically prescribed behaviors would never accomplish the universe’s grand plan of producing conscious life. So, at what point does this deviation from purely physical behavior kick in, exactly? If you want to claim that what happens in our brain isn’t simply following the laws of physics, you have the duty to explain in exactly what way the electrons in our atoms fail to obey their equations of motion.[X]

There is no evidence for consciousness separate from the brain. There is no evidence as to what consciousness would then be, and how it interacts with the brain. [Dualism]( http  and idealism are just inventing a massive mystery to explain what they perceive as another mystery, and they don’t really accomplish anything. In this way non-materialist notions of consciousness are very much “god of the gaps” arguments. You're simply searching for gaps in scientific knowledge (We can't perfectly model everything!) and insisting that nonphysical consciousness (and telekinesis? You've been a little cagey on what exactly your opinions on that matter are) is hiding inside those gaps. 


You are starting with your sense, your gut feeling, that consciousness is something different than physical matter, that subjective experience is not material, and then proceeding from that premise to invent a mysterious magical consciousness that does not need to obey the laws of physics to explain consciousness. You are confusing unexplained with unexplainable [X].

How life works used to be a gap in our scientific knowledge as well. Some people filled that gap with vitalism, the belief that living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things. Vitalism gradually fell out of favor, as the explanatory power of biochemistry continued to grow, and I belive we are now in the midst of the same thing happening with consciousness: as our understanding of neuroscience continues to grow, the gaps that you are trying to fill with non-material conciseness will continue to shrink until there is nothing left. Keep in mind that, ""throughout history, every mystery, ever solved, as turned out to be... NOT MAGIC."" Or, said another way, ""Never has an empirical scientific discovery been deemed wrong and replaced by a more convincing mystical explanation."" But hey, maybe this time will be different.

If you still aren't convinced, rather than seeing you just insist that consciousness cannot be purely physical, I would be more interested to hear exactly how your explanation for consciousness works, and how your explanation addresses the mind-body problem.

> Apps with parts closed parts can be reviewed by trusted companys to give them a ""secure"" sign. Its almost the same effect.

No. Not even close. In a world where you cannot even trust your own government, why would you be able to trust those companies? Why would a company refuse to give a ""secure"" rating for a company that has paid them money to do the review in the first place? And how would you know that the software they push to the servers is the same that was reviewed? Without being able to compile it from source, there is simply no possibility to know they are not fucking you over.

Which is fine as long as you believe those companies are not evil. But if they are not, why would you have anything against sending them plaintext messages? It is just false advertising to act as if you didn't have to trust them to not look at your data because ""everything is encrypted!"" but in fact you are running their code on your device and you have no idea about what it does.

"> resistances as a balancing mechanic are shaky, at best

It's not that hard to grasp, is it? This isn't a videogame, where encounters are predetermined and always similar. This is a game where the DM picks what monsters to put you up against. This leads to one of the following scenarios when it comes to resistances:

1. The DM does not let resistances weigh heavily into his monster choice (preferring other, more relevant factors), and opts for a wide variety of monsters. In this scenario, the wizard will only ever be hindered by resistances every so often, in which case a normal wizard can just resort to many other given spells.
2. The DM picks monsters with a specific theme in mind (like undead, or fire/volcano monsters, or arctic monsters), that heavily feature resistances. In this case, either some spells will just be completely useless (fireball in a fire-heavy adventure, for instance). This is not balance, and if you think it is, please give arguments on how this constitutes balance.
3. The DM specifically picks resistances to ""balance"" out the resident wizard. This is a problematic scenario, in which the DM targets a specific player/character. This definitely does not make balance.

I've played this game enough that resistances (on monsters) are much more of a thematic/flavor thing than something to actually balance by. Ability modifiers are far more relevant, and accordingly, that feature is rest-gated. But, please, explain how resistances factor into healthy balance. And if at all possible, try actually explaining, instead of stating something like it's gospel, whilst spending more effort insulting me than actually defending your own point of view. Christ.

A spell that would kill everything around you with no save, does so unconditionally. This would be broken beyond any reasonable DM's discretion. A fireball with a mile range, on the other, does the exact same thing a fireball (a spell that by no means is broken), except from a mile away.

This is where the ""DM fiat"" comes into play. Yes, being able to cast this from a mile away can break a game. On the other hand, how many scenarios will this realistically happen for any reasonable party and DM? It's still subject to normal fireball rules, other than range. Any wall, or corner, fucks it. Any excessive cover is going to impede effectivenesss. Like, I dunno, a forest, or a city, or really any reasonable adventuring region that aren't LotR style open plains. And if you're fighting hordes of enemies on an open plain, from miles away, whilst playing a savant, and your DM didn't see this coming, he's the problem, not the feature. This feature only breaks the game as much as the DM will allow it, without requiring the DM to go to unreasonable lengths to keep it balanced (unlike your strawman kill-all spell). It's entirely possible that if you take a random adventure, this feature might never come up. 

>If you can't understand how a 1 mile range on spells breaks the game you lack imagination.

If you can't understand how a 1 mile range on spells can be easily kept in check by a decent DM, you lack imagination. It's situationally powerful, and in most scenarios where it's powerful, it's more of a showcase on how magic is problematic to begin with.

>I'm going to type this out, just so it sinks in. ""As a bonus action, you can call to mind the ability to cast one spell of your choice from any class's spell list."" Maybe try reading

Oh really? Let me clarify the quote I was replying to.

>always have at least one cast of any given, highly specific spell 

>from your expansive spellbook

Emphasis mine, quote yours. I was responding to your quote, and as far as I knew, you were referring to the level 10 ""Prodiguous Memory"" feature, and not level 14 ""Master of Magic"" feature. 

The level 14 feature is pretty good. But while ""Magical Secrets"" exist, the only thing this feature has over that, is the ability to break specific puzzles or encounters with super niche spells. It's worth noting that Wish can copy any spell below 8th level as well, and waives any requirements (including class) or costly components. Yes, Wish is castable only from level 17 onwards, 3 levels later, but Master of Magic spell still follow other requirements (like spell slots) and components.

>Maybe try reading

Maybe try reading your own damn post. It's right up there, you condescending prick. If you're gonna be a douche, go ahead. But at least don't lecture me on mistakes that you made yourself.

>Factually incorrect, and you don't understand what versatility does in this game, somehow, despite you knowing how wizard versatility is a problem in a previous paragraph.

Oh no, the wizard gets to be a bit more versatile once per rest. Boo hoo. But Wish still exists.

I'm sorry you don't understand how to actually have a sensible discussion without coming off as a complete asshole. You would've come off a lot more convincing if you didn't chew me out on your own mistake. It did make chuckle though, so there was that.

>but this will be my last attempt to explain to you.

So, really, you ran out of actual arguments, and resorted to petty insults. Wonderful. At least I took the time to type out my arguments and try to back them up, all you've been doing is telling me I'm wrong, and telling me I don't understand the game, without any real substantiation, evidence, or even anecdotes."
">There are millions of vegans in the US alone. And protein deficiency is not common among them. That is obviously enough of a sample size.

Sure. Less than 1% if the population of ONE country that's atypically rich compared to the world average. That's definitely an accurate statistical sampling.

>Huh? How is that related to what I said, which was that cooking does not necessarily need to take a lot of time.

Well if cooking is so obviously quick, cheap, and easy, the only reason people don't do it is because they don't know how (stupid) or they don't want to (lazy). Since we're discussing the poor specifically (in that they can't afford to eat vegan), I assume that your conclusion is they are stupid and lazy for not having healthy, cheap, home cooked meals. After all, there couldn't possibly be any other explanation for why they wouldn't.

>No goalposts were moved. You claimed that vegan meals at restaurants are more expensive than non-vegan meals, and that is not true. When you actually compare apples to apples (i.e. vegan and non-vegan meals at the same restaurant), vegan meals are cheaper or the same price.

Let's check the tape:

>>The issue isn't that eating out is more expensive than preparing food at home. It's that eating out as a vegan is significantly more expensive than not.

Huh. It appears I made no such claim. I simply stated a fact that you've conveniently sidestepped (because you can't actually disprove it) that if you are buying your food out instead of making it at home, it's more expensive to do so when you add the stipulation that it also be vegan.

Unless you mean this part:

>>Alright then. Go ahead and point me to the fast food restaurant where you can order a $5 vegan meal that includes drink. 
>>If you meant,
>>
>>>You can go to any ""sit down"" restaurant and get a vegan option cheaper than your friends who are ordering non vegan food,
>>
>>then, yes. That's certainly true, [...and] still require around an hour of free time to do. Which brings us neatly back around to the whole ""poor people aren't typically overburdened with free time"" thing.

Where I acknowledge that as long as you start at a certain price and time spent threshold yes, vegan meals are cheaper than non vegan meals. But saying, ""Vegan meals are always cheaper! As long as you don't count places that are too cheap to have vegan meals available,"" isn't really an ""apples to apples"" comparison, is it?

>Wait, weren't you concerned about nutrition just a few comments ago? Now you're saying that you have to eat at cheap fast food places? What was that about moving goalposts? 

That you were the one doing it. In TWO places now. My arguments are that nutritionally balanced (this part of the argument is really to point out that it is more complex than simply buying a pallet of bananas and eating that for a month) vegan food prepared at home is more time consuming than the more improverished members of our society can afford and SEPARATELY that eating vegan food out is more expensive than simply eating out.

Also, nutritionally unbalanced enough that it will shorten your lifespan (eating fast food for every meal) and nutritionally unbalanced enough that you will be lucky to finish out the year (the hypothetical pallet of bananas) are two wildly different things.

>I don't go to any of those except Subway, so I can't comment on them. At Subway in my country (Canada), the vegan option (veggie delite) is at the cheapest price level. If you add avocado or a veggie patty, it's still cheaper than some of the premium meat ones.

If you eat at Subway you may not be as vegan as you think you are. I would have thought that with your condescending ""Do you even know anything about veganism?"" I wouldn't have to explain to you that vegetarian =/= vegan.

>There is no $1 burger in Canada.

Well then it must not exist anywhere.

>Even if there was, you can't possibly be saying that it's ok to at $1 burgers every day long-term.

Over a sufficiently long term, certainly not. Over a long enough term that people don't notice the damage it's doing, definitely.

>You think people can go to McDonald's, order, and leave in 5 minutes - 100% of the time?

Yes. Or near enough to 100% of the time that the variation is immaterial to the discussion at hand.

>Have you ever been to a McDonald's? You might be waiting that long just to get your food at some times, let alone actually going there.

Then you've got a particularly shitty McDonald's. Which I'm sure you must go to frequently. You know, as a vegan.

>LOL...now you're saying eating five $1 McDonald's burgers a day and nothing else is appetizing? Are you insane?

And you, as a vegan considering the prospect of eating five hamburgers are certainly an impartial judge of what is and is not appetizing to the general public.

>Do you actually think that someone could or should do this?

Could? Yes. I've done it on occasion when I was younger and I had a particularly rough month, financially.

>I personally spend less than $250 (Canadian) per month for groceries for two people. We do most of our cooking on the weekend, usually cooking two similar meals at the same time at lunchtime and dinnertime, and then heat up leftovers during the week for lunch at work and dinner after work.

Cool story bro. Not what I asked.

>So it doesn't take that long at all. About 3 hours during the weekend, and maybe an hour or two per week shopping.

Ah, so, assuming someone has sufficient money (and storage space for the food) to buy and prepare in bulk, they can hit right around the mark of the same price and only spend THREE HOURS LONGER doing it.

>Or...you could just eat five $1 McDonald's burgers a day (which don't actually exist in Canada).
>
>LOL....

And again clearly because you've never seen them (and I'm sure, as a vegan, you must spend just gobs of time value shopping for fast food hamburgers) it can't exist. (That's a different link than the first one, this time listing FIVE different burgers from five different restaurants, none of which are the burger or restaurant I linked previously.)

I know it really harshes you and your SO's ""We're just better than other people because of our dietary decisions"" thing you have going to acknowledge that it's not actually something everyone could choose to do but just isn't, but the truth is that (aside from being not as environmentally friendly as vegans like to tell themselves) it's simply not an affordable diet for the impoverished in first world countries and could be a death sentence in less developed nations."
">In other words, you think your belief that first cousin marriage is biologically acceptable is so right that everyone who disagrees with you must know this. It's not even up for debate, you think, it is settled.

I advised a public health campaign. Naturally it would be good to minimise first cousin marriages on the grounds of it being a very tiny increase in birth defects, but it's not a pressing matter - and certainly not worth banning!

>in order to argue that UKIP are being RACIST

One UKIP member outrightly said that the entire point of the bill was to end first cousin marriages on grounds of them being 'unBritish'.

>Isn't it ""projecting"" to think that an opinion you hold strongly must also be held by other people deep down?

You're implying that scientific evidence is 'opinion'. Which it isn't - or at least, it certainly isn't when something has consensus, as it does here.

>I'm afraid this reasoning is also flawed.

You never actually explained why the 'reasoning' that first cousin marriage gives birth defects of a similar rate to late pregnancy is 'flawed'.

>This is a whataboutism at best

>It doesn't make first cousin birth and its defect rate any better, Cock.

This is a top meme. You really need to learn what and where a whataboutism actually applies. In this case, i'm using an everyday example to show that a 2% increase is minor, even negligable. If you say that water has been found in 100% of tumours, and I say that water has been found in 100% of humans full stop, that's not a whataboutism, that's me pointing out that the water is not relevant. Similarly, again, a 2% increase is negligable.

The only projection going on here is from yourself, who wants to project the idea that I want to deem UKIP racist, or otherwise racially insensitive. The scientific evidence available to us tells us that there is no real biological basis to ban first cousin marriages, since a 2% birth defect rate increase is meaningless. When I brought this up to UKIPpers, they didn't take this onboard - in fact, as i've already said, they expressed disgust at the very idea of first cousin marriages (which is ethnocentrist at best), and, again, said it should be banned as an 'Un-British activity'. In what universe is this incredible condescending and ignorant statement not racist - one where you actively ignore the available evidence, in order to ban certain liberties generally only taken advantage of by a specific subset of the population, because you disagree with it?

">Yes, it can, but that's tangential to the topic at hand.

I'd say that it's central to the topic at hand. If anything and everything can be classified as a religious tenet, then you're left with three choices:

1. Pick and choose which tenets are acceptable in these types of circumstances based on some sort of popularity metric (Wearing a burqa is okay because it's a ""real"" religion, but hockeymaskism isn't, so screw that guy).

2. Permit all religious trappings to be expressed (Including the guy wearing a hockey mask, or someone whose religion requires them to scream at the top of their lungs every 15 seconds).

3. Ignore religions altogether, and draft secular rules -- that address practical concerns -- which everyone must follow.

I'm not arguing the definition. I agree that this is the definition of cheating. I disagree that everyone would call that wrong. There is a difference between cheating in a multiplayer environment (such as Elite pvp) and a single-player envrionment (almost everything else in Elite). PvE in this game is fundamentally single-player with benefits. What someone does at a neutron star is between them and the neutron star as far as I'm concerned.

Not sure how that is relevant to anything. I'm pretty sure EVERYTHING in the game is only seen by the main characters and the player. By that logic, the ""map"" could be leading anywhere.

I disagree. Neither of these points are actual evidence. If you believe the Egg is the Epsilon missions, the UFO is the Omega scrap missions, and the ""jetpack man"" is a scuba diver searching for nuclear waste, those would all be tangible as well. You could argue that a submarine, a cool dune buggy and $2 Million are better rewards than the UFO's. Something being tangible isn't proof it's connected to the mural.

>No, it lends credibility to the possibility that the mural was once supposed to refer to a bigger deal than the UFOs, and they left it in the game to refer to just the UFOs. Which leaves us with ""the mural is just about the UFOs"".

I don't agree that it lends credibility to that possibility. That alien mission just seemed tacked on as a nod to the Chiliad Mystery hunting community. I think the fact that you have to complete 600 bunker sales missions only lends credibility to the argument that the mural was just a massive troll job and it doesn't really mean anything more than ""there is a UFO on top of Chiliad.""

>They are hints to the locations of the other UFOs. The UFO is seen on top of the car at the hippie camp, the egg is seen at Paleto Bay, and the jetpack is supposed to lead GTA:SA players to this game's version of Area 69. At each one of those, there is a secondary UFO close by.

Again... we're just going in circles. This is the part I have a problem with. Saying Ft. Zancudo is GTAV's version of Area 69 is just flat-out wrong. Since most locations kept their names from GTA: San Andreas, I wonder why they changed the name of Area 69? Possibly because Area 69 is supposed to be a parody of Area 51, a ""secret"" government base in the middle of the Nevada desert. Ft. Zancudo, on the other hand, is a re-creation of an above-board naval air base on the outskirts of LA County called Point Mugu. 

>I agree that would be possible, except, as I said, the mural leads to a tangible result. The hamburger sign doesn't (yet).

And in my opinion, the only tangible results from the mural (so far) are the 5 glyphs on the cliff faces and the UFO that appears at 100%, in the rain.

>Because the mural clearly points to a UFO hovering above the mountain, and there is a giant UFO in the game hovering above the mountain, right next to the mural. That's a pretty big Exhibit A.

Again, that's not the part I'm debating. My problem is connecting the symbols at the bottom to the locations of the other UFO's. The UFO on top of the station wagon at the Hippy Camp is not the only model UFO in the game, and there are a bunch of places that resemble the cracked egg.

>I don't think I have ever called anyone an idiot here. I do call certain ideas stupid when they're... extremely stupid. But usually I start out polite.

I disagree. Your comments are almost always condescending or snide. Maybe you don't realize it, but your comments are rarely polite. 

>I also agree it might mean nothing, but I think that's unlikely.

Do you have any other suggestions of what it might mean?

>Say what? LOL, I was here continuously for like 4 years saying the same things and the sub was still an ""echo chamber""

Exactly, you just regurgitate the same comment over and over again. I've seen you post it about a dozen times. The sub isn't an echo-chamber, because most people have wildly different opinions.

>Uranus/observatory is a female alien vagina

This was one post by one guy about a year ago and you act as if that's the most popular theory around.

>Nikola Tesla

The Tesla theories were trending about three years ago, but you still bring them up every time. Maybe it interested people because they noticed the handful of Tesla references that actually ARE in the game. Rolling your eyes at all-things-Tesla is just willful ignorance.

>Matrix posts

Since the game world is literally a simulation your character is ""trapped"" in, it's really not a surprise people would compare it to the Matrix. The idea of ""waking up"" is used in many religious teachings, cult manifestos, and self-help programs, which is why you see people falling down these crazy metaphysical rabbit holes when looking into some of the more subtle jokes Rockstar injected into the game.

>with anything else contrary shot down in flames.

This is obviously not true. EVERYTHING is shot down by SOMEONE. You do it to people who talk about Karma or Tesla, and others do it to theories you think are more legitimate. You're just cherry-picking. There have been hundreds of theories about the many different aspects of the Chiliad Mystery.

>Then suddenly it died. Why? 

But it hasn't died, it has just spread out among all the different social media platforms. People just don't post on Reddit anymore because the comments are usually sarcastic or mean. Maybe English isn't the poster's first language, or they aren't very educated, but we shouldn't dismiss their thoughts for those reasons alone. Many of us could be better about this.

>What changed is that a big honking clue surfaced that there's nothing more to the mural so a lot of people gave it up and the traffic died down.

Now I know Reddit doesn't make sub traffic stats public anymore, but this sub's traffic has been as lively as ever. The only difference is people are now too hesitant to post or comment. That memo that you're referring to has been floating around for years (it was written in 2012), and there is no evidence it has anything to do with the mural or the Chiliad Mystery."

Ah and here it is, the old, ""I managed to pull myself up on my own bootstraps with no help from anyone, no sir, all by my lonesome. And if others can't do it, well that's their fault and they can go fuck themselves for being 'whiny excuse machines'."""
">huh? toning is not a real thing. 

Yes it IS a real thing just not in the sense most people use it for. Its a misnomer, yes, but its still a thing. And burning fat while increasing muscle is most certainly NOT impossible to do at the same time. It may not be as efficient as focusing on one or the other however. 

From the FAQ ""Just remember the simple formula: increased muscle size + lower body fat = ""toned"" body."" 

So the op MAY be gaining muscle while losing fat but her muscle is inhibiting her ability to cross her legs. If she stretched and became more limber it may help in this area. Just as the OP of your response said.

As far as being an ass goes you could have atleast pointed out WHAT you thought was wrong, or what his error was for him to look up, instead you just posted a comment that is normally for people who are asking noob questions and need direction. It came across condescending.

My first career was as a make-up FX/prop artist for TV and Film, and I have probably worked on many of the movies and TV you've seen. So, for someone like me, these ""odd"" details are very important.

>I never said I was against going to a metalworking shop to have it welded.

It's not clear from your original post that the aim here is to make instructions rather than an actual object. I may have given different advice had i known.

>Sure, I could just wing it, and cut out five different pieces of metal and figure out what works, but I kind of figured I would first consult experts in metal work, in the hopes that they would be able to use their experience to save me hours of trial and error, and wasted materials.

I was not trying to discredit the idea of using calculations to get an approximate value for bend deduction. However Since you seem to want to use hand tools, the predictive value of calculations is really limited.

Making a flange that is intentionally too long and filing it down is a completely valid approach that creates no waste. It is in no way ""winging it"".

">As a political slacktivist, I would much rather this issue not come about at all.

Yeah, me too. There are plenty of other issues to be concerned about, like you mentioned. And I do agree that there is a class war going on, that diversionary tactics are used by politicians to win elections, and that people are gullible. But here's where you lost me:

>Do you REALLY think a state can ban abortions? Really? Roe vs Wade has to be overturned first.

Yes, I really, REALLY do think a state can ban abortions, and no, Roe vs. Wade doesn't have to be overturned to do it. What has already happened in a number of states, and what may happen in others, is that women have no access to abortion services. Fetal pain bills, limits on late-term abortions, federal omissions and funding cuts, terrorism and harassment, and geographic reality all conspire to ensure that free choice is out of the hands of most women in the United States. Roe V. Wade remains unaffected, but as a practical reality women don't have access to the services they are legally entitled to. 

>As for the vagina probe laws, that shouldn't be a problem getting rid of with the political clout Feminism has at their disposal. Where's the OWS-type rallies? Why must they sit around and wait for men to start protests before they hijack it for their own causes? But that's a seperate issue.

Again, you've lost me. First you say that ""Feminism"" (?) has a lot of political clout and can solve its own problems, but then suggest that women are sitting around and waiting ""for men to start protests""? So, which is it: does the women's movement have the ability to fight its own battles, or are we (as you so condescendingly put it) reliant on men to do it for us? I think the answer is pretty obvious - women can and do fight for their right to free choice. But since you asked, here's a list of rallies and marches set for April 28th to protest the war on women's reproductive rights. 

I know you see this as some cynical attempt by politicians to create a wedge issue and use it to win votes. But there is a practical effect here, and it goes way beyond an election cycle. Women in this country are fighting for their most basic right: the right to control their own bodies. And it's not just a manufactured crisis they're fighting against, as there has been a steady erosion of family planning care and access for the last three decades, starting almost immediately after Roe V. Wade was passed. For millions of women in this country, this issue is more important than the financial crisis or the war on drugs. If we can't even control our own bodies, how are we supposed to take on all of the other problems facing this country?

And look, honestly, I could give a shit about prescription birth control coverage. I think we should have it, I think it's ridiculous that it's not already covered when drugs like Viagara are, but there are far more serious challenges to women's healthcare than this single issue. But a lot of other women who don't have the funds to spare for basic birth control, much less care for a child, see this as a major issue, and I'm not going to dictate to them what their priorities should be. 

But the next time you start talking about issues like ""Rich vs. Poor"" and class warfare, maybe you should give some thought to the economic issues of family planning, and ask yourself why, if it's so inexpensive, employers are so reluctant to pay for birth control? Because compared to the cost of pregnancy (particularly an unwanted pregnancy), it seems like a pretty damn good deal. 

But of course there are other issues at play here, and they have nothing to do with the cost of a pill. "

Because I'm not calling you these things? Its addressing your argument and those words describe it.

">Their mentality is to supplicate women

Supplication isn't feminist at all, nor are Disney films. I don't know where you get your information! Chivalry and being a ""gentleman"" are highly traditional, rather condescending poses predicated upon the idea of strong differences between men and women. Feminism, at least in its most recent incarnations, works to erase rather than support hard gender binaries. 

-edit: the chivalry stuff can also fuel an attitude of entitlement (""You have to like me, I'm a nice guy!"") that, again, has nothing to do with feminism at all. You should be neither a douche nor a supplicant. You should be a good, lively, self-respecting person, regardless of what sex you are.

First off, maybe don't open with a condescending asshole question? 

Second, nobody knows who any coach is until they become a coach. I couldn't name a single assistant coach that wasn't from the Raptors outside of Tex Winter, basically ever. Same with D/G-League coaches. But all coaches have to start somewhere.

Second, Craig is 35 years old, never played pro and has been involved in coaching in some capacity for 15 years, I'd be stunned if he doesn't get a shot as an NBA coach down the line. 

As for the ""no pressure"" and ""no egos"" argument, that's bullshit. Is it the same as the NBA? No, nothing is, but then using that argument nobody should hire any head coach that hasn't already been an NBA head coach, and I think you can see the problem with that. 

And finally, at no point did I say he will be a head coach next year. He absolutely should be coaching in the NBA though, and I think either an assistant job with a team like the Spurs (but not the Spurs specifically) that is looking to groom a replacement or with a team like Phoenix that could use him for player development and then make him the HC 1-2 years from now. With that said, I think he could be a head coach next season, he's a defensive wizard and his pro experience will help him deal with that pressure and egos."

Three points. A kidney, under normal circumstances, will never be a human being. Also, a kidney does not have organs for reproduction, unlike a fetus. Lastly, a kidney lacks homeostasis. It does not have the organs to self-regulate. A fetus, however, does have these organs.

> > Can you pin down the exact moment someone receives consciousness?

> No. Nor does my point require me to...

There is no biological change in the baby when it is born. Yes, it starts breathing, but this is just it using the tools it already has. A newborn baby is just as conscious as a fetus. What is it about being in a uterus that forfeits all your rights?

You don't have to be ""doing shit"" to be alive. A fetus is doing a lot more than your average person does in five years. It grows from a single cell into a complicated, functioning human. A fetus ten days before birth is doing just as much stuff as a 10 day old baby.

> And neither are vaccines. Or inhalers. Or GMOs. Or a whole slew of other things. Who gives a fuck if the process is natural?

Because you were trying to say that a fetus has no right to life because it can't survive under ""natural circumstances."" I have disproved your point. I would be against inhalers and vaccines if they involved the killing of a live human being.

> How is forcing an unwilling mother to carry and unwanted fetus to term ""the lesser of two evils"" ?

Um... You either kill someone or make someone's life hard. It's pretty clear. And don't try to tell me that having an unwanted baby is worse than death.

> You were talking about me being in a minority. That article was talking about defining life. My request still stands. 

By the scientific definition of life, a fetus is alive. You are disagreeing with the science. You are in a minority. Sure, maybe there are more uninformed pro-abortion people than qualified scientists; you may be right.

> > Killing a baby ten days after it has left the uterus is exactly the same as killing a fetus ten days before it was to be born.

> Did I forget to call your pro-life mantras cute?

So... are you actually going to respond, or just be condescending?

> However, if you want to say birth is blurry - you go right ahead. 

Birth is just a shift in location. Look at the fetus as an isolated system. Take a snapshot of every cell in the fetus right before birth. Take a snapshot of the baby directly after birth. 99.999% of the cells will be exactly the same.

I would like to ask you, why is it OK to abort a fetus. We agree that it is a human. By the scientific definition it is alive. It can survive under normal circumstances. Why does this fetus not have the same rights as a baby?"

No. 

Your reasoning is flawed and lacks both scope and insight - implying that ""if I were a designer, I'd have this mystical power to know that you're right and that it's good design"" is nonsensical. 

People hating on it because they don't like it might be a very good example of the very fact that it's bad design. Or do you think folks here don't like it because it's a Bentley? That makes no sense. I don't particularly like Porsche as a brand but I'll admit they're capable of great (if vaguely unchanging) designs.

For an advanced topic: try assuming your lack of understanding is a problem on your end, or a problem with the media rather than a problem at the speaker's end. For instance, perhaps this whole disagreement is due to my unwillingness to spend the time to explain my conclusion in more detail. I considered that, but threw it out because I very clearly and succinctly stated my position was based on warrants and you continued along the line of the courts used to obtain the warrants making the issues unrelated... as if the secrecy behind the FISA courts somehow makes the entire act of obtaining a warrant at the local or federal levels completely alien.

And the 'right' and 'right for you' distinction is exactly why I phrased it that way. I kind of find your comment really condescending.

Edit2: I hesitated in saying this initially because I was worried about being frowned upon myself, but you know what - for me, sex is intertwined with my spirituality. I only enjoy sleeping with people I love and who I feel love and value me. There would be circumstances where I'd feel uncomfortable continuing a relationship with someone based on their past sexual decisions and I don't necessarily feel that learning to overcome those feelings would be for my personal betterment. 

Having said that I've made my fair share of ""mistakes"" regarding who I've slept with and I do feel bad about it. I wish I had less sexual partners, not because women should be chaste, not because people shouldn't enjoy sex.

It's hard not to throw insults at condescending people like you when you act so righteous only zoning in on what suits you and completely glossing over others, I'll just repeat what I have to say every time on this sub to you who are completely oblivious at best,

gameplay mechaincs != artistic thematic direction....

Battlefield has always strived for authenticity, there's a reason they go out of their way to get vehicle/weapon/character models realistic and not wearing jeans and a tee in the past. They've had hovering tanks in BF4, Jet packs in BF1942 yet there was no outrage, because that was a gameplay a choice yet. Camo is the only real argument but even at that at least it's not because they're shoving an agenda down our throat like that video on the frontpage said"
"Well I'm glad you are a theist and a Catholic. 

1. Is the fossil record accurate. Yes. The fossil record accurately portraying the historical past isn't in any way hindered by supernatural alteration of the past from one time line to another. Both ideas can be simultaneously valid. 

2. I've looked it up and it no longer is universal Catholic belief to believe animals cannot suffer. However it was at one time, and I maintain in that belief. Sure animals can enter the electro chemical state of pain, sure they can enter into the electro chemical state of emotional distress. Their neural system can respond to a limited extent, but they do not suffer. This is fairly consistent with a number of things, like it's OK to experiment on animals despite that we are not supposed to do evil so that good may come of it. 

>And this, I think, is where things begin to lose contact with reality. 

I tire of your condescending tone. I'm sorry that non fixed continuum of space time in concept is hard to get, that you can have multiple valid time lines centered around a supernatural event. My ultimate point was you can't dismiss a change in creation itself as a possibility. Does that mean the past isn't real? No, when you change reality, the new reality is ""real"", it did really really happen. You seek to examine the question from the assumption of constraint on the scope of change, I simply recognize that assumed constraint isn't a valid assumption. 

The funny thing is, I don't even think that is really important. Even if I grant God didn't make any big changes in the exile, maybe only sank a valley or something. I can still hold that suffering and death didn't exist before the fall, because suffering is not a mere electro-chemical reaction and death is not merely the ceasing of that reaction. 

But whatever. Easy answers don't help. I maintain, mankind allowed evil to enter creation through his free willed choice to sin. Creation was ""good"" prior to that. I've yet to hear a good rebuttal in principal for that idea. Better questions are out there about evil than this. "

"> When we talk about change, we have to respect the DEMOCRATIC process. Like it or not, it is a fact that laws against ""zoophilia"" are what the people want. 

We do not have to, but that aside......

In the US, the people once wanted Jim Crow laws, once wanted sodomy laws, and continue to aggitate for a large number of laws which would violate the freedoms of other citizens. This is certainly not unique to the Americans, as most nations have a spotty history in regard to a vocal group making demands and infringing upon others, your own history is an example there. Just because public sentiment decries something does not make prohibiting it ethical. Remember way back there one post ago when I mentioned Mill and Bentham? Gee, I wonder what they were going on about? Surely not anything related to this conversation. So are you suggesting that if a group of people can aggitate the masses against women, jews, blacks, homosexuals, catholics, buddhists, muslims, or whatever is the group du jour that it's the right thing to support or even tolerate? Have you ever heard of the tyranny of the masses?

> Most people are GLAD these laws have been introduced.

And most people were glad when religious requirements were legislated, they were happy when the Mormons were hanged, they were glad when blacks and women were powerless, they were glad when people were marched off to concentration camps. That's part of the reason a ""Democracy"" doesn't work, many people don't think logically about groups they don't like and when the majority rules, it often does so with malice.

> To turn around a majority of people 180 degrees from what they´re thinking is wishful thinking, at best.

I agree on this part. I don't want to change anyone's opinion of zoophilia. I'm 100% OK with everyone else absolutely repulsed by it. The only thing I want is for laws to be made which do not single out any group for special discrimination merely because the populace find it morally repugnant. It's unacceptable to legislate morallity and that's the entire basis of almost every ""anti-zoo"" law.

> What other ways do we have?

You pretend that this reegistration is the only remaining option, but I maintain it is not and even if it were it is not a viable option. We hashed this over in the other thread so I'm going to be pretty short here and just recap....

A registration of zoophiles......

1 singles out zoophiles for special treatment and examination. When does a reviled group get singled out for special examination and their lot improve?

2 It completely ignores all abuse done by non-zoophiles and fouses extra attention on one of the groups likely offering a greater level of care to their charges than is common. As a result, every minor injury will be touted as an excuse to further criminalize even when that injury is far more commonly caused by non-zoophiles because those non-zoos are not being examined, creating a strong bias.

3 who in their right mind would self-identify to such a system?


I think focusing on sex for any part of animal welfare is misguided attempts at moral legislaton. If a farmer abuses his livestock or another person abuses their dog does it oly matter if they were attempting to have sex with it or is it still abuse, regardless of how it happened? If it's still abuse, why are you trying to single out one small group for special harassment? If you were pushing for yearly veterinary health inspections of every domesticated animal I'd not see that as such a big problem. Even if it were limited to just ""pets"", I'd find it unwarranted but perhaps acceptable, but to single out one group for special interference by the government is unacceptable. It is the very definition of discrimination. Even more unacceptable when the exact same abuses when done by any other person would be treated differently.

> I appreciate your desire to ""legalise"" my orientation, but I also see that we´re not living in the times for that right now.

You must not recall any of our other discussions where I've pointed out that I don't care about ""legalization"", I just want to see it decriminalized, to lose it's power of harassment to anyone who isn't violating any other law aside from being morally objectionable to their neighbors.

> We have to prioritize PRIVACY...common sense is self defense.

Indeed, but privacy doesn't always save you from unjust laws. I can hide Jews in my attic, but it doesn't excuse laws which make such evasion necessary. You keep suggesting that if bestiality laws didn't exist that people would be out in every front yard banging the livestock. Is that how it used to be before it was so recently criminalized for you? Are you suddenly happy that the laws are now preventing you from thrusting your sexuality into the lives of your neighbor? Of course not, that is absurd whether it is you stating it or I. Even if bestiality were 100% legal, it still doesn't remove the social penalties of offending one's neighbors, family, and friends. All it removes is a special prohibition against a small group of people for doing something which their neighbors object to. Abuse is still abuse, it just has to be shown at that point....just like for everyone else. Public indecency is still the same too.

> And while we sit and patiently wait for OUR chance, for the next singularity opening up to place this one, gamechanging shot, you, Egoldstein, should be thankful for your Finnish prime minister and his sturdyness against Op Beast´s blackmail attempts.

Why should any of that matter to me? I'm not Finnish! I am a citizen of Oceania, and I don't mean the one in the Pacific. The country I reside in has bestiality laws and they're not especially light. The key is that those laws don't largely affect me because I don't provide evidence which can incriminate me and I wouldn't even if it weren't a crime as it's not something one does, not if one's lover is a human or otherwise; private affairs should be private.

"> You are aware that every system can be cracked and exploited, right? Every safeguard you put up will be figured out, and you'll have to come up with more and more and more every time they do. Nature of the beast.

You're oblivious. It's not simply the ""nature of the beast"". Yes every system can eventually be cracked, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't apply any safety measures. Every lock can be picked. Are you going to stop locking your house and car doors?

There are a TON of online games, with a TON of different server setups. From peer hosted servers, to huge shared servers like MMOs. Almost no other game has such a rampant hacking problem as GTA Online does. I mean I've played some really shitty multiplayer games over the years and some of them had a TON of hackers. But you could still play public servers and have a fair chance of not having your whole game ruined by them. Rockstar is doing a very sub par job on this front.

>Accept it, help solve the situation given the available methods, switch platforms, or stop playing. Your choice, but whining isn't helping.

This is just as asinine a suggestion as it was the first time you made it. There is no way for me, the end user, to solve the problem of a game being hacked. I can report users 'til I'm blue in the face, but it still doesn't help when Rockstar hardly ever responds to such reports, and helps even less, since this is all damage control rather than preventative measures. Rockstar needs to do more work, and no, it's not on the users to pick up the pieces.

Also, whining does a couple things. It vocalizes gripes with the game's current state. That makes it easier for the devs to see what's wrong and needs fixing. It also makes me feel better to get those frustrations off my chest when a game I paid for is being rendered almost unplayable. And frankly, ""quit whining"" is even more useless than whining as it adds literally nothing to the conversation.

>No, it's not. But the nature of the situation is that you can (A) help the rest of us by reporting hackers & modders, (B) find another game to play, or (C) gripe about it in this sub. Your guess is as good as mine regarding which will help make the situation better.

(A) I do. (B) Fuck you. (C) Just did. All of the above and yet none help.

>Are you not aware that hackers and modders cannot join private sessions, and thus can't mess with you there? Are you even aware private sessions exist? Do you play with a crew? Are you aware you can do that, and it actually makes the gameplay experience better? Have you experimented with free aim sessions, which aren't as populated, and don't attract as many cheaters?

Are you not aware that being relegated to private servers largely defeats the purpose of playing a multiplayer game in the first place? Are you aware that if you join crews large enough to actually fill a lobby to capacity that your chances of playing with a hacker are still pretty good? Are you aware I only play free aim and still get hackers in every session for the last 2 weeks? Are you aware that shitty fucking workarounds that prevent you from interacting with the vast majority of the userbase and from experiencing the game as it was meant to be, is not a real solution to a very real problem that needs to be fixed. Jesus fucking christ are you really that fucking ignorant as to thing this is a valid solution as opposed to Rockstar fixing their fucking BROKEN FUCKING GAME? Really?

>As I said before, there are ways around these assholes. It sucks you have to do it, but if the game is worth playing, it's worth spending a little extra time isolating yourself from the kinds of players you don't like. I don't do player combat and I don't like griefers; I discovered free-aim players are more civilized in this regard, so I switched aim preference, and the problem is solved. I rarely get attacked now, and usually a quick dip into Passive gives them the hind I'm not interested in PvP.

Again, this still doesn't fix the problem of the game being overrun by hackers. Only Rockstar can fix that. I am set for free-aim. I even just now double checked and yep, still free aim. Literally every lobby I've joined for the last two weeks, has had a hacker blowing shit up or otherwise making the server unplayable. Problem far from solved.

>No, but anyone who makes content of any kind relies on feedback from customers to give them a better experience. This subreddit is not the medium for that feedback, though. You can gripe here all you want -- I've done my fair share of venting, too -- but unless you directly deal with Rockstar, all you're doing is kicking water uphill, and getting angry at the hill because it doesn't work.

They've been given endless feedback regarding the hackers. For fucks sake there are articles about it on gaming news sites... this isn't exactly an obscure issue. This is a place to discuss the game. Even if the devs never see what's written her directly, discussing the issue isn't pointless. For one thing we're discussing it with other people who like the game. That in and of itself has value and is the reason this sub exists. Also, the more people that gripe about the same issue on a public site like this, the more people are likely to send feedback to Rockstar and the more likely a Dev may even come here to read what all the hubbub is all about. Nobody's under the delusion that griping here is actually fixing the problem directly and I have no idea why you're making the suggestion that they are.

>Have you emailed them your suggestions? Called them and offered some real-world solutions to dealing with hackers and modders? Actually useful advice, not just demands that they do ""something""?

I have given feedback actually with actual real world suggestions. Yeah real suggestions and not just ""something"".

>Oh, right ... that's not your job. Your job is to throw a temper tantrum about it on a third party medium, apparently. If so, you're doing swell!

And I take it your job is to be a condescending prick to anyone who might be expressing frustration or even naming a problem as well as possible solutions, or even so much as simply defining the problem as it exists? You expect someone to walk into Rockstar and tell the devs to move aside while they tap out the code that'll solve all the problems, or if they can't do exactly that they should just shut the fuck up? Oh wait, no you're just being a prick because you like to be a prick. Here we are having a discussion about a problem and you come in here acting like it's our fucking responsibility to actually solve that problem for the company who both created the problem and has the staff to solve it. You're chastising people for fucking typing on an open forum. You're doing that job pretty fucking swell.

You go off on a fuckload of assumptions about me with no basis for them, and once you've built up that little strawman effigy of me you try to tear it down, and then give yourself a big pat on the back for a job well done. Yep, you're a real problem solver aren't you. Glad we have people like you making shit better for the rest of us."

Condescending and false. 

I've been in that god damn relationship with a conservative catholic latino whose parents would have instantly rejected him for his sexuality. I dealt with it, but we didn't make it three years like the OP did. See my other post that I just made for more details. I briefly dated a filipino guy in a similar situation (even though his sister insisted that the whole family knew. . .)

In long term relationships, people don't always see the big picture. They get emotional, focus on the short term and their own emotions. When people suppress their emotions for a long time, eventually they surface. 

Have you ever dated a deeply closeted LGBT person? No? Then how can you condescend to tell me that I, having been in that situation on both ends, don't understand it as well as you do? 

I'm not even saying the OP was right. I'm saying that there is an emotional justification that must be understood and that everyone is excoriating her illegitimately without considering her side of the story properly. "

Just as treatment decisions ought to be based on sound assessment protocols, policies on partner abuse ought to be based on an understanding of the full range of available research, without regard to political considerations. The journal is therefore open to original research papers and articles on controversial subjects such as mutual abuse, family violence, female perpetrators, male victims, alternative types of batterer intervention programs, couples and family counseling, and the limitations of current arrest and prosecution policies such as mandatory arrest and one-size-fits-all"" mandated batterer treatment.

"> They are all based on biological drives.

Not wanting to waste/use resources on a child that doesn't carry your DNA is not a biological drive. Biologically speaking humans as a whole are programmed to care for the young. Before monogamy became a social practice and before modern medicine there was no way to establish paternity. People didn't even know children were conceived from sperm and eggs at the start of the human race. They simply knew that once a female reached a fertile age and engaged in sex she would start having children. There was no ""biological"" drive in men to find out which was theirs. They simply raised the children as a tribe. There is no evidence that monogamy was even practiced in humans before the birth of agriculture. Monogamy became a social practice so property could be passed on. This points towards monogamy being a result of our changes as a society, not something that was biologically programmed into our species.

I never said that criticizing Islam is racism or that people who do this are racist.

This is so patently incorrect. You are misrepresenting this issue as if nobody has ever said something racist about Muslims before.

>It;s the left who are the racists here.

Yup. Arguing against racism (heck, even just pointing it out) makes you a racist. And being opposed to Islam makes you the Muslim or something.

Cool rhetorical device bro.

Lotteries are designed around what is called a variable ratio schedule of reinforcement. That is why lotteries work. They give out smaller prizes for trying, and they give these smaller prizes out often. The odds of not getting one in 400 tries is like flipping 400 heads in a row. This has literally nothing to do with any one person doing it. I'm specifically discussing the odds of a prize not being won 400 times in a row. It's astronomical.

>There are millions and millions and millions of people buying lottery tickets every day, some in huge quantities.

How is this relevant? We're discussing a single odd -- 400 non-winners in a row. There are millions and millions and millions of people buying them every day, but that doesn't mean there are 500 jackpot winners. There is a chance of this happening, and it's unbelievably low based on the fact that the lottery system revolves around this not happening even moreso than it revolves around there being a jackpot.

>That is not a form of determining odds. It's a psychological mechanism, hence the word ""reinforcement"".

No shit. I really don't know what you thought you read when you read my post, but I was discussing the psychological mechanism and how it relates to - as I've reiterated above - the need to have the variable reinforcements in lottery tickets. I don't know why you would even read that as if it had anything to do with determining odds. But whenever you respond to someone's comments, you should probably attempt to understand what they are saying instead of condescendingly replying to something they weren't.

Ironically you say this after saying that there are multiple factors at play, love that little condescending line at the end too.

First of all ""across a room"". That's a pretty broad term. What are we talking about here? 9ft? 12ft? 18ft?

""on a 1080p TV""... what size? 32""? 40""? 72""?

">Assembly has plenty of data types

Assembly has 0 data types. Those all just describe the number of bits to use for the operation. And it depends on the operator as much as the operand. And again since assembly is just running the specified opcode on the specified bit pattern it doesn't really apply to this situation.

>PHP, a language that somehow manages to be even more loosely typed than JS and yet represents data types properly under the hood.

Php does the same thing as python but with less options. You've got int which is any number that has no decimal that fits within a 32 bit representation and float for any number that doesn't fit in those constraints. The value itself describes the type to php. That's option 1 as I described above.

This stuff isn't magic. In the end the processor is going to get 2 numbers and an operation. 

Python and php use the format the value itself is in to determine what the type of the value is and therefore exactly which opcode to use.

JavaScript always uses the floating point representation and floating point opcodes.

The reason that this leads to a discussion about types is when you have a type system you can directly control which opcodes are used. If your variables are defined explicitly as int then the assembler can easily know to use the int opcodes. If your variables are explicitly defined as float that translates to floating point opcodes. There's no guesswork.

">The vast majority of those 300 million+ guns will be broken, rusted out or otherwise unusable within 10 years, and you can accelerate their removal with generous tax credit and buyback programs for turning them in. And the same thing is true of high capacity magazines. Eventually, they'll break and have to be replaced, and if the only legal thing to replace them with is a low capacity magazine, well, that's what law-abiding gun owners will use, and we'll reach a point where even criminals will have a hard time getting ahold of fast-reload weapons with high capacity magazines because there won't be very many of them left around anymore. You don't see many holdups with Colt Peacemakers anymore, after all. A policy of restricting reload times to 10 seconds or greater and banning the manufacture of high capacity magazines isn't one to create a difference tomorrow, or next year, but it will have a difference 5, 10 and 20 years down the line.

This is why gun legislation discussions often go poorly. I thought you were wanting sensible gun laws, it's clear that you're not now. Have you thought about how much that would cost because it's going to be insane. If a citizen doesn't believe the tax break is fair are you going to forcefully confiscate their weapons? Had you even thought about the fact that, before Orlando, the last spree killing was done exclusively with handguns and that your policy could be completely bypassed by just carrying more weapons? I doubt it and that's the same reason we have so many idiotic laws concerning firearms now. Ignorance.

>Your mistakes with thinking that more concealed carriers will be a solution are (at least) two-fold. First, correlation doesn't equal causation. Even if I bought your assertion that concealed carriers were less likely to commit crimes than police officers, the reason for that is because the process of getting certified to conceal and carry already weeds out those inclined to commit crimes.

Actually, the mistake here is that you're unfamiliar with the subject that we're talking about. You know, the crime rates (or lack thereof) of concealed carriers? You don't have to ""buy my assertion"" since it's statistical fact. 

>Pushing more people through the process is just going to make it more likely that concealed carriers commit crimes.

Not necessarily pushing all people, but more active advertisements and convenience of obtaining a license without dropping the requirements. Expose more people to firearms and educate them, while the current requirements would weed out undesirables.

>The situation in France was a failing of local security forces during a celebration. More concealed carriers there would have been unlikely to stop that tragedy, and would have a much greater chance of making it worse by having more innocent people get caught in the crossfire.

You're really going to hand-wave away what a few trained people could have done to stop these situations? You really think it would've been that hard to send rounds into the cab of that truck without hitting people in the crowd? You don't believe it's worthwhile to try and help while dozens of people are being maimed and murdered?

>That said, lone-wolf terrorists and crazy people won't ever be stopped from trying to kill a bunch of people, and sometimes they'll succeed. The goal should be to make it as hard as possible for them to succeed keeping in mind that perfection is never going to be attainable, while minimizing the risks to everybody else.

You realize the same could be said from concealed carriers attempting to help stop the situation, right?

>Concealed carriers don't minimize those risks, they exacerbate them.

That's an incredibly ignorant and short-sighted view of concealed carriers. I mean, you should do some reading about what concealed carriers have done. (This link is to general statistics about CCs)

>The reason gun control discussions aren't fruitful is because recreational gun collectors/users value their own access to their preferred form of entertainment and dubious security over the lives of other people's children and grandchildren, and will appeal to the most spurious rhetorical fallacies to support their preferences.

Wow. That's not an ignorant assertion at all. I'm more comfortable knowing that 1 in 10 people in my state is a concealed carrier. Knowing that the possibility of a trained gun owner could be around when something bad goes down does make me feel a bit better. Those people may be part of the reason, but ignorant anti-gun people don't help their cause. Your lack of knowledge leads to those super important bans on rifles being painted black! Bans on extended magazines when replacement magazines didn't exist (limited a magazine to 7 rounds in the end). Frequently unable to recognize the difference between an AR-15 and a semi-automatic hunting rifle (hint: not much). Sen. Edward Meyer tried to make it a class C felony to own any gun designed to fire more than a single round.

>Yes, it is your legal right, but being currently legal doesn't mean that it's moral nor that it should be legal.)

That's true, but you have to offer real solutions. While I don't think it's immoral to own a gun as you seem to I think that we can start with closing loopholes in background checks. We can fund and equip the ATF to look into applications thoroughly as well as investigate false applications that lead to stiff prosecutions. We can also extend something that is required as a part of me getting my CCW - No history of mental health issues, spousal abuse, and/or stalking. That could be viewed as extreme as it could lead to some soldiers with PTSD from being able to own a gun, but there's flexibility with a reasonable start. Maybe discuss these things because I can guarantee this country will not go the way Australia did. After all, the Bill of Rights is pretty important and SCOTUS tends to agree, but we cannot ignore one of the things all spree shooters seemed to have in common because after all, we're trying to treat the cause and not the symptom.

Culture may explain their attitude, bit it does not justify it. For example, until 1993, marital rape was legal in at least some US states, go back far enough and marital rape was considered non-existent. However marital rape was always rape, regardless of whether anyone recognised it as such, legally or morally.

> What is Wack or crazy seeming depends on what is normal where you at, you gotta trust me on that one lol

No, given I wrote an undergrad thesis on moral realism I don't think I need to trust you on that one.

Homosexuality is, always was, and always will be morally permissible. Regardless of what any culture says, moral truths are objective and timeless.

Someone may disagree with me when I say that homosexuality is not immoral, and they are welcome to offer proof, but 'it's my culture' is not enough any more than it would be if they disagreed that Hilbert's first problem cannot be proved within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Disagreement is not sufficient for relativism.

Even then, like the heap of grains, how many homophobes does it take clumping together for them to no longer be a bunch of bigots but start being a culture that has to 'be respected'? Why does my individual moral values become legitimate to you only when I can justify it according to some sense of cultural tradition? Doesn't that describe most homophobes?

You may question whether OP is overreacting or not but as long as we take her at her word no, I don't consider being super close to someone legitimate reason to stalk someone, online or not.

"I'm glad to have a microbiologist weigh in on this discussion.

In my original post I did mention the CCR5-d32 allele, the relatively high frequency which as has been suggested to relate to either selection pressure from smallpox or, as I indicated in my post, plague. I was under the impression that there was no scientific consensus, as yet, to the adaptive advantage of the allele in regards to a specific pathogen. The PNAS article presents a compelling simulation to counter the plague camp in favor of the smallpox camp, but the jury is still out.

> That is how evolution works.

No need to be condescending. I understand how natural selection influences allele frequencies through differential reproductive success based on heritable traits. We study evolution in anthropology.

> A less diverse set of MHC genes (one of the key features of the adaptive immune system) indicates less adaptability in the face of challenge by potential pathogens.

I agree with the principle, but, as I mentioned in the post and subsequent comments, we do not yet know how the relative homogeneity of Amerindian HLA alleles influenced the mortality and spread of introduced infectious diseases. It makes complete sense that less HLA diversity would negatively influence the ability of each individual to mount an adaptive immune response, and perhaps less host diversity on a population level would select for specific strains of a pathogen that could exploit this homogeneity in the larger group, but I have not found any published articles to that effect (though someone linked me an article examining the response to the smallpox vaccine that I still need to read). As with the Science Daily article you linked, the extension of the immunology to history does make sense, but we haven't proven it yet, and I hesitated to add material to my post without sufficient proof.

> The death rate for influenza in western populations is 0.1 to 0.2%, or less, and death is largely limited to the very young and very old. Mortality due to influenza can be 20-30% in Amazonian indian tribes, with no prior or historical (ancestral exposure) to the virus.

This is a little misleading since we know influenza is a nasty, diverse little bugger, and the mortality in Western populations due to the virus can vary year to year based on the type and subtype, as well as previous exposure (and hard-earned adaptive immunity) to earlier epidemics. Sure, some strains are rather benign. Others act like the 1918 influenza pandemic. 

According to this Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on seasonal influenza deaths from 1976-2007 the annual rate of influenza-associated deaths in the U.S. ranged from 1.4 to 16.7 deaths per 100,000. Response to influenza can also vary based on previous exposure to the virus type or subtype, and the bulk of individuals in Western populations, except the very young, have previous exposure to influenza. Comparing two populations with different exposure to a virus will produce a biased outcome.

You have no argument from me that Amazonian populations face considerable stress from respiratory diseases when transitioning to sedentary villages. Interviews with the Ache of Paraguay (a foraging population who moved to the missions in the late 20th century) do indicate high mortality (as high as 38%) due to respiratory infections during the transition period. We assume the bulk of those infections were from influenza. Many of those who died represent people who were infected and returned to the jungle (and away from medical assistance) so we don't know how the mortality figures might change with adequate medical care.

I do not agree with the assumption that they have no prior or historical (ancestral) exposure to the virus. We have no way of knowing what pathogens penetrated the interior of the continent in the >500 years since contact. Analysis of Northern Plains Winter Counts indicate the periodic wave-like nature of epidemic spread, with years (perhaps even a generation) between high mortality events. Maybe the Ache's ancestors encountered influenza, maybe not, but based on evidence from other portions of the Americas there is sufficient reason to believe pathogens can penetrate the interior of a continent, even among dispersed foraging populations.

I appreciate your insights, and would love to read any sources you can provide to aid my understanding of these topics."

This sounds like a hypothetical situation. 




So basically your argument against free trade is that the poorer country is forced (somehow) to work in factories. This is unsupported by you, but whatever.

Not 'only'. If you really think all anti-imperialist revolutions have just been ""politics of demand"" then I can't really argue that, because you obviously think anything that isn't anarchist and anti-state is some liberal protesting asking to be ""recognized""

> This is a huge oversimplification and very much feels like an attempt to fit contemporary developments into old theoretical frameworks that don't suit them 

If you don't want oversimplifications I can recommend books that go into greater detail. IDK what is so crazy about the fact of semi-feudalism still existing. Look at the Philippines, Afghanistan, pretty much any country dominated by imperialism. These relationships exist. The capitalist mode of production didn't develop in equal ways all across the world at the same time, and remnants of feudalism are common in the global south.

> Really, saying contemporary imperialism blocks ""developments towards industrialisation"" just suggests to me that you haven't actually read much literature on modern geopolitics

You're very good at being condescending but not actually making arguments. 

> More to the point I have no idea why you would say that if you apparently knew globalisation is leading to huge industrial growth in urban centres of the developing world? And must have therefore also known that industrial manufacturing is the backbone of many developing economies?

Because theres more to imperialism than what happens in the cities. Plus, its the semi-feudal social structures between the landowning bourgeoisie and imperialist monopoly interests which forces rural populations to labor on the land to repay debts and meet the quotas of landowners, while the outward flow of surplus labor from the countryside to urban labor markets (which are restricted by foreign imperialist monopolies and oligopolies) creates downward pressure on wages which is why we often refer to the proletariat of the global south as ""super-exploited"". The land is prevented from undergoing agrarian reform (which has historically been done by either a free market in land and labor or the collectivization of land and its redistribution) because the maintenance of small plots being managed by poor farmers is beneficial to capitalists' in the imperialist centers who rely on the labor of those in the periphery.

> Sorry, you can't have capitalist exchange without capital. And you especially now can't have global capitalist exchange without global capital

I'm not just talking about capital, or trade, I'm talking about global chains of value transfer which are essentially just lines from the global south to the global north. I'm talking about the exploitation and extraction of value and resources from whole countries by imperialist ones. Thats very different from simply ""trade"".

> Right then. So what did he mean by this?

He's talking about the historic development of socialism as a theory. And he's not wrong, at the time of writing that pretty much all major socialist theoreticians were of the intelligentsia, and workers were mainly only involved in trade unions (the ""exclusively and by their own effort"" clause is very important in this paragraph too, because he's not at all saying that the working class can't do stuff more revolutionary than trade union work). Its not arguing that the intelligentsia should be treated as greater or more revolutionary than the workers, but that this class divide was something that needed to be reckoned with in Revolutionary Russia. But ""What is to be Done?"" is typically not at all a very critical work for actually learning what Leninism is about, and really isn't at all that relevant to this debate thread, so I'm gonna drop it (and suggest you do too).

> And my point is that the viability of ""proletarian leadership"" within liberal institutions such as the nation-state is not very good

The state isn't an institution of liberalism, its an institution of class society. Until class is abolished, and in the necessary period where the proletariat will have to hold power over the bourgeoisie, talking about ""proletarian leadership"" not only makes sense, but is necessary in determining the political line of movements and states.

> cooperation (what you might call collaboration) with capitalist classes, which always leads to the submission of proletarian interests to capital.

It doesn't though. It only does when the leadership of the proletariat is abandoned and is liquidated into the bourgeoisie. Thats what happened in Indonesia. But when the bourgeoisie is kept under the direction of the proletariat and is held in check by a proletarian-led state, the interests of capital can be subsided and liquidated by the interests of the proletariat. Thats basically what happened with the NEP. Its also what happened with the period of New Democracy in China.

I know you don't think those countries are socialist or led by the proletariat, and seeing as how this thread isn't about the history of these states I think its generally a topic we should leave aside for now"
"> First, you are saying that I do not understand the community. That's exactly why I posted this, so I could better understand the needs of DNs. 

While I appreciate you trying, imagine if you changed DNs with RNs (nurses). How would that come off? ""I know very little about you and have zero experience being a nurse, but I'm going to post on a forum, get your feedback, and build a product to help you!"" Pretty arrogant. Would you invest in a guy who said he talked to a few nurses and is building a product? This is why I suggested actually going on such a trip. Learn from others. Live with us. Figure out our problems and devise solutions. You can't be a nurse just by wandering in a hospital, but you can be a DN by working alongside us.

> The 5k is steep. I know. I wanted a security deposit in case something happens and also to keep people from treating this like a vacation. I am looking at it as if your'e renting an apartment and put down a security deposit and first months rent. 

So 4k is fine? Sorry, this is a rookie mistake expecting your clients to shoulder 100% of the risk; would you or your friends trust a stranger with that much money? Again, you don't seem to know your clients: you're asking 1-2 months' expenses upfront because you don't trust them while offering no reason why they should trust you.

> keep people from treating this like a vacation

It's none of your business to tell us how to run OUR businesses or lives. That's arrogant and condescending.

> I will change this to 4K down and this includes first months payment and 2K is held as security and returned later.

I don't know where you're from, but I pay 1/2 month deposit and first month rent when I inspect the place and move in; unless there's a third party like AirBnb holding my money in escrow, there's no way I'm forking over the cash and hoping things will work out or you'll be nice enough to give me my money back.

> Price: I came to the price of this service by considering my competition's price and also the research I did on the what it will cost me to provide these services. Here is the breakdown: Hackers 2K per month (Does not include travel to the next location) RemoteYear: 2K/month + 3k down payment to reserve your spot.

First off, I'm not impressed with Remoteyear. A year is a huge commitment. I don't particularly think they're offering great value either; besides Kyoto, all of their destinations are fairly budget. Besides 3 large international flights, the transport costs are very low and uncomplicated. Again, 1 mo/city is actually quite rushed.

I like Hacker Paradise's model better. Again, more flexibility, less rush. Considering they're going to more expensive destinations, their costs and value are better. $2000/mo in Tokyo is not bad, but Taipei is half as much; I spent $1500 on everything and did whatever the heck I wanted. I really don't understand why these businesses have a ""one price fits all"" mentality when they're going from drastically different places.

> Here is my breakdown of the major costs: Co-working space: ~$100 to $650/month depending on location. Accommodations: ~$500-$1,000/month depending on location. Travel to the next location: Depends on mode of transportation and the destination. Within the region shouldn't be too expensive, but outside the region can be up to 2k. Looking at these costs please explain to me how I am making $625/month per person? I don't think I am being greedy trying to make 10-15%.

I really dispute those costs, especially when you're factoring group savings/discounts. Also, having to include 12 major moves is going to unnecessarily increase costs. You could visit 3-6 places for a fraction of the price. 

> Competition: They are going to a place off the cost of Valenzuela, so of course they are going to be able to get more. I will be losing money going to places like Croatia, Prague and Tokyo. So, I will need to make up that lost money when I go to SE Asia and South America.

That's really not your customers' problem; when a business whines about ""losing money"" by selling me something, I know they're full of shit. When you balance it out between budget and expenses destinations, and even include a few large flights, the average cost should be hundreds less than what you're asking. You're justifiably afraid of being left holding the bag, but you can't expect your clients to shoulder 100% of risk by having a massive markup. 

> Your last point is a good one. I have been looking into going on one of these trips to experience it first hand. Also, I am a trying to bring on a partner that is a DN. He is a friend of a friend and travels 6 months out of the year.

I'm glad to hear you're considering that. Actually I have a suggestion: go on a trip with just your friend. Seek out and meet DNs, talk to them, befriend them, figure out what they want, and then invite those people to participate. If you can convince a few people to get on board, you have a valid idea. If not, you need to rethink it.

> Even though some of your comments were pretty harsh thanks for the tips and recommendations.

I'm harsh because (A) I've personally been through the ""wantrepreneur"" process of thinking I can do something I know nothing about without adding value and charge for it and (B) because there's an incessant march of people like you trying to make a buck off others without clearly explain why you deserve it.

I picked ages that were toward the extreme in order to make this very obvious, and I wouldn't actually say that the area between them is a no-man's land. I did not leave that area open to interpretation. I gave some criteria that could be used to evaluate people who didn't fall obviously to one side. At no point did I claim that they were the only possible criteria.

12 and 25 were numbers that I picked with the considerable variation between different humans in mind. As I have explained in other comments, that range is considerably narrowed when we examine a single individual.

Not to be that asshole but this is a common sensor in every phone. I don't know why you're assuming only the iPhone has this.

There is a proximity sensor in nearly every phone and they're typically at the top near the front camera. The phone uses this to tell whether you have it up to your ear or not when in a phone call. 

The iPhone has this sensor as well so you're not wrong. But seriously man check your facts before condescendingly telling me I'm wrong. If I am wrong please provide me with proof that the Nexus 6P doesn't operate this way and I'll be glad to admit I was wrong.

Thanks, I was hoping you would do that work to help yourself understand, since your posts on this have been so sarcastic, dismissive and uninformed.

Now that you've shown yourself what hard data means, please see my post in reply to you here:  http 

I even showed you how to create a pretty little graph from the hard data that EA disclosed, just like you wanted! And I didn't even know you were going to make reference to a graph. Does this help you understand? Good job! Enjoy!

Edit to add: You may argue that the graph I sarcastically (response in kind with your condescending, sarcastic, insulting comments to me here) discuss with you is somehow uninformative simply because we don't have exact revenue levels to reference at each point in time. But this isn't true. The graph may not be exact, but it is informative. It tells us that revenue declined (so sharply that EA was forced to disclose the bad news about the game in both preceding years) and that, at least temporarily, the subscribers and/or revenue run rate spiked back up. Even though we don't have exact revenue or subscriber figures, the graph is informative as fitting it to any actual revenue figures would, in mathematical terms, merely be a diffeomorphic operation and each graph's derivatives would share the same sign (positive or negative) at each point. In other words, the trend would be preserved, even if the absolute values can't be precisely specified. Thus we have hard information and good insight to work with here, even if it isn't complete. But again, please do teach me more as I clearly am a dummy."

"> SAF does not get everything 100% right, no manager or person does. When we say we want x player to come off, you have no right or knowledge of knowing whether objectively that is the best decision possible. Fergie is continuing to get it wrong with Valencia, as he has done all season, that right there is one way by fact that calls to play Nani or even Welbeck over him is true.

Exactly we don't know what's best, no one does, but the person who can make the most sensible and best decision is Fergie. The problem with the Valencia situation is that when Nani's played he hasn't exactly been brilliant and when we've played without wingers, the narrow diamond it hasn't worked so he's the only player that can provide that width, at least for now.

> So.. let me get this straight.
You dislike people who criticize Fergie because a person said he should quit.
You dislike people who criticize players because they said Rooney should be sold.
Seems more like your inability to distinguish trolls and idiots rather than the general views of standard fans not being something you like.

The Fergie quit post was almost certainly a troll but why are so many United fans calling on one of our most consistent and key players to be sold?

"> I would assume overly-emotional and moronic sheep.

I forgot ""condescending"" too. It's because of comments like this, for one. 

Religious people often associate ""emotion"" with ""sensitivity"". The lack of many atheists to be sensitive to the emotions of others characterizes them this way. At least, that's from my observation. Now, I myself have found that not to be true as I dug further into atheist literature. Dawkins seems condescending at times, but you can tell he has a passion to see others love nature like he does. Dan Barker is a very funny and happy guy. Neil deGrasse Tyson is exuberant and has a passion for exploration. Christians don't often see these people because they put blinders on. They're told it's best to avoid any ungodliness, ergo...atheists. So, yes...you could call them sheeple, but they're mainly deceived. I think they have an excuse because they are trapped in a society that pushes them this way. I can't be the only person in this subreddit who realized religion isn't always a choice."

">You want a citation to a folk way that is a lot more than 7000 years old? you .net Pagans are amusing. Have you ever considered visiting, or even living amongst people still practising the old ways?

If that ""folk way"" persisted for seven thousand years, there would be material record of it. And the Proto Indo-Europeans had at least coalesced into the Yamna culture over eight thousand years ago, smartass, so there's already a point against your grasp of history.

But that's only added to the marks against you for making claims about the nature of the gods that are not present in the historical record for any culture. Those claims are present in Romanticist drek that presumes Euhemerism to somehow have been proven fact at some murky point in the past. The ancient records, which you claim my ignorance of, extend to a whopping single reference in Phaedrus and Cretans claiming that Zeus was buried on their island circa the 7th century BCE.

And all of that, mind, can be traced to what basically amounts to Euhemerus being confused about how pharaonic apotheosis worked and getting his information ass-backwards.

Modern Euhemerism basically amounts to medieval Christians downplaying the very gods they were competing with during conversions of the masses. Gee, I wonder why they were so eager to claim the gods were not gods. Really makes you think. What possible reason they could have for that, those Christians?

Beyond that, it's essentially Bullfinch and other romanticists in the 18th and 19th century. I give them a bit of a pass because they were at least trying and didn't know any better. But in 2015, there is no excuse other than deliberate, willful ignorance.

Not because it's bad theology, but because it's bad anthropology, archaeology, and historical science. Euhemerus applied irrelevant beliefs to his own, and those ideas got manipulated by a competing organization for cultural hegemony, and we know all of this.

>you .net Pagans are amusing.

You Romanticist holdouts are infuriating, because by repeating this bad information you completely fuck up new believers' ability to actually learn anything useful related to their paths. It clogs search engines and insidiously hides in otherwise useful sites. And you all act so condescending and high and mighty when challenged on it, as if your fanciful takes on the actual historical records is more accurate than the work done by trained historical scientists.

>Have you ever considered visiting, or even living amongst people still practising the old ways?

And then there's this predictable nonsense. Those people don't exist. Because they died millennia ago. There are holdouts of culture and folklore, like in Eastern Europe and Scotland, but otherwise, on the European continent, the closest we have to an ""unbroken lineage"" is the fucking Catholic Church because they appropriated everything they could get their grubby fat hands on.

And as for modern culture, I am so sorry I have limited resources, two jobs, and a child, and a life outside paganism, that I haven't had time to erect a fucking maypole or whatever downtown and build some fun commune. I have shit to do. So with my free time I do my research, bit by bit, and thank fuck I have JSTOR access and don't have to simply rely on google.

"The civil response is very much appreciated. It's nice to have a discussion of the more light-hearted variety, so to speak.

> I disagree with your first paragraph. Too subjective so not worth arguing back and forth

I would disagree if only because the usage of strong language is generally frowned upon (which is also why there's other posts, which I agree with, that mention OP's language usage). As for other potential concepts such as ""letting off steam"", there's plenty of evidence that can be derived from common sense that shows it's possible for someone to have trouble containing their (negative) emotions due to stress, among other things.

> Your 2nd paragraph obviously has a lot of truth to it ... (etc)

First of all, I'm going to drop these two videos (skip to about 5:20 in the second video for a very important statement) here since they're pretty relevant to how you feel about the concepts of game difficulty and how people should handle them. 

As for your philosophy, WoW is intended to be pretty approachable to begin with, but it's still far from actually truly accomplishing its goal (as I mentioned in another reply, the lack of a decent tutorial in-game is one such contributing factor). In addition (which I sort of mentioned above), WoW's gameplay has made a very strong transition towards linearity and fast travel while reducing obscurity from questing and the like, with exploration being more of a side concept, that is rewarding in itself, but not necessarily the primary aspect of the game (seriously, you can go right to a quest hub by talking to a certain NPC and quest objectives show up on the map and the like). The point is the game is intended to be appealing to more people but it's not quite there yet.

> I find that pathetic.

> Go play Tetris if you don't like a regular RPG open world.

So maybe you do, but that doesn't mean you have to be unwelcoming and hostile (and condescending and akin to making personal attacks) to the people who do happen to complain. That in itself is a very negative behavior that's pretty much unjustifiable since at the very basic level it is verbally abusing another human being for something that is pretty much inconsequential overall. If you wish you can feel free to keep that mindset (to yourself, preferably) but in my opinion it's an unhealthy one to have since it builds resent towards individuals and fuels personal ego to dangerous levels (due to essentially having a superiority complex by believing others are inferior). In short, it's a pretty negative outlook that's not even necessarily rational.

> I also don't understand your ""Who is this everyone else"" question, it would be the WoW players from the past years who haven't cried about actually having to find a dungeon portal.

Well the thing is not everyone else may necessarily agree with your statements and it is also an assumption which is likely not true. There appear to be quite a few anecdotes of other players experiencing the same problem OP describes and just by studying the current state of the game it's easy enough to understand why. I would explain in detail but it would probably break the character limit of this post so the TL;DR is pretty much ""the game's current design, among other factors, adds to the cryptic aspects of trying to find the instance portal after a wipe.""

> Your 3rd paragraph is disappointing, because I think the meaning of ""responding"" is fairly obvious there….

I know you were probably not truly being serious in the literal sense, but my point still stands that your line of statements is essentially hypocritical in a way. You even describe a bit of why:

> I'm pretty sure I'm entitled to having this opinion, and that it is a valid one regardless of agreement on the behalf of others.

Unless I’m understanding this incorrectly, you essentially believe your opinion to be correct regardless of what others say. This is a bit dangerous especially given how I already mentioned you seem to have a bit of an issue regarding a large ego. With that in mind, individuals with the entitlement complex you mention are generally, as you say (though regarding something else), self-centered by nature. This is because they’re under the belief that if they should have something they should have it no matter what (or something along those lines). Plugging in what you just said here, you believe your opinion should be considered valid no matter what. 

Pretty much, there’s a strong chance that you and the “entitled” individuals you mentioned in your top-level response are very similar, as I’m mentioned in some form a few times already, which is hypocrisy since by making the statement you did, you are trying to discount yourself from that group. Incidentally, “rudeness” is another trait that has some correlation with those individuals because they have a tendency to tantrum when things don’t go their way, which is what makes them supposedly so detestable.

This should hopefully answer both points 3 and (parts of) 4 and probably a good chunk of what you said after…

> Also, everyone's behaviour is more validated for themselves than other people's. That's logically redundant, as I see it any way.

An understandable outlook. It is indeed true that people have a tendency to think a little more of themselves because that is the nature of ego. However, while having some semblance of a personal ego can be positive (it helps fight off low self-esteem and helps make you more determined and being more sure of yourself, etc), having too much ego, which I’ve mentioned you probably have given what I said a few paragraphs ago, can lead to issues related to delusions of grandeur, superiority complexes, and otherwise believing it’s okay to look down upon people.

In short, having some ego is okay. It’s important to tend to your own state of mind. However, that doesn’t mean it’s okay to believe the state of minds of others are so inferior that they’re generally not worth listening to (with exceptions) and worse, worth berating over.

> People who use that word, especially online, tend to be extremely sensitive, anxious and - worst of all - self-centered.

That seems awfully situational, though I will say that maybe the criticism to follow up on saying “you’re rude and arrogant” could’ve been stronger to actually explain why but he (or she) does make some points. Also it’s generally not that bad to be the first two traits you listed. People’s sensitivities can vary a little and anxiety is a normal byproduct of various circumstances. There are some situations where either (or both) can be bad (as in getting too offended by a statement or having trouble accepting criticism because one believes it’s abuse due to being too sensitive and/or anxious and/or even self-centered), but those are generally fringe cases that are resultant of something akin to a psychological disorder.

It’s also worth pointing out that you choose to judge others as self-centered when you (based on numerous statements above), are probably also very much self-centered. I’m not sure if you realize that and also, it is in a way hypocrisy (a pot calling a kettle black).

> … your final paragraph puzzled me quite a bit. …

I was really more trying to make a point than anything (to be honest I had to look over your statement a few times to get a good grasp on it since my brain decided to stall). It was probably a little too ambitiously made and thus could’ve been clearer, but I’m still under the impression that you argue from authority and probably didn’t make it too clear that it’s due to believing yourself superior due to what I think is a large ego based on your statements. My question still stands as well."
"> I have no idea what you're talking about.

Marriage comes with benefits. You have a right to freely associate with people, so you have a right to live with your loved one and have a get together and get married by your priest/rabbi/friend/whatever. But what is up for debate is how the state views your marriage. That comes with benefits, and those benefits cost the taxpayer money. Sometimes it's tax breaks, sometimes it's being given compensation if your spouse dies in war, etc. The reason why society foots the bill for these expense is because marriage is GOOD for society. One of the reasons (not the only reason) it is good for society is procreation. So I don't have to explain to you why I'm ""denying"" you your right, you have to explain to me why I should pay for your marriage.

>Marriage, the institution, has existed in many forms and for many reasons. Used to be, women were treated like property via marriage.

When has marriage not been about the pair-bonding of man and woman? Because I promise you whatever obscure example you find on google is going to be basically non-existent in scale compared to the countless examples throughout the world and throughout world history of it being between a man and a woman.

>And yes, why define marriage as being between the two sexes? Answer that for me.

I just did, but I guess I'll do so again. Because it is tied to our biology and the way we reproduce and rear children. We need new people to continue the species, which takes men and women. We need those children to be raised with good values, which is more likely to occur in a stable household with two parents. Again, do you think civilizations around the world all came to the same conclusion just by coincidence?

>Why does it matter how marriage is defined? What exactly happens when we redefine it? Will couples stop reproducing?

Couples already are reproducing less. Birthrates in the western world are very low. Marriage rates are declining, and single motherhood is on the rise. I don't know what exactly will happen to marriage if we redefine it, but these are long term cultural issues. It's not like as soon as the first gay person gets married everybody gets divorced or stops having kids. It's about trends.

>Oh, so it isn't very important then to prevent infertile people from marrying. So why is it important to prevent gay people from marrying?

First of all, that's not what I said at all. I said it wouldn't be feasible to test for infertility. Second, I don't think it's all that important either way. But just because it's not all that important doesn't mean I'm wrong. The downside to the state recognizing gay marriage is inefficiency. We're spending money on something that we don't get as much out of. How inefficient it is I have no idea.

>Why would they have a point? What's the point, precisely?

The point is that society is expending resources to protect something that has less of an interest in protecting. I mean seriously, do you even understand what this debate is about? Because you are extremely condescending to people on the other side while at the same time appear to be shockingly uninformed about what this is actually about.

"> I'm not sure I agree that asking you why you felt the need to twist my words is pedantic.

That's not twisting your words. It's a reasonable inference, and since I'm the one proposing canceling early-morning seminary, I really don't see how you take offense to that.

>You also didn't answer my question. I wonder why that was?

Fine. It's because I changed the subject of the sentence. The flip side of ""supporting a major anti-suicide initiative like seminary"" is not supporting it. A logical inference of ""not supporting"" a program is canceling it. Additionally, the idea that the sentence conveys is that my motives were tied to seminary being an ""anti suicide"" program. How you could possibly take offense at this boggles my mind, especially when you refuse to see how a phrase like ""Please: go on"" is meant to be dismissive and condescending.

>You were the one who indexed seminary to church by calling it ""redundant.""

That response makes no sense in relation to the quote you're responding to: ""I have to assume you understand that at some level."" The thing I have to assume you understand, although now I'm beginning to doubt that, is that the fact that church attendance links positively with reducing suicide does not imply that adding extra meetings via early morning seminary is a ""major anti-suicide initiative."" 

Since that's what I was referring to, I don't get how bringing up that I ""indexed seminary to church"" by calling it ""redundant"" is supposed to address that.

Obamas was the strongest contrast to Bush. He was believable. McCain is a falcon and people didn't want that after the Bush years. That and probably many more reasons. And Obama also was a respected politician. He was a senator, that's something. He had a clean record. He wasn't a buffon stumbling into the election. If anything he was kinda an outsider with a name that was strange to many.

>McCain losing to that though? If that didn't wake you up to what Americans really value, I'm not sure why the Trump election would be different.

I don't see how McCains campaign was either that strong or that weak that a win for either side was inevitable. I also can't see how that election campaign was that worse that facts didn't matter and it was only about feelings. People exchanged arguments and didn't just throw dirt. McCain even publicitly defended Obama as a person on his own rally. That's very honorable.

">Intellectual property is .... wait for it.... PROPERTY.

Except that it isn't. You won't find IP in a property law textbook because the ""property"" in ""intellectual property"" does not mean the same thing as ""property"" in the law of property. It is intangible, it is loss-less, and it involves rights in personam. In property law, those with good title are said to have rights in rem because there is an actual thing to have a right to maintain personal dominion over; in intellectual property law, those with intellectual property rights are said to have rights in personam because there is no actual thing to possess, there are merely statutory obligations on the part of others that allow actions for damages or injunctive relief to arise from their actions.

>If a person or group has a patent on that property and you take it without permission, then you are stealing it.

Only if you use a completely different meaning of ""stealing"" to that used by the law, which seems patently absurd when you're arguing about the law. There is no legal definition of theft in any jurisdiction I am aware of that would include infringement of intellectual property rights, which is exactly why legislatures had to pass new statutes creating civil obligations arising out of the use of information certain parties have IP rights over.

>You have some pretty bizarre reality of your own, claiming that because there is no transfer of money when you duplicate information that there is no harm.

I didn't say there was no harm, I said there was no loss. This is true. Because IP only involves in personam obligations, not possession or title, a person whose IP rights are infringed is in no worse off a position post infringement than prior to it. Therefore, one cannot say that they have lost anything, because they did not have anything to begin with.

> If you duplicate information without paying for it, then you have deprived the owner of money.

No, you have deprived the rights-holder of their statutory right to control distribution. The distinction is subtle, but subtleties are important in law.

>By saying no transfer, no problem, is effectively disregarding patents which would allow any company or group or individual to copy information and products from anyone without reprocussion. This would limit investment to large enough groups that can control products, which is why we have patents.

I never said there was no problem. You seem to be completely ignoring the second paragraph of my second post where I clearly stated that there are valid arguments for intellectual property rights. Allowing creators to profit off their works, and thus encouraging the creation of future works by ensuring that creators can recoup their losses in creating works, is one of them. However, that does not mean that you can call IP infringement theft, because theft is defined as depriving a good possessor (which is to say a possessor whose possession is good against all current challengers) of possession, and you cannot possess intellectual property because possession requires physical control, and IP is intangible information, because it is not really property as the law recognises the term, and theft is a property crime, and because IP laws protect rights in personam against those who violate statutory obligations, whereas property laws protect rights in rem against those who violate rights in the thing itself. As there is no thing itself in intellectual property, and established law is clear on this, your argument is simply in error.

Next time before being so condescending you might want to consider actually doing the research, because browsing Wikipedia and noticing the word ""property"" in the phrase ""intellectual property"" isn't really sufficient."

Cannot stress enough how little credit you get for this. Trump is a particularly stupid sociopath. His election proves that massive portions of America are capable of doing something deeply evil. The calculus that Donald Trump meaningfully increases the risk of nuclear war should cause anyone thinking of voting for him to be institutionalized in an insane asylum, but here we are. Millions of people are bat shit insane, you are I suppose at least better than that. You get no brownie points for not doing a deeply evil thing.

> A lot of conservatives voted Hillary or abstained. 

This is factually inaccurate, the fact that conservatives held their nose and voted for him while leftists demanded purity at much higher levels than conservatives valued basic decency is why Trump is President. The horrible evil conservatives have done to this country should never be forgotten and while we should fight for a better future for all Americans, they deserve all the horrible things that will happen to them thanks to libertarian and conservative economics destroying their lives. That they take decent people down with them is a tragedy.

> Trump won because of the electoral college and gerrymandering not because of libertarians.

Well, the incredibly high % of libertarians who voted for him in gerrymandered states where some thousands votes made quite a difference certainly helped elect Trump. It's delusional to imagine otherwise, but I suspect you're not delusional and instead just feel a need to get defensive about your morally bankrupt ideology filled with hateful bigots who wear it like a comfortable coat to cover up their more pressing intentions of fucking over minorities and the poor.

> Libertarians believe in civil liberties they just don't believe in giving the government money and power to create civil liberties.

This is exactly what Republicans say to ensure they can deny civil liberties. This idea of ""created"" civil liberties brought into existence through ""government money"" strikes me as being the sort of idiotic drivel no one could seriously believe if they think about it for a second.

Tim Scott does not make the Republican party less racist. Tim Scott does not make the Republican voters of South Carolina less racist, either. The ""I have many black friends"" argument is laughably bad. You literally cited someone who uses the language of TRP (and literally calls herself red pill, so no weaseling out of that association) which is verifiably filled with virulent racists whose primary goal is to subjugate women and non-white people. That there is a useful idiot who is a black woman helping them do that is evidence that you're a bit ignorant to what's going on around you as well, not that there is nothing racist about taking social programs away from black people (it gets taken away from white people too, but the way it's sold to conservatives is to dogwhistle racism. Or for Trump, to bull horn racism).

A protest is only effective if, by definition, it actually produces the desired effect, in this case being to, I guess, change people's political beliefs. But that's not what happened. It made people angry, laugh, and even convinced some foreigners to support the opposite side that the author wanted them to.

If he wants to use what little fame he has as a soapbox to state his political opinions, then that's his right to do and no one is wronged by him doing it.

I don't agree that his fans are owed his works. I never said I did. I've constantly said he's within his rights to do whatever he wants with his mod. That doesn't mean it's not a jerk move. Just because nothing is technically owed doesn't mean that he can't be criticized for his decision.

When a video game company cancels a game that everyone's excited for, or shuts down the servers for a (let's say free) game that a lot of people are still playing, and people start criticizing the company for doing so, would you tell those people ""Hey, they don't owe you anything, so you shouldn't be complaining""?

His manner isn't just accusatory, it's completely holier-than-thou. He's presumptuously saying that the other guy is some kind of Nazi, and basically saying ""Repent your degenerate political beliefs, and I'll rerelease my mods."" Again, ""I await your response with great relish."" If you don't think there's something condescending about that, I don't know what to tell you.

And then when the other guy responds in a reasonable and calm manner, trying to clarify his views and maybe have a dialogue with the guy saying ""I'd love to go in-depth about why I agree or disagree with each of the groups you've listed."" A mature, rational response that's not being condescending or antagonistic, and instead trying to have a respectful discussion about disagreements so that they can come to an understanding and maybe learn from each other. THIS is how you effectively convince people about something, not by simply inconveniencing people and spewing propaganda like you have all the answers and everyone else is just a brainless peon.

The author's response? ""See you on the battlefield."" Completely disinterested in having any kind of meaningful or mature discussion. That's not ""growing a conscience""; he just wants to sit and demonize people he disagrees with and will only talk to them if they kneel and renounce the beliefs he disagrees with, and to that effect, use his silly mods as leverage, as though they're worth it. It's the equivalent of a child only letting other kids play with his toys if they agree to like all the same things as he does. That's not what I call mature."

This isn't it.

Like I said, it all boils down to interpretation. The Catholics consider the New Testament Bible 2.0. There's some stuff the Old Testament, but they consider it updated by the New one. That's the reason Christians can eat pork, Christians can be of any nationality and why they don't have to get circumcised, and, yes, the reason Catholics depict God in art now. In that respect, Christianity was (and pretty much still is) a Jewish sect. They pretty much worship the same God, they just have a different understanding of Him. And that's between Christians and Jews, whose faith and practices differ dramatically. Compared to that, differences between and Protestants are purely cosmetic.

As I noted, SFF authors already more radical, on average, than the population as a whole. Perhaps more to the point, a fair number of them are radical, but not in the direction of economic systems. There is no necessary relationship between economic radicalism and social radicalism.

"> No I think you'll find what I actually said is that companies like Lyft and Uber actively work to ensure the public transport system is bad.

And if the public transportation system hadn't already been so abysmal, Uber and Lyft would never have had an in to the market to begin with. Uber didn't show up out of nowhere in the last decade and destroy a thriving, successful public transportation infrastructure. They emerged because the existing infrastructure was, in far too many places, horribly inadequate. For the people who need the transportation offered, the good done by Lyft and Uber cannot help but outweigh their many, many problems.

Hell, in some places public transportation actually depends on Uber to cover their own shortcomings. Washington, DC, for one, has what was once and should be a great public transportation system in Metrorail and Metrobus. However, those services have been substantially underfunded and unsupported by Congress since the 1990s, and, as a result, the infrastructure has deteriorated and service has been scaled back. In the past few years, the Metro has contracted to Uber to provide late-night service in lieu of being able to keep the trains running into the early morning, or to provide bridges between stations closed for maintenance. If Uber wasn't around, it's not as if Metro would magically have the extra money needed to keep everything open and running as much as they'd like, or need, to. All it means is that they'd not be able to offer anything to their prospective riders.

Again, you're not wrong. But you confuse cause for effect, and ignore the fact that getting rid of Uber doesn't actually, in and of itself, make transportation options any better, it makes them worse.

> Thankfully, I'm also for investing in public transport. It's almost like people can support two things at once and every single stance you take doesn't have to solve every problem by itself.

That's wonderful. You've met and exceeded the ""not a complete asshole"" hurdle with aplomb. But people like you and I have supported investing in public transport for decades. It hasn't helped substantially, and the situation has, if anything and in a lot of places, gotten worse over time. That doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile goal, but if you can't recognize that the chances of it solving this real issue in a timely, reasonable fashion aren't particularly high, and that some sort of stop gap, at least, is necessary while we work towards a better long-term solution, then you're not actually helping anyone. Marie Antoinette didn't actually want the peasants to starve, but that didn't change the outcome. When you take away the transportation that people rely on, you are hurting them, even if you don't want to, and even if you really, really want to offer them an alternative that, realistically, won't be forthcoming.

>They are normal people who spent their entire lives there and just want to live in peace.

I believe that. And this is why they retain a right to live in the country they came illegally to and they can naturalize and apply for a citizenship. Many have, others have not and complain for some racist reason.

>And that's the root of the problem. For you, Russians are just ""hostile foreigners"".

The fact that they came here as foreigners using force may be a reason for this.

>But most of them (like most of the people in any developed country) just want to live a normal life.

They are living a normal life. Yet you cannot move to a new country and make it adapt to your culture - you have to adapt to its culture.

The things neymar could do the ball at his feet aged 18 are far beyond Mbappe's current ability.

Also the Brazilian League isn't that far behind Ligue 1 and Mbappe played on a team whose squad shits on any rival not named PSG in term of quality.

> Hazard at 18 had 6 goals and 4 assists! Better than Mbappe my ass! He also didn't have better stats than Mbappe neither as 19 yo, nor as 20 and 21 yo. He has also never shined as much as Mbappe in CL in his whole career.

Do your research better.

Hazard in 2009-10 had 5 goals 8 assists in Ligue 1 on a side that wasn't half as good as Monaco's and he was a winger not a striker playing alongside Falcao.

Furthermore Hazard was just like neymar a way better playmaker and dribbler than Mbappe.

Secondly you said Hazard didn't have better stats at age 21?

20 goals 16 assists in Ligue 1 11/12 best player in the League by far.

> Leo Messi as an 18 yo had 9 goals and 8 assists. At 19 he had 17 goals and 4 assists and at 20 he had 16 goals and 16 assists. He wasn't as clinical as Mbappe was when he was 18 though it's pretty clear that the chance of Mbappe reaching Messi's level is pretty slim and close to 0.

Leo Messi = Winger playing in La Liga.

Mbappe = Striker playing in Ligue 1.

Messi was much better ability wise, anybody with eyes can see that, Messi could dribble an entire field of players aged 18 and make world class defenders looks silly."
"sigh I had to come home to this confused mess. Are you really so arrogant as to suppose that no-one, ever, in the entire history of the church has adequately answered these questions? If you're going to dwell in the /r/atheism hivemind of course you wouldn't. As someone who was raised an atheist, became a deist and then converted to Christianity I'm just going to give you a hint; following a social trend and bathing oneself in an environment that's almost completely cut off from external criticism and picking a worldview that's the easiest to stomach does not make you a freethinker. Looking through your arguments and seeing that your metaphysics are so underdeveloped as to think that everything, even necessary agents require a cause or being ignorant of the exegetical themes in the Bible like Jesus' frequent employment of parables renders your emotion-charged critique entirely innocuous. 

The quote you pulled from wikipedia seems confused. Most religious scholars concede that Judaism, the first monetheistic world religion sprung up ex nihilo. Secular and religious scholars agree that the Canaanites were one of the most sexual and perverted cultures the world has ever known. Think about this, can you imagine a few perverted pagans getting together to create this unique race, religion and language consisting of millions? Things like the circumcision, the ten commandments suddenly appearing from these pagan cults seem bewildering. You also seem to be confused, I recommend this scholar's analysis and explanation of the personal name of God and the title of God.

>where did God come from (no I do not accept bullshit about Yaweh being a necessary being)

This is just bad metaphysics. Why should I trust someone who has such childish, inane axioms to make an unbiased, serious considerations of complex ontological inquiries instead of an emotional, doxastically perverse inference onset from adolescent musings? If you're just going to stomp your feet and refuse to accept such a basic axiom then why should I bother continuing this discussion, especially when you continue your condescending, insulting charade, when I've asked you to refrain from doing so;

>>The more you talk, the less virtuous Yaweh sounds. Keep going...maybe we can turn a few Christian readers into deists.

-
>> You are way down your rabbit hole.

>why does God not speak simply and clearly in a manner that everyone can understand, as he did when he spoke to Moses and Noah (the free will rebuttal to this makes no sense)

Where are you confused on this? Keep in mind that the Bible was designed to serve as reading material. Believers would pour their intellect over the Scriptures to deduce a history and ontology of God's interaction with the world, His complex doctrines, etc. What we see in the Bible is different to what we find in other religions where people will decide that a certain doctrine is God's commandment under the guise of prophethood. God specifically instructed prophets to do certain things that mesh together to make the culmination of the Bible today.

>why did God not directly write a simple and clear book of instructions instead of a meandering, confusing, self-contradictory mess which looks even less coherent than the Koran of the Book of Mormon to an objective reader?

This ties in with my previous answer. A deity who just visits someone, gives them an index of correct doctrines and commandments is hardly convincing at all. Then compare the God of the Bible who, over a 1500 year period raises up prophets from a group of people to announce in prophecy the coming of the Messiah. The latter is more coherent.

>why did God create cancer, tornados, AIDS, hurricanes? (As is typical you answered ""why not"" rather than why)

It's your obligation to prove to me that God wouldn't do so. I explained that it would be a forceful objection if the Bible explicitly told us that this creation is the final creation and we exist purely as pets. But this isn't the case. This objection also assumes that the purpose of existence, let alone temporal existence is happiness instead of the knowledge of God. Anyway, we're simply not in any position to ponder whether God has sufficient moral reasons to allow disasters and what not occur. 

>why does God need ""pets?""

He doesn't. Neither I nor the Bible claims this.

>why would morality consist of a pet obeying its master?

If God is the grounding of morality, then worshiping/serving this God is the greatest moral action that can be executed. Simple.

>why does the Bible contradict both science and archeology?

It doesn't? I think this, as well as this and this give a good introduction to the topic. 

>why does the Bible contradict common sense? ""How do you know that Harry Potter is fiction?

This is a terrible dichotomy. We can infer that Harry Potter is fiction because we're reminded of the author, the intent of the novels, the publishing company, etc. 

>God sending bears to maul children to Jesus cursing fig trees.

The first is an example of divine justice, seen in the OT all the time. The second is a parable concerning the relationship between Jews and gentiles, as explained here.

>There is no convincing evidence that the Bible was inspired. Quite the opposite. It's first chapter reads exactly like the creation myth of the Haida or any other pre-scientific society.

These are just claims, aside from that the first chapter is a poetic story chronicling God's passion in creating the world.

>You are starting from your conclusion. ""God is omniscient, so whenever he asks where are you he must be speaking rhetorically."" This is incredibly intellectually dishonest. I approach it the opposite way. ""There is a being. The being asks where other beings are. Therefore the being does not have omniscience."" That's the objective third party reading of the text.

The heavy use of parables used by God makes it absolutely obvious that this was a rhetorical device. As i noted earlier, Jesus speaks almost exclusively in parables to his crowds and in other places. It's absolutely ad hoc to suggest that God didn't know where Adam was, as I noted he had just sinned and God was rhetorically reminding him that he had dissolved his fellowship with God. 

>If I read the phone book with the idea that it is the word of god, I can find any message in there that I want. That's what you are doing; imposing your theology on the text to avoid grappling with the clear and true meaning of the writers. Just as it would be a waste of time for me to try to convince a paranoiac that there is no message in the phone book...

This is just insane, are you really suggesting that throughout the entire Bible, there's not a single recurrent theme, or anything even remotely similar? Are you even aware of Biblical exegesis? 

>I can imagine a greater being: one that does not invent and then unleash smallpox.

As I already noted, this is just arrogant for a finite being to make a claim like this. How do you know that there isn't a sufficient moral reason for this occurring?

>What are you talking about. I could murder someone right now. But I have no inclination to do it. What kind of twisted definition of free will are you using whereby the fact that some people have voices in their head telling them to kill, or over-active violence modules in their brain gives those people MORE free will than me?

How on earth did you arrive at this from my claims? There's no reason for any contingent being to exist if it's just acting like a robot, and if a being is going to be free, this requires that it has the ability to exercise this free will. 

>According to your bizarre theory, the fact that I am not attracted to the opposite sex constitutes a lack of free will, but the temptation of the homosexual constitutes a presence of it. This is exactly the opposite of any logical or common sense position. The presence of faulty (from a Christian sin perspective) brain modules represents an INFRINGEMENT of free will. My non-violent nature allows me to have greater free will than people that I know who are the opposite.

This sounds lot like the Bible's claim that people are born with sinful natures. Whether these be sexual or homicidal is a coincidental question. I have no understanding of how you inferred that this means that a homosexual has more free will than heterosexuals.

 >I am not attracted to having sex with children. You are saying that my lack of temptation is ""not going to work out well in the long term"" because I ""won't learn that these activities are bad and repent?""

Pretty much. It's necessary for people to learn what sin is and it's consequences. 

>Every toddler (except Noah's family), puppy dog (except 2), koala (except 2) was part of a ""rebellious generation""? All of them deserved to be drowned?

What did I just say regarding sin? It's bad and requires judgement.

Except upper management seemed quite at ease when my direct manager said ""no"" to monitoring. We have no formal ticketing system, no real time monitoring of network or servers and basically no endpoint visibility either. I was told to decommission Dell's free monitoring solution (Openmanage Essentials) which rendered us effectively without any way of finding out if our servers were having hardware issues. These kind of 'interesting' management choices never arise in isolation but as a wider attitude towards system maintenance. So while I agree with your idea the practical implications were impossible.

"> conflict of interest

Of course there's a conflict of interest. The question is: ""Does it matter""?

If there is a contractual term being violated, then yes. But if that was the case, Bluehole would have mentioned it and would already be pursuing legal action. Knowing a bit about engine licensing agreements, I also really doubt that there is.

So in the absence of that contractual obligation, what kind of conflict of interest should be prohibited? The position you're promoting seems to suggest that engine manufactures should be prohibited from closely competing in the same space as their customers. 

That's frankly absurd, and would cripple any major engine maker. That's why people are annoyed here, which you seem to be missing for all your condescending ""sigh""ing. People do understand what you're saying is a core part of this dispute. But if that reasoning was taken to its logical (and legal...) conclusion, the industry would be seriously harmed. Basically none of epics previous games could have been produced. Every single unreal game had very close competition, much of it on the same engine. Of course there was a conflict of interest there! Suggesting that should be disallowed is naturally going to get people annoyed. 

It's also worth noting that you offer the extreme similarity as a defense of bluehole. That's also why people are annoyed at you and them. Similarity without actually copying assets is 100% legal and really quite common in the gaming industry. 

Suggesting that a company should ever, barring contractual prohibition, be prevented from copying gameplay itself is precisely why this whole dispute rubs people the wrong way."

They don't. There is no such a thing a s a ""philosophical proof"". Proofs exist in consistent and non-ambiguous systems (which is pretty much a definition of mathematics). Philosophy does not operate with such systems, it's not nearly its goal.

It wasn't an obstacle in the first place. I dislike Trump and the entire Republican establishment. The fact that a mod who even voted for Trump (and proclaims not voting for corp.

Since you successfully refuted the claim ""things we can think about must exit"", but his actual assertion was ""things we can think about must [from a subjective standpoint] exist"", you refuted an argument composed of a subset of the words in his argument. That is, you didn't refute his argument at all! 

I figured that ""you refuted a subset of his argument"" would be clear enough that you would interpret it in that manner; clearly I was wrong.

This is also why I said that such refutations are easy. Providing a counterexample to an argument is trivial if you can remove arbitrary words from it.

For instance, I might take your statement here:

>Thus, I maintain my position that I have in no way ""given a counterexample for a subset of his claim without saying anything about the rest"". I gave examples of objects which are thought about, but have no existence...

And by removing a few words, turn it into this:

>objects which are thought about ... have ... existence

And then provide counterexamples by citing you again. Would you say that I've proven you wrong? I think not. Rather, I've taken a subset of the words in your argument, formed them into a new argument, and refuted that argument, which is exactly what you did to /u/drownedatbirth, though clearly less dramatically.

>Is that because you realized you were wrong or you got hung up in my one assumption and forgot about it?

You're rude and condescending, both to me and to /u/drownedatbirth. You've been that way throughout this discussion. 

I'm not going to get into the tangle of formally proving that you meet some particular definition of rudeness, though I'm sure you'd love me to, but I can tell you that people like you are the very reason that ""laymen"" (in relation to philosophy) think that philosophy is nonsense.

"> The article ignores that most psychologists do not consider IQ to be dogma or a measure of one's ""self-worth.""

The article specifically acknowledges that even Binet himself ""wasn't actually trying to measure intelligence"" and that he ""knew his test was flawed, that both ‘intelligence’ and ‘retardation’ were subjective concepts"". What it criticises seems to me to rather be those (psychologists or not) who do appear to consider IQ/intelligence a measure of an individual's worth. (Think redditors' love of eugenics.)

 The ""joke"" is entirely police based, so again, it's not entirely appropriated. Consider when she would even use the voice line... Most characters are designed to speak after a kill if in combat... Even if she was a cop, where's the moral logic in delivering that line post kill in such a game as OW? Asides from offending the real world police force, she'd be mocking herself.

>>This thread was mostly made as a joke, but if I wanted to actually defend the idea, I'd say that Overwatch is clearly meant to represent all kinds of human beings living in harmony and overcoming adversity together ...... So would it be completely out of place for the game to shit on racism with a voiceline like this? I don't think so.

You're right, the premise of OW is the pursuit of harmony... Your support of a polarizing joke based on police brutality is the entire antithesis to the concept of harmony, that's really not debatable. In fact the word ""polarizing"" itself is the literal opposite in meaning.

Overall I can see you're trying to take the moral high ground or something but in reality you're condescending ironic, and by far hypocritical with your counter logic. The clamor for this voice line makes me cringe, it's not funny, and it doesn't make sense to include it in this game.

Overextended is/was a non-rotating format. So yeah, there's plenty of reason to think it wouldn't suck ""from the first time it rotated"", since an Overextended rotation would never occur.


Continuing to delve through your colossal waste of words, we arrive at:

Again, Overextended is a nonrotating format. That you keep emphasizing otherwise shows how little you know of the subject you're writing about. Overextended was basically Modern, but starting at Invasion instead of 8th Edition. Gavin Verhey made a compelling case for that starting point. (As an aside, I happen to disagree with Verhey and think that Mercadian Masques is the ideal line of demarcation, since that's the first set that's not governed by the reserve list.

Your whole thing about feminism just makes me think that you don't know anything about feminism at all. Many feminist thinkers (Simone de Beauvoir for example) think that the patriarchy is also a disservice to the man. Many feminist thinkers are very upfront with their ideology, but, again, it is most coherently placed in its strongest thinkers. The larger a group gets, the more the ideologies become diverse (see Christianity, republicans + democrats, etc.) 

I just disagree about the piano dropping thing. If anything, it seems reversed. In my school, women were expected to have sex because they were women, and were often forced to do so. Women were sexually harassed constantly, because the guys thought they were owed it. In my religion, women were expected to never make decisions of their own, and were expected to be fully subservient to the man (this entails a lot). These instances occurred recently in a moderately well-off area in a western country. We are far from done on women's issues. Plus, these issues are greatly amplified in places like Liberia where male on female rape is expected and is considered the norm. 

Now I'm not saying that men never experience oppression, it's just in my experience it has been about 1/100th of what women have experienced just for being women."

They tend to refer to him as weaker in regards to his MORTALITY, which was revealed to be caused by proximity to Chloe.

That is NOT linked to his wings in any way.

NOTHING is truly ""explained"", and only a handful of events exist that allow us to make educated guesses about what actually is going on (which is all they are until something is confirmed as canon in the show).

You really strike me as a very belligerent sort of person. If you aren't capable of having an actual debate without condescending to everyone (despite the fact that you have no ground to stand on, as your ""facts"" are flawed, and demonstrate a lack of understanding of common elements in storytelling) then really, just be quiet. You're embarrassing yourself.

Just trying to help fellow redditors out. 

Why would you be arguing here so vehemently? You're been rude and condescending as well, which suggests that you have something to gain from this and don't like me spoiling your fun.

The irony in this statement is hilarious. You've ignored every fact that I've pointed out because it doesn't fit your narrative, and you refuse to acknowledge any flaws that I point out in your argument, yet here you are acting like you have some sort of high ground here.

You've used one single source - one that is hardly representative of the entire country - and you claim to be the one stating facts. Yet the majority of the time, all you've done is make blanket statements that are unsourced and unfounded.

Putting things in bold or italics doesn't make you any more right. Neither does bringing a snarky, condescending attitude. I'm done here."

>I am not releasing a study claiming to show conclusively what is happening. My bias has no effect on any study I release, because I have not released any.

Show me the claim of ""conclusively"", because the study in great detail lists its methods and the possible caveats.

You however, are propagandising on reddit on a daily basis, lying, and repeatedly using statements and sources that have been repeatedly discredited, yet you do not seem to care. 

But you didn't create those sources so your hands are clean eh? But when others use sources that you don't approve of (without actually discrediting them), then gosh darn KiA is full of mysiginist Islamophobe alt right conspiritards!

The lack of proper study in your posting on reddit is apparent.

>All her study comes down to is: she looked at English language media, found cases she considers honour killings, somehow derived the religion of the perpetrators of the crime, and came to the conclusion about who more prominently commits those crimes.

If you take out your subjective ""considers"" and ""somehows"", it's almost like she actually did her goddamn homework instead of being a lying propagandist like yourself.

If you actually read the study you would see that she categorised the motives for honor killings included in this study.

And stop dodging my question: Do you have a single study with better sources and more in-depth research?

>I did not say they are not. 

Your conduct and condescending attitude towards people criticising Islam, Muslims and Islamic culture and countries on perfectly reasonable basis shows otherwise. I might suggest that you are in fact a Muslim supremacist.

>But would you take a study by Jonathan Mcintosh for example to be reliable without looking at his background?

I would take it to be reliable based on the reliability of the study itself. Which is why, for example, I do not care much about Anita's ""I don't play videogames"" statement with anything other than that conflicting with her statements about being a lifetime gamer. The research and conclusions she puts out there in her videos are lacking enough without that.

People are allowed to be motivated in their work to want to persuade others, that's not an issue. The methods and untruthfelness are the problem. Then again, reality does not support the arguments made by McIntosh, Sarkeesian, and you.

>What a stupid question. And that is leaving aisde the fact that I highly doubt the 91% number due to the ""study"" not being fully released with all accompanying sources.

A stupid question for a stupid statement. 

The great thing about reality is that it does not need your belief or anyone's to exist. Feel free to offer you counter-evidence though, still waiting on that.

Wether its in the Quran or any Hadith or not, current Muslim culture has a way to large support for honor killings across the world, and Muslims are the vast majority of offenders and victims of this practice. 

The old testament says to stone your children to death (alongside your family and townsmen) if they are rebellious and to not allow men in church who have lost their penises. Funny how the vast majority of rebellious children in the west remain unstoned, and we don't have mandatory penis checks for adults on the steps.

Guess what, your religion mandates some pretty terrible goddamn things and a disturbing amount of its followers act on it.

you present something that has virtually no degree of uncertainty, and someone from outside your field says, ""uncertainty is a thing, they cant say it's accurate.""

how would you respond?

> I'm sorry that it's not what you want to hear or confusing or whatever, but that's how it is.

no need to apologise, the only thing that's confusing is you assuming that mentioning uncertainty exists somehow translates to these results being uncertain with no evidence nor qualified experience in the field nor expertise with the testing equipment.

The fact is that Chomsky and Sanders do not share a political philosophy, and ""making positive sounds"" is not the same as suggesting they are philosophical fellow-travellers. They are not ""at the same end of several political spectra"", either, unless you think the only distinction that is important in political philosophy is the left/right one.

">is classic hyperbole.

Okay. 

Why did they create Nullifiers? Because people were spamming powers to farm in Excavations. The groups had a Greedy Pull Mag, a Nekros, a Pilfering Hydroid, and an EV Trinity. These groups would spam powers and collect loot without having to move. Nullifiers were created to halt this. Greedy Pull was nerfed to halt this. 

People used to farm Syndicate rep using a Corpus interception tileset and Mags because it was expedient. They nerfed Mag such that she had to be ""aware"" of something in order to damage it with her powers.

When the Excalibur rework was announced DE made it clear that Exalted Blade would work with Syndicate sword augments. Then they changed their minds. This was either right after or near the same time as the radial javelin tweak that made Excalibur have to be ""aware"" of an enemy to damage it with that ability. 

These and other changes were the direct and immediate result of DE being displeased with how effectively people were farming content. There were no glitches or bugs being exploited, it was a simple matter of using what was available to the utmost. DE didn't like it and proceed to chop the fucking legs out from under several frames. 

How is what I said ""classic hyperbole"" when it is a matter of history frames and their abilities were changed because people were farming and acquiring syndicate rep too effectively?

>But to argue that all DE has done is ""fuck you over"" is patently absurd.

When you told him this news, it was right after he had vented about his own situation at work. Your intentions were good but this was a mistake. Doing this juxtaposed your career success with the fact that his career is stalling. Make sure his own insecurities are not weighing on his on mind when you tell him. Yes, he should be able to put those aside and be happy for you, but he failed to do that, because people don't always do what they should. Make things easier for him by celebrating when you are both in the mood to celebrate.

If he does become sulky about his own prospects, resort to outright flattery. Remind him that: 

> there's plenty of work for him in all places I could possibly move to, since he's an engineer specializing in a highly-desired and little-filled specialty. . . .He's got an exam for a certification coming up at the end of October that will make him much more hireable.

Spin your moving as an opportunity to get a new job and get out from under that boss that didn't promote him.

I'll take your word for it that this how his mother and you are accustomed to referring to him and that he isn't emasculated by it, but we aren't his mother and we don't know the context. Your audience had every reason to conclude that your use of ""boy"" was consistent with the typical usage and connotations of the word, i.e. an adolescent male, which, when applied to a grown man, is condescending and belittling. The lack of clarity and context was your short-coming, not ours.

This is another conversation for another time, but if his lack of motivation and petty grudge against his current boss are holding him back, maybe some tough love is an order.

"> Consider changing how you play the game before blaming how it was made.

That seems highly condescending for an answer that is supposed to be given ""respectfully"". 

No matter how you want to glorify it, putting nice words around it, most sidequests in this game are bare fetchquests bringing nothing new to the narrative or to the world.

I've been addicted to MMOs and did countless hours of fetch quests without any complaint, so I don't think that ""how I'm playing"" is to blame in this. The reality of it is that in FFXV, these fetch quests are given without any purpose, any character development or help to the scenario. 

If you think that doing 3 times in a row the same dungeon without any story or description behind each quest, and because you can't take several quests at once ""never seem monotonous"" then you probably are giving a free pass to FFXV due to either a blind positivity or a small dedicated playtime. 

However in both cases, it isn't something that should be expected of anyone, and it doesn't change the actual content of the game, so before blaming someone's ""way of playing"" in comparison to your own, you should look objectively at the content provided in the game."
"I didn't realize you were a Sun Tzu buff or I would have just referenced those things rather than trying to explain them as briefly as I could. I thought I was giving some quick examples to a layperson about times where Sun Tzu might not have been a totally stand-up dude, or perhaps worse.

I left the part out about the king asking him to do it because it seemed irrelevant to my point. Sun Tzu still (at least in the questionably true account) claimed he could turn the king's harem into a company of soldiers (even if he was asked to do it first).

I also left the part out about how he cautioned against death ground because it seemed irrelevant. He still recognized the advantages of having men in a do or die situation and that there were instances when it might be preferable. You are arguing to what extent he meant it. I am arguing that he meant it at least some of the time. If he meant it ever, and if he wrote it down I assume he did, I would say that is a pretty dick move. Also, I don't think I indicated that he advocated throwing men into mass suicide.

Again, I'm not arguing that the world would be better off without him, that he didn't do plenty of good things, etc. I'm arguing that most people, even in that time, did not order men to what they knew could possibly be their deaths. You might argue that that's what generals do, which is why I'd argue that most any effective general easily falls into the category I described farther up.

">The existing raids are never updated to give current drops, it would make it too easy to farm all the new gear. Even if they were to raise the mob levels to be on par with the new cap, it would give the player 4x's the chance to get the raid gear and they would end up being capped out in a matter of 2 or 3 weeks.

I find it interesting that players are completely fine with Tower Vendor's circumventing the Raid process when it benefits them. However, when it is the case that someone could run 4 Raids in a week and get to the level cap faster than someone else (by putting in a legitimate amount of work) they aren't okay with it. How can people NOT see the hypocrisy in that.

"First of all, I disagree with you about those fields being STEM. Most of them aren't, the exceptions being physiology, chemistry, and biomedical engineering. Some of them may be tangentially related to STEM, but I assure you that no one considers a graduate of ""environmental studies"" to be any sort of credible scientist, technician, engineer, or mathematician.

Second, I agree with you that the headline and the contents of the article don't match. The title says STEM, but the article is clearly being specific about engineering. So when you say that ""There [sic] entire fucking point of the article is about 'why so few women graduate college with a STEM degree'."", I disagree. The article is clearly written to be about engineering. The study was done by engineering professors, studying engineering students, made recommendations for ways to improve (in their eyes) engineering departments and curricula, and was published in a journal named ""Engineering Studies"" (which I strongly suspect, having never looked into it in the slightest, to be a journal of complete garbage). For you to claim the article is about the entirety of STEM instead of just engineering is plain dishonest.


>The research paper is uninteresting and pointless, but the linked article is deliberately misinforming people.

I haven't read the research paper, so I can't comment on the details of it. I have no interest in paying for what I expect will be a sub-par paper. Even granted that longitudinal studies tend to have fewer participants, 34 seems disconcertingly low. And you're right, the abstract is being dishonest about the number of students that left engineering. The linked article, however, is basically just parroting the research paper abstract. Don't believe me? Do a quick ctrl-F for ""social justice"" on the page of the article. I got two matches, one in the title and a link to a different article on a side bar. Look at the list of majors that the students switched into again. Almost all of them involve much more human contact than engineering does, which is one of the points that the article makes. Again, the problem with the article here is writing a headline that doesn't quite match up with the contents of the article in order to get clicks.


Is it a study with a strangely low sample size? Yes. Is the headline misleading from the actual content of the article? Yes. But what about this makes you think that people should be ""ashamed for eating up bullshit propaganda""? Do you dispute the conclusions, that women on average tend to favor careers with more personal contact and social interactions than men do?

>Let's not pretend you people aren't eating up a study that says there needs to be even more ultra-progressive identity politics quotas for women in engineering...


The linked article has explicit quotes from two studies, the 2014 Purdue study urging that engineering departments should ""infuse a feminist care of ethics"" into their courses, and the more recent Colorado school of Mines study demanding that ""engineering should include concern for people, communities, and societal welfare at the heart of the profession"". Those statements directly indicate injecting identity politics into fields where it has no business being.

Also, you're being very condescending. As someone who spent a number of years going through different income brackets, I have a very good idea what it's like to earn minimum wage or just above and try and support a small family. I also have an idea of what it's like to be in a job that pays around $120k a year and the stress and commitment that comes with that. While I was doing more manual labor at minimum wage, the stress, effort, and expectations are far worse at my current gig. 

> $1000/month for food? There are (presumably) 3 of you, and one of you is a small child (because otherwise the $2000/month you pay for childcare would be a complete waste). When my family had foreign exchange students living in the house there were a total of 6 of us, all pretty much fully grown. My parents paid $600/month on food for the 6 of us, and it's not like we didn't eat well. We went out to eat usually once every other week and everything.

I'm not sure where you're from, but at least in my area, to get the suggested servings of fruit, vegetables, dairy, and protein per meal we spend about $210 a week on food with some small allowances for snacks and all for a family of 4, and we don't eat out often.

> $4000/vacation. WASTE OF MONEY. My sister and her husband went to san fransisco and stayed in a beautiful home for an entire week and only spent $1200 total. Most of that was for airfare. They considered this splurging.

I'll agree here, but again the point of the post was to point out poor financial planning so here would be a huge savings per year.

> $400/month on gas? What the fuck? I commute an hour to work and an hour back 5 days a week, sometimes 6, and have a $150/month gas budget. That is straight up nonsense. Either that brand new car you are paying for is a fucking gas guzzler, in which case you are an idiot for wasting all that money, or that's a straight up lie.

Last year, we could come close to hitting that. This provides no context on the area they live in. Gas was at about $2.75 a gallon most of the year here. Both our parents live over an hour away, and between my wife's commute, mine, sitting in traffic, errands, and weekend trips to visit our parents with the kids we're at about $330 a month in gas.

> $250/month on clothes!?!?!??!!?!?!?!? WHAT THE FUCK!?!? I don't even spend $250/year on clothes.

For my job, I wear a suit to work everyday. To keep dry cleaning expenses down, it's better for me to have 4-5 suits, and a couple lighter weight ones for summer. This requires occasional tailoring which isn't cheap. Along with that add in ties, dresshirts, business appropriate winter coat, business casual for work trips. I don't splurge on this stuff often, but shirts do need replacing over the year and eventually my dress clothes start looking not so dressy. With that, I also need clothes to wear around the house which are updated far less often, but still needs to happen. Now my wife needs the same, plus two kids that are constantly growing in an area that gets 4 full seasons, so they need multiple coats per year that are temperature appropriate, snow pants, boots, shoes, jeans, shorts, short and long sleeve shirts, sweaters, and so on. Kid's clothes are really expensive, and we do buy some second hand. $3k a year on clothes isn't unreasonable depending the location and job requirements.

> $400/month on Children's Lessons? How many things are they learning!? I took Guitar and Piano lessons when I was in high school and only paid $120/month total. All you have to do is research good places that are cheap, and they are everywhere.

This is also something that can be totally cut out, but then again I'm more focused on making sure my kids get good opportunities. Without a line item breakdown of what specifically they mean from lessons, here's what my costs are in general for my kids to do activities:

 Music lessons for 2 per month = $240

 Sports (usually paid per quarter, my kids do T-ball in the sprint/summer, soccer in the fall, and swimming in the winter) = $260"

I can't believe that I have to explain to you that this is a common way for someone to refer to themselves in a generalized, third-person perspective, particularly when referring to someone else's behavior. IE you correct someone's English in a patronizing, pretentious manner, and they reply, ""It's not polite to correct others in that manner."" See? Make sense now?

"> The arena-shooter fans already dislike how the game plays, and I really don't see there being enough unlockable content and ""progression"" to keep all of the modern-shooter fans playing for too long

okay i don't get either of these, and it seems like a lot of people actually believe this, so i am going to dispute it.

i am an arena shooter fan. it is the only kind of FPS i enjoy playing, honestly, because i hate games where the TTK is so ridiculously low that there is no chance for actual gunplay and it is all about ambushing because whoever sees the other one first wins (""realistic"" military shooters for example). and i loved the beta - i absolutely adored it. i haven't had so much fun in a multiplayer FPS since like fucking goldeneye/timesplitters/quake/etc with my brothers as a kid. 

i have some criticisms as well (i wish there was SOME way to not glory kill players and just melee them for example, or that the animation had some invincibility to it if it is forced), but all in all, i am MORE excited for the game now than i was before, and i was not even expecting to really like the multiplayer.

as for the second point, what exactly makes you think that unlocks and progression are really what keep people playing modern FPS over and over? honestly that is condescending as fuck to assume that players don't enjoy the game because they like playing the game. some people do actually like games like CoD or Halo, and there's nothing wrong with that.

if people like playing Doom, they will keep playing it, regardless of XP or unlocks or anything like that which is nothing but something entertaining going on in the background between matches. even a game like Destiny, which is entirely designed around addictive loops and FOMO to keep players engaged, retains players that enjoy the core gameplay long after they have finished ""the grind"". 

> I think there's going to be a pretty niche crowd that chooses to invest a lot of time into the multiplayer.

so if my mom's 51-year old boyfriend who has never played a Doom game before but loves Destiny and Battlefront, my older brother who hasn't played Doom since the first game was released (and is a R6: Siege fanatic), and my best friend who plays nothing but CS:GO all day long are all agreeing when i talk to them about how good the beta is, i don't think that qualifies as ""niche"". i think it is hitting the right spot for a lot of players, even if it doesn't fit comfortably into the ""old"" arena shooter or ""new"" military shooter models."

">So potential and kinetic energy aren't really energy? Please read up on this topic.

They are values representing the energy of an object, either at rest or at motion. They are not the actual energy. They are our observation of the energy of mass, for example, as opposed to something like light which is the energy itself.

>But this is a classroom -- it must be, because you don't understand the topic. You think the energy of motion isn't ""real"" energy.

You can't get much more condescending than this. Not to get personal, but I can only imagine how hard it must have been to work with you at NASA.

>With me so far?

Yeah, I've been with you the whole time. But an object undergoing rotation is being accelerated. Nothing you have said changes that fact and there is nothing that you can say to change it.

>If you have an weight rotating on the end of a string, and you cut the string, the weight's motion changes from rotational to linear with no change in energy.

We aren't talking about energy. We are talking about rotation and acceleration. Once you cut the string there is no longer rotation (which you seemed to contradict in your other post...). While the string is attached the string is applying an equal and opposite force to the object and the object is being accelerated towards the center of rotation.

>If you have a weight moving in a linear path, and you hook it with a string, the weight's motion changes from linear to rotational with no change in energy.

We aren't talking about energy. We are talking about acceleration. The object would undergo acceleration once it was captured and began to rotate. It's velocity would be constantly changing even if the magnitude of that velocity was not. That's what acceleration is: change in velocity.

>An object that is rotating continues to do so because of inertia (Newton's First Law), with no change in energy and no accelerations.

No. It does not. An object that is rotating has a force applied to it. In the example you gave it is the force of the string keeping it from moving along a linear path instead of gravity as in the case of a satellite orbiting an object. Once that force is removed it re-/assumes linear motion...

>With respect to potential and kinetic energy, the two cases are equivalent.

Hopefully one last time. We are not talking about potential and kinetic energy. We are talking about acceleration."

>Vekselberg uses the cover of Columbus Nova being an ""American company"" to get around pesky regulations, and particularly, the current sanctions against Renova. 

Current sanctions against renova took effect after the payment to cohen, so it follows that the company paid Cohen under its current name, while under zero sanctions, so it didn't have to have its current name in order to evade sanctions. Since you're smart enough to be condescending maybe you're smart enough to figure that one out.

From the article you linked -
>It is a company technically owned by others but which looks after money owned and controlled in large part—if not entirely—by Vekselberg and his family.

Nice try, ""in large part"" and ""if not entirely"" are weasel phrases.

The previous commenter linked to a study regarding Naturally Occuring Lithium being studied in drinking water supplies as proof of anti-depressants being considered for use in drinking water. 

The processed lithium of which you speak are Lithium Salts, (generally in the form of Lithium Citrate and Lithium Carbonate, among others) which are used as mood stabilizing drug for depression, bipolar disorder and many other conditions. No where in the linked article were these medications discussed nor was that the substance I was referring to. If you have any proof of Lithium Citrate or similar Lithium Salts being considered for drinking water I would be interested, as I would obviously be opposed to that usage.

">As I said: I dont bring cash with me. I figure that if Im serious about this, I should plan how I intend to help. 

And likewise, I said I deliberately keep cash on me because that is part of how I plan to help. In terms of serious aid, I donate to charities. In terms of meeting peoples' immediate requests, I give money as asked.

>And I've decided that the most reasonable and economical use of the resources I have available is to create care packs with food and dental goods (because who on the streets wants to spend $8 on dental care) and space blankets (because the weather is an actual threat).

It would be even more reasonable and economical to donate that same money to charity groups that directly help and advocate for the homeless. If your intent is maximizing good with your money, then handing it out piecemeal is inefficient no matter how you go about it. That's why I donate, but also give cash in order to give a bit of compassion and freedom to the homeless. 

>At the end of the day, as a Christian, I think I will be accountable for how I live my life and how I used my resources. I think that means I should think about this carefully, determine what I have available to help the poor, and determine the best way to allocate that. 

And at the end of the day, as an atheist, I hold myself accountable for how I live my life and how I use my resources. That means I should think about this carefully, determine what I have available to help the poor, and determine the best way to allocate that. 

Just because you're a Christian does not mean you're the only one to care about doing the most you can to help the poor. 

>I dont know that you or the homeless guy is really in a position to judge my finances or how much excess wealth I have.

I am not now, nor have I ever criticized you for how much you give, but rather for how you choose to give it. The way you have described giving is in a very patronizing manner and with strings attached. You also seem highly sensitive to criticism on it, and seem to expect that people automatically be grateful to you for handing them something they didn't ask for.

>I could share for instance that I am in the middle of renovating a house that is in extremely poor condition (black mold, bad gutters), and that Im not exactly rolling in dough. 

I'm sorry, but I'm deeply in student debt, making minimum wage, and sharing an apartment with 5 people. I can barely afford to keep my 20 year old car running and insured, much less afford a mortgage. The idea of affording a house is laughable, so this rings rather hollow to me.

>Giving $10 to homeless people in lieu of food would mean that 2-3 people a month are getting handouts. Instead, I can budget for 30 or more care packs with that same money.

Again, if maximizing your efficiency is what you want, then just donate the money instead. If your desire is doing something kind for the homeless people you meet day-to-day, then just giving them what they ask for is the best way to help. 

>So if they find that patronizing, Im sorry. But since its my money, Im ultimately the one whos gotta make the calls on how its used.

So, you're just admitting that you don't really care about their wants and needs, but rather what you think they should want and need? Do you not hear how incredibly condescending you're sounding? This is literally money you are choosing to share from your excess, and you're getting offended that people in absolute dire poverty don't appreciate you for giving them something they never asked for.

>You really arent in a position to judge the state of my finances, nor am I prepared to share an accounting sheet with the amount I contribute to charity with you. 

At what point did I discuss amounts? I said to give to the homeless. How much you give is highly dependent on numerous factors, and I wouldn't presume to judge. My point was that you don't get brownie points merely for giving to them, because it is a societal and moral obligation to do so. You seem to think you deserve gratitude for offering food when money is begged of you, and that isn't the case.

>I also dont think you're in a position to make that kind of absolute moral statement, because every situation is different and many shelters recommend that you not give money to the homeless.

I happen to agree with his holiness and many advocacy groups that giving money when asked is fine, but that it is not an efficient way to help and should never be the only way you give to the homeless. In general, if a shelter tells someone not to give money to the homeless, it's because people are too likely to neglect donating in other, more beneficial ways as a result.

>You misunderstand if you think thats what Im doing. Im recognizing that free money handouts creates the worst kinds of incentives for folks who might be so inclined, whereas food handouts have substantially less negative incentive attached to them.

But giving food handouts is literally the same as giving a money handout, merely with one step removed. If you buy food for me, then that is $5 you have effectively saved me from having to spend. If I were the sort of (highly rare) unscrupulous individual to take advantage of charity, then I would happily accept people's offers to buy me food in place of cash, since then I wouldn't have to spend the money myself. 

Can you see what I'm getting at? It's an incredibly inefficient way to spot scammers, and it's patronizing to people who just asked you for cash. You're literally telling them you don't see them as an equal and don't trust them to spend money for themselves. It's no wonder people snap at you for offering.

>Im well aware of that problem, and of the problem of hostile architecture (benches with spikes so they cant sleep). And I think I could word that better but it seriously stinks to spend a significant amount of time and money on this problem and then have people get indignant that the time and effort I put in wasnt what they wanted.

And maybe you should focus on putting the time and effort into giving them what they actually want, instead of assuming you know better? After all, if I ask someone to get me cash for my birthday, and they choose to put a ton of time and effort into making me a gift basket that I have no use for, they shouldn't be surprised if I'm less than enthused with them for ignoring my specific request. 

>I have no intention to go into the sum total of charity I offer; I dont do it so I can boast, or others can recognize me, or because I think I have to do it to be a good person. I do it because I care about the people, and want to help them, and that means that if you reject what Im offering my only feeling is (on a good day) that Im sorry I couldnt help you.

I have not once criticized the amount you give, but merely how you choose to give it. If you care and want to help, give people what they actually ask you for, otherwise don't be surprised when they're offended at your condescending ""charity"".

>But it is my personal belief that handing out money has way more downside than up in most situations, so I simply dont do it. I dont think it helps (most of the time), I think its liable to create problems for me, the recipient, or society, and that there are way more effective ways to use that money.

Exactly. You're paternalisticly assuming you know better how to spend this money than the people asking for it. That's why they get angry with you when they ask for money and you offer food. You aren't giving them what they want, you're giving them what you think they should want, and its rather arrogant of you to expect to be thanked for it.

You said you Europeans determine sexual compatibility before marriage. That's one aspect of marital compatibility (but not the only one, nor the most important).

Far from being the prerequisite to a fulfilling marriage that you appear to think it is, sexual compatibility is the natural result of the union of two people who each rank the other's welfare as a higher priority than their own.

> they duel for about five seconds then kanan just grabs his hand and throws him off the temple like he's some useless stormtrooper.

He catches Maul off of his balance and makes him fall of the ledge. I don't see how this makes him a ""useless stormtrooper"". It was a surprise attack, it's not like Maul could fly. Kanan didn't beat Maul because of his superior ability, he outsmarted him. Like I said, Maul is cocky and impulsive. He underestimated Kanan. What don't you get about that?

> The fact ahsoka left kanan alone with maul shows they were trying to make out kana an maul are at least roughly equals.

Ahsoka had to rush to save Ezra from Vader. Kanan even said to ""go get Ezra"". Implying that saving Ezra is more important than saving himself. Which Ahsoka agreed with.


> Yeah i am hense why i said she saved kana and zeb from them. Again if she could have taken them out then she would have it makes no sense for her to drag the fight on in the situation and it just plain stupid. given they were in an empire controlled city.

There's a difference between ""dragging on a fight"" and ""not going all out"". Ahsoka was not going all out against the Inquisitors. Yet she still stomped them. She was going all out against Vader and held him off.

Please drop your holier-than-thou attitude. It's annoying and doesn't contribute to the discussion.

> the fact it's simple maths and your finding an average is irrelevant as there is no way the animator measure it at all they'll just have it move across the screen at whatever looks best depending on how far the bolt is travelling ,the angle its moving in relation to the ""camera""and how far away the bolt is in relation to the ""camera"". they aren't going to try and keep them at any sort of consistent speed as long as it looks okay. Just because we have no official answer on how fast blaster bolts are compared to bullets in sw doesn't mean we should jump to some completely unreliable method. 

I understand how animation works. Yet I've done frame-calcs and rarely do I find that the variances between the speeds of the projectile within a series are large. It's usually consistent with the exception of a few outliers. Of course, it depends on the series but for Clone Wars and Rebels, it's relatively consistent. If there are variances, they are usually negligible. 

> Just because we have no official answer on how fast blaster bolts are compared to bullets in sw doesn't mean we should jump to some completely unreliable method. 

Frame-calcing as a method isn't unreliable at all. It's extremely accurate. It's the medium itself that's inconsistent. And yes, when we have nothing else to go off of, we should use framecalcs. 

> It's not like blaster bolts have to be even close to the speed of a bullet for anakin to be able to easily block the bullets one man can fire at him. Anakin stops blaster fire form 100s of droids at once regularly,

I don't think you understand how bullet-timing works. Just because you can dodge and block multiple far slower projectiles, doesn't mean you can stop a much faster one. I'm pretty sure I can weave between a bunch of balloons thrown at me, yet I can't dodge an arrow after it's been fired.

> he has way beyond peak human speed and agility. 

Nah not at all. He's considerably slower than comic peak humans. And his agility is not ""way higher"". Sure he can jump higher than most peak humans, but he's not nearly as acrobatic as Batman, Nightwing, Daredevil, etc.

> It's absurd to think he'd be overwhelmed by just WS firing bullets at him.

I never said he'll be ""overwhelmed"". I said, bullets will give him trouble because they're much, much faster than the projectiles he's used to. I'm not convinced that he can even block a bullet after it's fired. It's one thing to know that the bullet is being fired with precog, it's another thing to have the physical speed to dodge it. Which Anakin does not. 

> My bad i assumed you were familiar with combat in SW there are countless times force users have been stated to be moving FTE,

Again, your condescending attitude will get you nowhere. Did you skip over the part where I specifically said ""Also give me examples of ""half decent force users"" moving FTE in canon.""? I know that Legends has a shitton of FTE feats. Canon has little to none.

> but this guy made a comment linking a few good speed feats from anakin when he was just 14

None of those indicate FTE movement. The first two are just force feats and not speed feats at all. The third just shows that he has better eyesight than the other Jedi due to his force connection. And the fourth isn't FTE, he just moved faster than those bandits could react. There's a big difference.

I don't really see what this has to do with anything I said? 


>Anyway, I'm probably wasting my time because I'm getting downvoted by angry Sakura fan just by stating fact and people seems to forget she is a side character and what's wrong about liking a side character more than others characters?

You're getting down vote because of the condescending way you worded your comment. My favorite character is Shikamaru, a side character. No one cares who someone's favorite characters are lol. 


>Most of the hate come from the fact the anime ended with her wedding and as a side character become the heroine of a movie.

Personally I just thought the movie felt forced, boring, and contradicting to Canon material. Naruto can't get out of the Genjutsu but Sakura can? Okay lol. 


>I can understand the frustration from Sakura fan since Hinata got way more attention and more loved than Sakura even stated by Kishimoto himself Hinata is his favorite female character in the latest interview.

Okay? I'm a Sakura fan but I just don't like Hinata because of her poorly written and developed character. Being anyone's favorite literally changes nothing for me. Way more love and attention than Sakura? In the anime, likely, yeah. The animation studio has always been heavily biased towards her. 

No offense but what does this comment have to do with anything? "
"> This is certainly true, but doesn't align with what the religious people say. Humans are most definitely more important according to them. Just read the other reply in this post.

I'm not sure who you are referring to when you say ""the religious people"" but it certainly aligns with what certain religious people say. As far as people who take humans to be the most important are concerned, you'd have to ask them. They might hold the belief for aesthetic reasons, because it grants them personal power, from experienced revelation, or because all their friends think so. I don't think the position is inherently arrogant, although it certainly can be presented in such a way. 

The title of this post assumes God (generally taken to be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent), in which case God is free to manifest as It pleases. That is, God can hold mutually contradictory perspectives simultaneously. It can create a being who is oblivious to its Creator, It can create a being who holds itself to be God's finest work and whose highest purpose is celebrating that or whose highest purpose is a horrendous fall from grace, It can create a being who feels it is worthless in the eyes of its Creator, and It can create a being who vehemently denies its Creator. God is trans-rational, trans-logical, trans-everything. God has no confines. 

Working from the assumption of God, I see no issue as to why his focus could be on humans or why the position would be considered inherently arrogant. If we were operating from the assumption that there is no God and launching our discussion from there, then this point is irrelevant, a non-issue. It seems to me then that the actual issue is the existence or involvement of God in human affairs. 

> Really? How? I'll assume you mean the last sentence ""at least think about it""? The problem is, they don't. They simply have faith and don't want to think about it.

To be clear, your position itself (as with competing positions) is not inherently arrogant. Its presentation is and gave me the same feeling of an evangelical-type who is set in his ways and either wants to sell me something or berate me. 

The title of the post directs attention towards the issue of arrogance in religion, assumes the existence of a creator God, and then presents a question about God's focus in relation to humans. This is fine but then the content of the post doesn't coherently and explicitly articulate your position on the question, reasons for adopting your position, and problems with competing positions. It tosses around some questions, calls humans unimpressive, and says that the idea that God cares about human morality is outrageous without saying why. For good measure you throw in that you can't believe people fall into thinking all these ideas about God and condemn them for their sloppy thinking. The fact that you don't understand why people would think such things is implicitly included in the fact that you're posting this, it doesn't add anything to the discussion, and you haven't presented your position or criticism of a position in a particularly lucid way. In short, your presentation is arrogant since it isn't backed by substance and adopts a tone that can be easily perceived as condescending. 

For the record, I don't particularly have an issue with arrogance but it seemed ironic that your post had the same feel as an evangelical-type blowing a lot of air, just with a different coat of paint. I think it's important to be clear on your intent when posting something like this. Were you actually looking for an intellectual discussion about this topic? If so, your post could use increased depth and clarity. Were you looking to dissuade people from the position that humans are special in the eyes of God because you believe it to be individually and/or socially harmful? If so, you should present your position in a wiser and more compassionate manner, attempt to authentically see the perspective of the people responding, and then try to guide them to a more rational position if you believe you hold an elevated view and can see where they are stuck. Or maybe you were just trying to blow off some steam, in which case I hope you got what you were looking for. "
"> There are laws in place that determine what is and what isn’t - but the more money a company has, the more pressure they can put on a social media website to remove content they perceive as “damaging” to their brand (Even if it’s just a parody).

That is our current situation yes, but do you think that is a good thing?

> Now imagine government with all of its incompetence and corruption attempting to do this..and it should be incredibly obvious that this will not end well.

Do you think governments have no say in what constitutes parody and what doesn't in our current systems?

> 100% agree.

> ..and as can be seen by the latest and greatest algorithms used by a company worth billions of dollars like YouTube - the tech is nowhere near having the ability to use nuance and discernment.

I'm confused. You write you 100% agree it's a matter of sufficiently sophisticated algorithms, but then in your next paragraph dismiss the idea altogether.

A large part of product development is learning by doing and no system will be perfect or free of error. That's how it's always been and probably will be in the foreseeable future of our species.

How do you propose Youtube should develop better tech as it is now and in the future if not by this principle? It is not a new and untested approach to science.

> Because the algorithms used only reflect what the humans behind them choose for them to reflect..and part of that is bias.

> That bias can be seen in both YouTube and facebooks algorithm, that removes content deemed “hateful” or “problematic”.

> This becomes a problem, because if the bias of the person running the algorithms decides anything that opposes there views falls into these categories..it gets censored.

You write that human intuition principally is better than any tech we can develop, but that human judgement is prone to bias and that that is a bad thing when determining what should be allowed and what should not.

Which one is it? Man or machine?

> We’re already seeing this happening everywhere.

Where exactly is this happening and what kind of technology are the governments using?

> Sure, and now we have the NSA spying on all of us through smart phones, TV’s ect to tighten the governments grasp over citizens actions.

So you think the invention of the internet was a step in the wrong direction of our technology? After all the prerequisite for mass surveillance as it is today is the existence of the internet.

So what is it? A good thing or a bad thing in your opinion?

> Do you think allowing things to get worse is a good thing?

How do you decide what should be allowed and what should not, and what information do you have that concludes it will be worse?

> Just because it was bad before doesn’t mean we should extend it further.

That principle will completely stifle any progress in developing new inventions, new research and consequently technology.

Why should anyone even attempt to develop and progress our inventions when the general direction is determined by you or anyone else?

Ironically it sounds an awful lot like censorship.

> I think we should avoid enforcing tech through government that has the potential to become tyrannical..but again, that should be obvious to anyone.

But you want people to decide what is potentially tyrannical and what is not. Who do you want to decide for you and how do they reach their decisions?

> Because I’m basing it on the current billion dollar ones used to moderate the websites I mentioned before..which require constant human intervention.

But according to your posts human intuition and intervention is a good approach to decide what is allowed and what is not.

So who should be the decider?

> It’s a perfect example that we’re not they’re yet..and it also doesn’t fix the issue of human bias/corruption.

Again, human intuition and bias is a good thing according to your previous posts, so why does it need to be fixed and how?

> If you think an out of touch government will make better algorithms..I have some bad news for you.

Out of touch regarding what exactly and are governments supposed to mind their own business in deciding what should be permissable and what shouldn't?

If you think the development of math and technology should be a private endeavor... I have some bad news for you.

FFS you're using a governmental invention right now so why do you use this technology if it's a bad thing and a step in the wrong direction?

> ..If you completely ignore all the issues I and others have brought up - while also turning a blind eye towards the governments current corruption, sure.

What issues exactly? You contradict yourself in every other paragraph so I honestly can't figure out what kind of system you want.

And who is claiming we should turn a blind eye to corruption in our governments?

> So you want law enforcement to arrest people for lies?

> Yeah..sounds like a great idea..lol.

I'm sorry to say, but you seem very much out of touch with how our systems actually work. Law enforcements already decides what kind of lies are allowed and what kind is not.

And please don't just lol at ideas that you disagree with if you want people to take you serious. That is not a constructive way of determining which ones are good and which ones are bad.

> Who gets to determine what is and isn’t fake news?

All kinds of people, technology and algorithms does and ideally it should be based on facts and not lies in my opinion.

But again you're contradicting yourself so I'll ask you one more time: Is human intuition and decision making a good thing or bad thing when determining what is fact and what is not.

And do you seriously think that everyone should have carte blanche to write or say whatever they want without consequence regardless of what is true and what is not?

> What if it’s the Trump administration that gets to decide?

That's what they're doing as we speak.

Do you really think Donald Trump is being honest in his claims and do you really think his lies should be of no consequence?

> Might wanna think this one through a bit more..

That's a very condescending perspective isn't it? If you have ever gone out and canvassed (which I have - I have experience talking to the ""stupids"" you refer to, and they are anything but), I think you'd know that people aren't nearly as unreasonable as you're saying.

Sure, some people are, but those are Trump's core supporters. They aren't the ones that are going to be convinced by anything you say, no matter how ""simple"" you put it. Everyone else is motivated by a couple of issues. Sure, people care about all kinds of issues, but there are maybe three that really motivate them. You find out what those issues are (which is what canvassing is about) and then you campaign on that. You can see an example of that on this very subreddit; some people are very willing to tolerate a lot of flexibility in economic policy as long as candidates are pro-choice, anti-Trump, and take liberal positions on the social issues that (frankly) most affect white people."

TBH, I think teaching qualifications are vastly overrated. If someone wants you to have a degree in the subject you are teaching, then fair enough, but I don't see what advantage a teaching qualification can give you. It limits your chance to properly study an actual subject and you can learn most teaching skills through doing the job.

Its such a ham handed and fake ""concern"" that they likely laugh at you behind your back for being so transparently disingenuous. Like you ""care"" about them. Its a joke. you know it. they know it.

and what ""dots"" are you trying to connect? You guys use these weasel words like ""influence"" the election. You mean seeing the evidence? so you wish you just could have hidden her 33,000 email fiasco and these emails that clearly detailed dem fraud and corruption? SO if you ""just could have hidden the facts"" it would be ""fair""? Worse yet, is that you are blaming putin when the leaker has straight up said it was a democratic insider!!!!! SO exactly what ""dots are you ""just trying to connect"" ""for them"". Its completely dishonest by you, no wonder they reject your faux ""concern""


>revealed that you were conned, it'd be an incredibly hard thing to accept.

Why, because we saw emails that laid bare the duplicity of the democratic party? Because quite frankly I dont know one single trump person that wasnt ALREADY voting trump for a very very long time before that. Personally, its been since march. So its quite insulting for you to claim people were ""conned"" by a DEMOCRATIC INSIDER EMAIL LEAK when we were already voting for trump in the first place.

>revealed that you were conned, it'd be an incredibly hard thing to accept.

this exposes you for the disingenuous poster that you are. You pretend some sort of ""concern"" for them, but are the most biased of hillary voters, condescending to others and then feign surprise that they dont imbibe your ""wisdom""

>tricked

Tricked? Again, incredibly wrong and insulting. You are erroneously claiming here that the ONLY reason they voted for trump is because of the emails? I literally dont know a single trump voter that was not already voting for him WAAAAY before that. If those guys were reagan voters, 1000000000% they were decided for trump WAY before the emails.

I have a feeling your idea of fighting back is trying to bully the bullies, and that won't work. They're dragging you down to their level and beating you with experience.

Fighting back is about setting boundaries and guarding them. When they cross the line you set them straight and make a tactical retreat. It varies situation to situation, but the general idea is being on the defensive.

Welcome to life. Doing the right thing and standing up for yourself is hard. That's why bullies are bullies: it's easier than doing the right thing. Bullies always have, and always will get away with it. No amount of social / school reform will change it. Only you can change it for yourself.

LMAO. So while you're telling me not to use logical fallacies, you use one yourself? Just because you're high diamond (so am I), and you say you don't ever bank minerals like this (ok...), doesn't meant it never happens in diamond, high diamond or not. What you're saying doesn't make sense.

Also, don't fucking condescend to me about using big words when you say shit like this:

>semi concomitant
Not to mention the numerous run-on sentences.

>Besides you missed the entire point of my post which was making fun of the zerg player for blaming his entire loss on blizzard buffing the mines.

The widow mine is overpowered. Not only that, the way it functions is inherently bad game design. The zerg is totally correct to complain about it. It needs to be fixed.

>If you watched any starcraft at all then you would know that there is such a thing as ""The mistake that cost him the game.""

I play starcraft. I don't give a fuck about some sensationalist caster hyping up some big play that happened.

>It happens all the time: Hellions get surrounded and killed by ling and he cant stop the all in. Blink stalkers snipe medivacs because the terran tried a doom drop for no reason, making too many drones after scouting/not scouting something. It happens all the time and casters talk about it after games. You hear it all the time ""X was really the moment that cost him the game. If had done Y instead he would have been fine. There was really no reason for him to do X.""

Except people can still win after something like that happens. Having your hellions surrounded doesn't mean you auto-lose. Besides, banking ~3k minerals for a zerg isn't all that unusual. It's a mistake, but it's not all that weird for the level they were playing at, which is plat. It's fucking ludicrous to pretend that a plat zerg player floating 3k minerals at the 17 minute mark is ""THE"" reason he lost.


>Everything I am saying is coherent, but you are just not grasping any of it and then saying it is ""dumb shit."" It is very clear that you don't know much about the game because if you did you would have a solid argument, and you do not.

Yeah you can't say shit like this if you haven't addressed the things I've said. Zergs float minerals more than the other races. You're looking at the zerg's mistake, but you're not counting the mistakes that this (plat) terran obviously made throughout the game. That's not logical. The terran himself even said he was supply blocked hardcore at one point. And again, what if terran had no money because he had a bunch of units queued up? WHAT IF HE HAD NO MONEY BECAUSE THE ZERG RUINED HIS ECONOMY? What you call ""good macro"" may actually be BAD macro. What if put down like 10 CCs to get rid of his minerals? Do you see the problem with this dumb ass bullshit you're throwing out? Stop wasting my time.


>(ps there is really no argument because as I said before I was making fun of the zerg for blaming it all on the mines. So I am not even sure why you are trying to contest anything)

The zerg is right and you are wrong to make fun of him. Widow mines are overpowered.

">But you ARE here to debate he morality of eating animals, when you ask why we should or should not eat an... animal. I'm sorry if you're mind is made up and you don't want to hear debate on the matter, but maybe CMV isn't the subreddit for you then?

There's no need to be condescending. It's very obvious from my responses here that I am here to debate and I've already awarded multiple deltas to users who've challenged my view succesfully. 

>And you continue to go on about 'wasted' animals, when you've already delta'd somebody for explaining that isn't true. Again, very disingenuous.

Like I've explained twice now, I awarded a delta for the fact that some of these animals are used after their deaths. My previous position was that all 3 million are wasted. Now I know that maybe 1.5 million or so actually are used up. This doesn't drop the waste factor down to zero. There's nothing disingenuous about this, I've been upfront from the first response.


>Cats and Dogs are animals and a debate about whether or not to eat them should be FULL, not artificially limited. Afterall people die every day, we could eat them as well, but we don't. The ethics and morality of eating people is something we take seriously, despite the fact that they are 'going to waste'.

Putting aside the fact that the risks from eating a person are incredibly higher than those of eating a cat or a dog, my title is CMV: There is no logical reason we should not eat cats or dogs. This is why the debate is different than CMV: If we eat cows and pigs we should also eat cats and dogs. While the emotional arguments against eating all animals are many, the logical arguments against eating animals are much smaller. The logical argument about using meat that would otherwise go to waste (again, not all of it but still some of it) as food for those who can't afford it is even smaller.

>And I think you need to realistically consider that if we make it a culturally customary practice to eat cats and/or dogs, that you've got to expect that people wil be more inclined to kill these animals for food.

This is a good point actually, and something I had not considered. However the idea you're presenting is too speculative for me to comment on, and either way I don't think it would be enough to dissuade me from thinking the benefits outweigh the potential negatives.

"hahahahaha 

>this is a perfect microcosm of the way in which the communities surrounding popular anime force out dissenting opinions.

Only inside a thread directly about it man, you would be hailed as king if you said something negative about AOT outside of this thread.

But since you are in an AOT thread, it's like walking into a stadium and announcing to everyone that you are not interested in that sport. Everyone there just either doesn't care, or gets agitated. No matter how you word it you give off a strong condescending vibe which is the main reason for this specific downvoting ""microcosm"". "
